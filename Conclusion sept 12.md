## Summary old


This dissertation has defended the claim that human beings are practical rational primates and hence *ought* to become fully practically wise. 

The potential for wisdom is part of who and what we are. Actualizing that potential is both *natural* (according to the sense of 'natural' I have defended) and *ethically* obligatory. 

As Julia Annas summarizes, non-reductive naturalisms risk trivializing moral or normative facts by implausibly cordoning them within humans: "Non-naturalistic accounts of ethical terms assume that their function, prominently their normativity, is something that arises with humans, or is produced by humans, in a way which owes nothing to the nature which we share with other living things."[@annas2005naturalism 12] That link is supplied by Foot (and Thompson et. al.) As Annas continues: 

>What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out...[@annas2005naturalism]

Virtue ethics is, on my view, a very useful guide to action, in personal life, political life, bioethics,[@beauchamp2001principles] business,[@beadle2015macintyre] and education.[@carr2005virtue] It would be an improvement to almost any area of human life if we were aware of our own vices and worked to expunge them, and if we understood the virtues and pursued them. Yet many obstacles from philosophical and social tradition stand in the way. My dissertation is part of an attempt to remove such obstacles and, in their absence, render not only palatable but desirable a pursuit of virtues. 

Virtue, practical reason, and flourishing are age-old themes. Nevertheless, they are significant themes. Treating them adequately requires more work than I can claim to have done here. As Glaucon said to Socrates, "The measure of listening to such discussions is the whole of life."[@plato *Republic* 450 b.] 


## Summary of Dissertation


My account argued that virtue is excellence in rational practice and practical reasoning.  Insofar as virtue is necessarily related to practical rationality, an account of practical reason was needed.  I argued that practical reasoning is the capacity for identifying and acting on practical reasons. As practical reasoners, we observe some facts as practical reasons. I briefly argued that some mundane natural facts are at the same time practical reasons. Just as speculative reason is by definition the faculty for judging true and false, practical reason by definition judges worth or its absence. A practical reason can and does motivate one, all by itself; in conjunction with or absent other immediate inclinations or desires. Practical reason, furthermore, motivates when one judges that a course of action or an outcome is good in itself, that it is *desirable* in the sense that it is to be desired whether one presently desires it or not. For human beings, practical reasoning is natural reasoning; and for human beings, reasoning well is natural goodness. 


## Oversights

My account cannot pretend to address every incisive objection or cover every crucial topic. One shortcoming is the lack of a full discussion of social reasoning. If, as MacIntyre has argued, we learn to reason within a social tradition, the problem of cultural relativism about rationality looms large. Another shortcoming is the absence of a discussion about the relation between virtue ethics and religious morality. Virtue ethics is often associated with religious philosophy, and indeed Christian, Muslim, and Jewish philosophers are often virtue ethicists. Nevertheless, Foot, McDowell and others are non-religious philosophers who find in Aristotle a secular alternative that is neutral with respect to these issues. 

My hope is to play some part in showing the plausibility and practicality of the notion that even "we modern knowers, we godless anti-metaphysicians" have every reason to pursue virtue and wisdom.^[Frederich Nietzsche, *The Gay Science* section 344.] 


## Ethics and Metaethics

Alan Gibbard points out that the hard line between ethics (which is about substantive, normative matters) and metaethics (about questions of meaning) traces back to G.E. Moore. To understate matters, not everyone agrees with Moore:

>Some philosophers have rejected the distinction; some Kantians, for instance, think that if you get the metatheory right, substantive ethical conclusions fall out as some kind of consequence, so that metaethics and substantive ethics are not really separate. Then too, anyone who rejects Sidgwick's and Moore's indefinability claim and thinks that ethical terms can be given analytic, naturalistic definitions thinks that the two putative subdivisions are not really separate. Those who reject any systematic distinction between questions of meaning and questions of substance might likewise reject a sharp, separate subject of metaethics.[@gibbard2003normative 320]

Foot also rejects the systematic distinction between questions of meaning and substance. In her theory, she not only subverts long-held assumptions about what it means to do moral philosophy but gives fresh insight into the kind of life one might live. 

## Why Foot is Awesome

One of the dangers of doing moral philosophy without considering the theories of other times, places, and cultures is that we risk improperly concentrating on some pet virtues and vices particular to ourselves. Good moral philosophy should not only clarify our concepts but enlarge our horizon. Foot's theory of natural goodness is an excellent example of this kind of moral philosophy. 

Neo-Aristotelianism aims to provide a unified solution to multiple interesting puzzles in metaethics, ethics, philosophy of science, philosophy of action, and others. This solution, for whatever it's continued shortcomings, is of interest to a wide swath of researchers and thinkers. 

In my view, the Footian sort of neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is rightly enjoying a new renaissance in contemporary analytic ethics and beyond, for it is both perfectly compatible with the modern scientific worldview and also useful in education, business, and everyday life. 





## Why Ethics is like Science

The question of how to live, and of how to resolve pressing moral disputes and dramatic moral conundrums, is not easy. There are many answers, and people disagree. Anyone who has long engaged in dialectical disputes over the various answer to the normative question of how to live well eventually comes to ask a secondary question: is there even any truth to be found? Are there any ‘right answers’ in ethics? Is there anything to all this discussion besides gas? Some worry that ethics has no ‘right answers’ because it is all just intuition-pumping. Some people view ethics as too easy because it is only a discussion of one’s opinion.  We must admit that normative ethical conclusions — whatever conclusions satisfy us at the end of a long philosophical discussion about what is good and right — are different from conclusions in paleontology, medicine, or calculus. What does the difference amount to? Why is ethics *as a discipline* so different from, say, natural sciences? 


There are two sorts of interpretations of ethics as a discipline in light of the diversity of answers to the question about how to live well. The first is Hume’s answer, that ethics is “easy” (while metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophical anthropology are presumably difficult). 

The second is Aristotle’s, that ethics is *a different sort of science* because it has a *different subject matter* to which it must correspond. He says, “For a well schooled man searches for that degree of precision in each kind of study which the nature of the subject at hand admits: is obviously just as foolish to accept arguments of probability from a mathematician has to demand strict demonstrations from an orator.” [@aristotle Book I.3]

By the traditional classification, ethics is a form of philosophy. Russ Shafer-Landau persuasively argues this simple equation in defense of moral realism[@shafer2007foundations ethics] but the point has broader import. If ethics is *not* a species of philosophy, it is something else entirely. Perhaps it is a species of psychology, politics, or evolutionary anthrpology. Such a categorization assumes, at the outset, that power prevails over truth. But to concede that there are no right answers in ethics, that ethical philosophers have no hope of finding any ethical truth is to give up on ethics as a discipline. 

So suppose ethics is a species of philosophy, as Shafer-Landau argues.[@shafer2012ethics] Then the fate of ethical theories hangs on the fate of philosophical claims and theories as a whole. If we are philosophical optimists at all — if we are not total skeptics or nihilists — then we can be ethical optimists. 

So what species of philosophy is ethics? If philosophy is its genus, what is its differentia? As I have been arguing, ethics is the discipline of practical reason. There are right answers in ethics since there are right ways to live one’s life, there are wells to live well and ways to live poorly; things can go well or badly for us.
