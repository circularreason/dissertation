Although it seems virtues are cultural, they are 'human traits' in that they express human nature. MacIntyre does not basis virtue enough in metaphysical biology; Foot grounds it too much in metaphysical biology; McDowell grounds virtue in reason but does not explain the relation of reason to metaphysical biology. Foot is closest to my view, but I supplement her view with arguments to the effect that normativity (including teleology) is built-in to nature as a whole, not just humanity.

## Applying generics

It should be more clear now how the argument will work. Humans are natural entities about whom generic, teleological statements are true and can be used as the basis of evaluative truths. By calling humans 'natural' I do not mean to invoke here all the controversies surrounding the word. For now, calling us 'natural' is an innocent truism. Are we here, in nature? Yes. Are we material -- not necessarily *wholly* material, but are we *at least* material at all? Yes. Do we eat food grown on earth, drink water from the earth, are we born from fellow humans and do we die and disintegrate into the earth like every other living thing? Yes. So we are natural. Again, I do not mean to prejudge the question of whether we are *also more than natural*. I simply mean to invoke the obvious that the *we are at least natural*.

Since we are (at least) natural entities, and since scientific statements are about natural entities, then it is possible (and indeed quite common) to make scientific statements about us. 'Humans emigrated from Africa about 200,000 years ago' is a statement about a natural species group, namely *homo sapiens sapiens*, the only extant members of the hominin clade. 'Humans are language users' is a generic scientific statement. 

'Human beings are rational animals' is a generic. It is also evaluative/normative. An *irrational* human is ipso facto defective. To call a human 'defective' sounds like a schoolyard insult; but it is a straightforward, evaluative description of some people. I do not here intend to discuss mental illness, disability, birth defect, chromosomal disorders, and other such exceptions to 'normal' functional humans. 

Can we get from such vague statements to particular moral statements? 'Human beings make and keep promises.' Perhaps. Here is one way such a connection might work. 

From 'human beings are rational animals' we can derive 'human beings are language users' by the major premise that 'rational animals are language users.' This major premise is, I think, eminently plausible. One of the identifiers of rationality of other animals (dolphins, great apes) is simply the presence of language. Language is, I presume, a system of signs; if a crow or even an insect such as a bee can be shown to be using signs, many would conclude that ipso facto those creatures would be rational in some sense. Regardless, the question of whether any other animals besides us are rational is identical to the question of whether any other animal uses language the way we do. 

So what does it mean to be a language user? One of the things language can do is refer to events not yet happened, or events no longer happening. To express intentions to do X or not Y in the future requires language. There is some connection here, perhaps not enough, but some connection between language use and promise keeping. A kind of necessity. 

Ignorance is not good for human beings. 'Rational animals seek knowledge when they have plenty of food, water, and shelter.' is perhaps another safe generic. One might say I am trying to express "the value of knowledge" or some such fluffy phrase, but I am not doing any such thing. I am trying to articulate a true, scientific generic about human beings as they are. Certainly, it is a normative statement; but so is 'lizards seek warm rocks at night time.' One can disagree with the truth value of a statement like 'rational animals seek knowledge' but one cannot throw out the whole category of such statements without also denying my starting premise, that all such scientific statements are systematically false. 

Explorations of 'what rationality *is*' are bound to be controversial. I do not want to develop a fully formed theory of rationality here. I only want to articulate a few possible specific examples of generic statements that (in my terms) are evaluative truths true in virtue of our species, that (in my opponents terms) do double duty as scientific descriptions and "moral" norms. These examples are needed to give some flesh and bones to my primary contention, that there exist *at least some* true scientific evaluative statements about humans. 

One more will suffice here. 'Rational beings seek the good.' I don't mean that we always seek what is *actually* good; a jihadist is seeking a great evil which they have mistaken for a good. Nor does it mean that we *actually* seek what is good; an immoderate, overweight, diabetic person may quite intentionally overeat, knowing how unhealthy it is. A habitually foolish person may spend all her money every time she receives a paycheck, even though she knows she will never be able comfortably to retire. Rational beings seek the good. 


## 3. Why is it "necessary" to be virtuous? 

Although it seems that virtues are optional, they partly constitute human flourishing, which everyone ought to want, while the vices partly constitute misery, which everyone ought to avoid.  

It is necessary because it is human. Justice, prudence, and courage are "needed in any human-scale enterprise"[@geach ], from motherhood, to a successful career, to farming. Put negatively, the thesis of this chapter is that vices necessarily contribute to misery, unhappiness, and human stultification and stagnation. Human nature is the starting point, flourishing is the goal, and the moral and intellectual virtues are the means by which we move from start to goal. 

## Vices are despicable qualities that constitute misery

Put negatively, vices are those qualities that partly constitute human misery. Many kinds of living conditions are miserable; excessive cold or heat; starvation; illness; mental handicap; injury; extreme isolation and loneliness, and so on. But these kinds of circumstances are not *always* and *necessarily* miserable. Rather, being a lying, treacherous, scheming, envious, whining, daydreaming good-for-nothing is truly miserable, even such happens to have a comfortable bed to sleep in and enough money to get through life. Such a person is despicable, a worthy specimen of human failure. 

Some vices, especially intellectual vices, are especially despicable. Not everyone has equal amounts of intelligence conceived as raw mental horsepower. Some children even at a young age excel at doing “mental math” or memorizing geographical names, while others never acquire the knack for it. However, not all unintelligent people are stupid in the deplorable sense: stubborn, unteachable, slow to learn and resenting every bit, arrogant, smug, self-satisfied, and willfully ignorant. Such persons demonstrate intellectual vices noxious to all their fellows except those equally debased, and especially noxious to those unfortunate enough to be their teachers, parents, or guardians. And such intellectual vices are in a special way exemplary of human failing. 

### An example

When I asked my students why they took this class, about one half said, “My friend [or sister or brother] took it and told me, ‘you *have* to take this class.” Thompson’s insight bears out in this example. The student was asked for a reason; they reported being told what they must do; they did it. 

The recommendation to take the class was presented as a categorical imperative. It was presented as a practical necessity. Whether the conditions or the agent’s character were irrelevant, or whether the proper conditions were assumed to be met, the conditions were not mentioned. 


### Good by definition? 

A problem is about the very definition of virtue as a *beneficial* or “positive” character trait. To see the problem, suppose we define “boldness” as *doing hard things* and “courage” as doing hard things when it is good. Boldness is, so to speak, value neutral. One can be bold in wrongdoing or bold in doing well. If courage is just boldness in doing good, is this a trivial truth? An analytic truth? The affirmation that ‘courage (doing hard things when it is good) is good’ would appear to amount to the life-altering revelation that good things are good. 

## What are we? Rational animals

 Human nature is our differentia, animal is our genus. Rationality is a capacity for thinking what to do, thinking what is best, for reflecting on what was is will be might be or must be best. So motivation most broadly is necessarily related to reasons one discovers and endorses, especially reasons that count in favor of an action or attitude, all things considered . 
- Practical rationality is not merely irrational 
- Reason is not merely impractical 
- It is not merely value neutral
- It is not merely procedural

### Human Origins

What is human nature? In short, we don’t know. For all we can tell without the benefit of divine revelation, humanity is an anomaly. Our origin is shrouded in mystery, our destiny undecided. The story we are told in biology and anthropology textbooks is that 200,000 years ago, hominids somehow developed new cognitive abilities sufficient to justify calling one or a set of these creatures “the first humans.” Our earliest direct, archaeological evidence of our ancestors is that they were artists: paintings adorn the caves of France. 


### Human Destinies

If our origin is shrouded in mystery, our future destiny is relatively clear. By any account, our species is doomed.  The science fiction dream of off-world colonies is most likely just a dream: no livable other planet has been discovered within our solar system or any of the surrounding regions. Even if one were discovered further out, along concentric circles each light years in diameter, the practical limitations on space travel for large numbers across unimaginable distances render off-world colonization virtually impossible. The only possibility left, itself highly impracticable, seems to me that scientific technology advances to a point that we can conceivably *create* an atmosphere on a planet that does not currently have one. 

Regardless of these dreams, if our current planet does not go into an ice age, or a dust bowl, or become a nuclear wasteland, or if a volcanic canopy does not eliminate conditions for organic life, then *eventually* the running down of our sun will condemn our species to the same fate of 99% of all species that have existed up until now: extinction.

Bertrand Russell faced this pessimistic doom with a set jaw, open eyes, and intellectual courage. 

### Moral Education ####

The beginning and end of practical life are the least discussed but most important. 

Often the biggest and most obvious facts are the hardest to see. For example, when I ask students to point out anything they see — anything at all, hidden or apparent —  they typically look around and start naming medium-sized objects in their field of vision: this chair, that wall, that tree, that person, or perhaps those atoms and molecules, that sunlight. They never say the biggest and most obvious thing: the ground. 

When discussing the morality of adults, we often leave out the biggest and most obvious source of our morality. The source of our morality is not our professors in college, our ethics textbooks, our favorite novel, or even (for religious folk) our Holy Bible. The biggest and most obvious fact about our morality (and our moral psychology and a whole lot else) is our parents. 

Most of us grew up in the context of nuclear families. So our biological parent or parents both conceived, raised, cared for, and educated us — including education in do’s and don’ts of life. 

The reason we must keep parents in mind is that the two most significant periods, in one sense of significance, of our ethical lives are the very beginning and the very end. 

The latter phase of human life, say, from 50-80 (for those who live that long) is the period in which our habits are most firmly established and the consequences of our choices are most apparent. There is a time delay between the decision to cultivate a character trait and the rewards (or punishments) of becoming that kind of person. 

The middle period (say, ages 25-55) are where we are most autonomous. We are fully functioning agents. We have projects, aims, goals, ethical principles (or a principled lack thereof), weaknesses, given temptations, vices, defects, as well as strengths, virtues, and a host of other habits we may call morally neutral. This is also the period when we philosophers tend to write books about morality. But just because this is the period in which moral philosophers write books about morality doesn’t mean this period is the most moral significant. 

There is a truism that all the really significant doctrines about life — all the really lasting beliefs and habits — we don’t learn in school; we learn them all by the time we enter school (around age 5). We learn how to relate to other humans, how to relate to authority, how to speak our native language, we learn (for the most part, but not exclusively) what is valuable in life — learning, money, position, friendship, power, and so on. 

## Is there such thing as human nature or has Darwinism abolished that notion?[@hursthouse1998 chapter ?; @brown2008 chapter 5] 

A worry: Bernard Williams and others object that human nature is a “mess” and so the virtues cannot be perfections of our nature; 

This thought is the powerful (if vague) Darwinian objection from metaphysics that there is no such thing as a biological “nature” anyway. 



## Is there one human nature, no human nature, or many 'second natures'?

[@mcdowell1996mind; @foot2001natural chapter 5; @toner2008sorts] 

## Do virtues even exist or does the 'situationist challenge' render such talk empirically suspect? 

## If virtues are excellence for us what are we? We are animals, we are rational beings? 

## Is there any way to know what we are? 



## Is practical reason better understood along Humean or Kantian lines -- or something else?

Does Brown say this: "Human nature is variability itself."[@brown1999human]
