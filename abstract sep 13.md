This dissertation is about ethical naturalism. I defend Philippa Foot's sort of ethical naturalism against that of John McDowell. I assume that scientific naturalism is true and ask whether and how one can be a moral realist about virtues like moderation and practical wisdom. I answer in the affirmative. Organisms have intrinsic, natural, normative properties such as life, health, and well-functioning. Organisms can be 'good' or 'defective' according to how well they can do their characteristic activities. So human organisms have such properties, and can be good or defective, according to how well they do their characteristic activity, which is (at least) practical reasoning. So our notions of science and nature have to organic life and the science of biology, rather than pursuing the Laplacian dream of reducing all of nature to the physical and all sciences to physics and math.  The good life for human beings, from both an "external" and "internal" view of ourselves, is a life of pursuing virtue and wisdom.
