## Virtue Criteria

1. The argument in brief is this: It is possible to express in generic propositions scientific knowledge about the life form and natural teleology of natural organisms. (Scientific realism). And Humans are natural organisms. (Naturalism) Therefore, it is possible to express in generic propositions scientific knowledge about the life form and natural teleology of human beings. (Ethical naturalism) 
2. Specifically, the argument is that (1) humans are practical rational animals. (2) As animals and practical reasoners, we can actuate our life form by growing mature and becoming wise. (3) Virtues are those qualities that constitute maturity and wisdom according to our life form. 
3. The first proposition that needs support is the premise that humans are natural organisms who are subject, as all organisms, to evaluation according to the patterns of natural normativity. 
4. In other words, evaluating a good human being requires identifying what is characteristic of the species in question. It requires identifying our life form, our nature, the archetype of a human being. The set of "characteristic" features of a human being -- the human life-form or nature -- is expressible in generics. 
5. It is possible to express in generic propositions scientific knowledge about the life form and natural teleology of human beings. 
4. Now, one might object that human nature is variability itself.  
5. Nevertheless, all humans are (a) animals and (b) practical and rational. 
11. Humans are alive, move, live, grow, reproduce, and die. They have a history, a nature, and a destiny. 
10. Humans *speak*. They talk, engage in symbol use in social contexts.
11. Humans *act*; that is, they are practical creatures, that self-determine, self-direct, and so on. 
12. Human's *think*; we use terms like 'reason' and ratio as abstractions to describe a set of capacities we notice in ourselves. For example, activities that get called 'rational' are activities such as to observe, perceive as, create, reflect, decide, determine, abstract, infer, explain, deduce, remember, predict, criticize, praise, blame, admonish, and so on. 
6. As a generic, the truth of this statement is compatible with variability since variability is a function of practical reason, which is universal. 
7. As a generic or formal truth, the truth of this proposition is compatible with humans failing to become practical or rational due to genetic defect, illness, injury, or injustice. 
6. And one might object that there is no human nature because "natures" belong to lower life forms but not humans. 
7. Such animal natures aim at reproduction, not flourishing. 
7. But that simply isn't so. We are rational animals to whom reproduction is obviously not our end. 
15. By the first hypothesis, we should expect this: The qualities of being a good animal, speaking, acting, and thinking well given one's lifeform are, those that from the point of view of the alien anthropologist (a) make one a human being (fully exemplifies the human-life form) (b) make a human being admired by his or her fellows; furthermore, within the moral point of view, (c) one would judge such qualities really admirable -- in other words, such qualities would line up with one's own pre-analytical intuitions about what qualities count as morally praiseworthy. 
16. As animals we are inherently mortal, biological, beings whose life consists of a process of maturation, homeostatic maturity, aging, and death. Human being as rational *animals* by nature need to breathe, eat, sleep, and stay warm, deal with the urgings of our sexual nature, and so on.
(1) Beneficial for
        (1a) admirable from the inside
        (1b) enabling the actuation of, and partly actuating, the life form as would be observable by the alien anthropologist
        (1c) enabling characteristic "functions" or activity, 
(3) Practical, rational -- agential, active, 
       (3a) acquirable
        (3b) corrective
        (3c) whole life
        (3d) deliberative
        (3e) goal-oriented or teleological
        (3f) self-determining
        (3g) taking our animal "givens" as reasons
        (4a) speakers, symbol users
        (4b) knowers
        (4c) self-reflective
        (4d) social
        (4e) traditional
 (3) Animals 
        (2a) mortal
        (2b) grow, mature, eat, drink, sleep, copulate, stay warm, and die
        (2c) given our chemical, embodied, physical, locational situation and embodiednes
17. The virtues would be human-specific tokens of natural goodness conforming to the type characterized above. 

## Virtue Content

1. Our dialectic thus far has defended two major claims: first, that some norms are natural norms; and secondly, that some such norms are natural human norms. These natural norms are expressible in generic propositions of the familiar sort, such as 'acorns become oak trees' and 'human beings are practical rational animals'. The "nature" -- or set of in-built potentialities --  of genetically modern humans is fixed enough to justify such generics. And the pattern of natural normativity discoverable in all organisms predicts that virtues will turn out to be the qualities that enable human beings to become excellent practical rational animals. 
2. The crtieria provided capture virtue as it appears in the neo-Aristotelians. Foot's account of virtue, McDowell's, and MacIntyre's. 
2. Virtues are good of a kind for creatures like us. 
3. This view accords with Judith Thomson's "kindism" and Michael Thompson, Foot, and others. 
4. Virtues are beneficial, acquirable, corrective, and rational human qualities that enable success of a whole human life and of human cultures (societies, traditions).
5. Virtues are the qualities that makes a person human of the kind of being we are: animal, practical, rational. Thinking, acting, speaking in social and political groups.  Since virtues are -- by definition -- admirable qualities, the virtuous person is the admirable person.  
5. Let's look at each attribute and connect it with the criteria we laid out before. 


7. **Virtue is beneficial.** 8. Foot argues virtues are beneficial. Hursthouse calls this "Plato's requirement", that virtues benefit their possessor *necessarily* and *by definition*, not via statistical regularities or positive consequences. They are intrinsic goods. 
8. Foot's account has several attributes I will touch on.
8. MacIntyre agrees. His initial account of virtue just defines virtues as the features that enable success in practices. 
8. This initial part of the definition might seem empty or tautologous. The very definition of virtue as a *beneficial* or “positive” character trait is circular and therefore empty. To see the problem, suppose we define “boldness” as *doing hard things* and “courage” as doing hard things when it is good. Boldness is, so to speak, value neutral. One can be bold in wrongdoing or bold in doing well. If courage is just boldness in doing good, is this a trivial truth? An analytic truth? The affirmation that ‘courage (doing hard things when it is good) is good’ would appear to amount to the life-altering revelation that 'good things are good'.
9. Response to Empty Definition Objection. The Great Platitudes. That virtue is beneficial is a platitude, but it is an important one. 
10. **Virtues are practical**. Foot argues that we must satisfy the practicality requirement but not the way non-cognitivists do. Virtues are excellences of the practical will, or what I shall call practical reason. 
11. MacIntyre agrees. 
12. McDowell agrees. McDowell argues that the virtues are various "sensitivities" to the salient facts about how to live. McDowell's theses are that: (1) "The point of engaging in ethical reflection... lies in the interest of the question 'How should one live?'"[@mcdowell1979virtue 331]. 
13. His first point is that ethical reflection aims at answering the ever relevant question "How should one live?"[@mcdowell1979virtue 331] We notice that ethical reflection is *reflection* about *practice*. It seems to me that this obvious truth is almost too close to be seen, like one’s nose. It is far too often overlooked. We do not *merely* act (like a deer or a dog) nor do we *merely* calculate (like a computer or an angel); we reflect upon what we ought to do, how we ought to live. Such reflection only makes sense concerning issues within my control. Insofar as one cannot but sleep sometimes, the question of whether or not to sleep at all is not an ethical question; it is not in my control. Insofar as one can either stay or go, pursue or avoid, harm or help, such decisions are ethical decisions and the question of how to live is an ethical question. One must decide which larger, longer-term projects to pursue and which objects are worthwhile to obtain; and one must, along the way of these long-term pursuits, decide rather extemporaneously how to react to the vicissitudes of circumstance.  Each of us must decide how to react to the “slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.”^[*Hamlet* III.1]
14. The non-cognitivist solution is not correct. 
13. **Virtues are acquirable**. This is an essential feature of the definition. Virtues are not "givens" nor are they acquired by luck. 
14. There are many kinds of human excellence. VIrtue is only one of them. 
15. Some excellences are acquired by luck. So how to distinguish moral virtue from a great memory, keen eyesight, or other admirable qualities we do not intuitively classify as virtuous?
14. Foot's answer is brilliant. The virtue is a character trait for which one is responsible. Include one's instincts, desires, wishes, preferences, and "second natures."
15. McDowell agrees. Bildung is the process of coming into a space of reasons according to which some things count as reasons for one. 
16. **Virtues are corrective**. Foot's point here is that vice is possible.  That is, each one stands "at a point at which there is some temptation to be resisted or deficiency of motivation to be made good."[@foot2002virtues 8]
17. Virtues that are hard are good to perform (via continence and strong will), but virtues that are easy are better (via fluent second nature). 
18. **Virtues relate to one's whole life**. MacIntyre's "second stage" of his account of virtue is about the whole human life conceived as a unified practice or set of practices. 
19. This point has important implications for the philosophy of action. 
20. Foot agrees. Virtue results in a happy life, where happiness has a kind of deep satisfaction to it, not merely a superficial satisfaction. 
20. McDowell agrees. McDowell argues that the question of how to live must be approached from "within" a moral outlook and approached "*via* the notion of a virtuous person."[@mcdowell1979virtue 331] 

McDowell’s solution to the problem of the "vertigo" we feel when contemplating the dependence of our rational concept-application on nothing more than our shared form of life is to simply accept that we cannot think from a third-person, detached, “sideways on” point of view; we can only think from within our point of view. His main opponent, of course, is the notion that morality can be adduced from an objective third-person sort of view. He says, “The cure for the vertigo, then, is to give up on the idea that philosophical thought, about the sorts of practice in question, should be undertaken at some external standpoint, outside our immersion in our familiar forms of life.”[@mcdowell1979virtue 341] This is part of the movement toward his thesis that that virtues are ethical qualities that only make sense ‘from within’, that they lend a certain kind of perceptive ability to their bearers. 

McDowell points out the familiar case of a discussion or disagreement that end at loggerheads, with both parties asking "But don't you see?" Although it is tempting to want to resolve such loggerheads by appeal to a third-personal point of view standing outside either of our forms of life, McDowell thinks it must be resolved, if at all, from firmly within our form of life. That is not to say that persuasion is not possible. He reassures us that the "Don't you see?" question "can often be supplemented with words aimed at persuasion."[@mcdowell1979virtue 342] Rather, persuasion will consist in "bring[ing] someone to see it as one wants", in one or both parties appreciating reasons they may not have seen before. It sometimes takes efforts to make someone see (to make oneself or others see) "the right way to handle a given situation."[@mcdowell1979virtue 342]

Now, if virtue knowledge is not codifiable then how is it *consistent*? What guarantees that the moral person’s behavior is intelligibly the same from case to case? On the one hand, if moral knowledge is rational then it is consistent from case to case and situation to situation; but if, as McDowell has been arguing, both deductive reasoning and practical reasoning are not merely consistent by being like a rule-following machine or computer, how do we explain the virtuous person's reliably correct behavior? Section 5 of the article answers this question by way of Aristotle's practical syllogisms.

The 'practical syllogism' takes the following shape: 

        1. X is good to do, desirable, worthwhile, etc. (E.g., it is  ood to instantiate justice in the classroom).
        2. Z would be X. (E.g., giving everyone a chance to re-take a quiz that was unavailable due to technical problems would be instantiate justice in my classroom.)        
        3. Therefore, Z would be good to do, desirable, worthwhile, etc. 
On the strictly deductive logical model, the role of the major premise is to provide rock solid universal ethical principles from which to derive particular moral duties. But McDowell resists this model. On the strictly non-cognitivist model, without universal ethical principles we are left with universal psychological states (consistent desires, plans, values, or norms). McDowell also resists this. On the non-codifiable model, what does the major premise do? Its role, he says, is to state a "certain conception of how to live... [namely] the *virtuous person's conception* of the sort of life a human being should lead."[@mcdowell1979virtue 343. Emphasis added.] It is clear upon reflection that this account is a sort of circular reasoning. For the virtuous person's conception of how to live is itself conditioned by what he called earlier 'the moral outlook'. That conception of how to live, in turn, conditions what particular saliences are noticed (what minor premises) and generates practical conclusions about what is to be done. What kind of life should a human being lead? The answer "cannot be definitively written down."[@mcdowell1979virtue 343] Furthermore, "Any attempt to capture it in words will recapitulate the character of the teaching whereby it might be instilled: generalizations will be approximate at best..."[@mcdowell1979virtue 343] The upshot of the combination of non-codifiability with a practical syllogistic form is that the virtuous person takes for a rule of life some conception of how to live but that this conception is part of what it means to be a virtuous person. (Hence the vertigo.)
We might wonder why we are bothering about formal syllogistic reasoning at this point. But this way of understanding the practical syllogism *does* do good job of providing a plausible explanation of moral motivation (reasons one might act in some way) and moral behavior (reasons one acted that way). To paraphrase McDowell: "Explanations of judgments about what to do are explanations of actions."[@mcdowell1979virtue 342. Verbatim, he says: "The explanations, so far treated as explanations of judgments about what to do, are equally explanations of actions."] I can explain your behavior by understanding that you were concerned for your friend’s welfare and reached out to help. Likewise, you can explain your decision to help by assuring me that you are concerned for your friend’s welfare. For McDowell, the general structure of the practical syllogism is useful. He says “the rationality of virtue… is not demonstrable from an external standpoint.”[@mcdowell1979virtue 346]

21. **Virtue bears a special relation to knowledge**. It is a practical knowledge. McDowell just argues that virtue is knowledge. 
22. MacIntyre argues that virtue enables the success of traditions, which are knowledge-traditions, or rationalities. 
23. Foot argues that virtue is part-and-parcel of practical rationality. 
24. This explains the unity of moral virtues within itself.
25. It also explains the unity of moral and intellectual virtues to each other. 
26. **Objections**. There are objections to this account so far. They are three: elitism, egoism, and the "optional virtue" or hypothetical imperative objection. 
27. Each have responses.

## Virtue and Practical Reason

1. Practical reason has now emerged as a major theme. Human nature is to be potentially a practical, rational animal. And human excellence or virtue is to be a mature practical rational animal, to actuate that potentiality. We must now problemetize this concept and address worries in this vicinity. 
4. Besides giving an account of practical reason, we must resolve some objections. There are five or six. a. What is practical reason? The ability to resolve what to do. b. What is the relation of practical rationality to one's nature as an animal or organism?  Have we left organic nature behind? This is the irrelevance objection. c.  What is the relation between this practical rationality and morality? Have we ignored the "bad" parts of our organic nature? This is the Polyanna problem. d. Do we even have a nature? This is the "unnecessary" objection. e. Is practical reason *important*? Does it matter? Is it special, objective, or especially important? That is the "objectivity" worry. f. Is practical reason merely intersubjective or both intersubjective and objective? This is the tradition-relativism objection. g. Is rationality natural and is nature rational? That is the monism objection, or idealism objection. 
5. A satisfying solution would show how natural norms are intrinsically able to motivate us, pertain to our universal human nature, are intrinsically able to justify themselves to us, and intrinsically relate "first" and "second" nature. That is our task. 

##a. What is practical reason? 

5. **The definition of practical reason**. According to my account, practical reason is the human capacity for resolving generally how to live and specifically what to do, and for reflecting on action, and evaluating good and bad. Practical reason is the capacity for thinking about *practical reasons*, that is, reasons to φ or not to φ. 
6. 2. The phrase 'moral reasons' is ambiguous: In one sense, moral reasons (i.e., facts about what is good for others) are simply one type of practical reason; but in another sense, *any* practical reason (i.e., objective normative and evaluative facts about what is worth pursuing and worth avoiding) are "moral reasons".
3. Practical reasons can and do sometimes motivate us, even absent other psychological phenomena such as desires, endorsements, or plans. 

b. What is the relation of practical rationality to one's nature as an animal or organism?  Have we left organic nature behind? This is the irrelevance objection. 

## Irrelevance Objection 
6. 8. Another might object that generics about human nature or the human life-form is not ethically relevant, since one is able, by virtue of rationality, to transcend one's nature. The practical point of view is not "scientific", even if it is broadly "naturalistic."
d. The flip side of this is: do we even have a nature? This is the "unnecessary" objection. 
9. McDowell urges this point against "Thompsonian" and Footian naturalism. He thematizes the concept of 'nature' itself. 
10. For McDowell, nature consists of Lockean primary qualities, which are response-independent as well as dispositional properties which are response-dependent. "Values" are the latter sort. There is no such thing as "to-be-pursuedness" existing as a Lockean primary quality in first nature. Nevertheless, values are not merely subjective fantasy. They are intersubjective, grounded in a form of life, grounded in our rationality itself. 
11. McDowell's view here is comprehensible in light of his broader project of anti-metaphysics, therapeutic philosophy, constructivism, and so on. 
12. The problems with McDowell's view are these: (1) McDowell's concept of nature is incoherent. It is both restricted and unrestricted. My view is superior in explicitly adopting an unrestricted conception and paying the conceptual price. (2) McDowell's concept of science is too crassly restrictive; although he disputes the "philistene scientism" of his opponents, he seems to me to endorse just enough philistene scientism to deserve his own criticism. He is a scietific realist on one page and anti-realist on another. And (3) there do seem to be primary qualities of nature such as "danger" and "safe" that are relational and actionable like moral qualities such as good and bad. McDowell's own example admits this but he shies away from the obvious conclusion.
13. It is *not* a problem that McDowell's view is a brand of idealism -- not a problem along naturalistic lines, since idealism can be naturalism, as Fink explains. 
9. The initial response to this objection is that some such properties are ethically relevant while some are not, and that it takes practical wisdom itself to recognize which ones are which. The scientific point of view is not the point of view *from within* the space of law but *about* the space of law *from within* the space of reasons. 
10. (a) **Norms are relevant**.  


## Polyanna Problem
c.  What is the relation between this practical rationality and morality? Have we ignored the "bad" parts of our organic nature? This is the Polyanna problem. 


## The importance of practical reason
e. Is practical reason *important*? Does it matter? Is it special, objective, or especially important? That is the "objectivity" worry. 


## Tradition and intersubjectivity
f. Is practical reason merely intersubjective or both intersubjective and objective? This is the tradition-relativism objection. 


## Reason and Nature
g. Is rationality natural and is nature rational? That is the monism objection, or idealism objection. 


## Wisdom
