# Analytical Outline

## Virtue Criteria

1. The argument in brief is this: It is possible to express in generic propositions scientific knowledge about the life form and natural teleology of natural organisms. (Scientific realism). And Humans are natural organisms. (Naturalism) Therefore, it is possible to express in generic propositions scientific knowledge about the life form and natural teleology of human beings. (Ethical naturalism) 
2. Specifically, the argument is that (1) humans are practical rational animals. (2) As animals and practical reasoners, we can actuate our life form by growing mature and becoming wise. (3) Virtues are those qualities that constitute maturity and wisdom according to our life form. 
3. The first proposition that needs support is the premise that humans are natural organisms who are subject, as all organisms, to evaluation according to the patterns of natural normativity. 
4. In other words, evaluating a good human being requires identifying what is characteristic of the species in question. It requires identifying our life form, our nature, the archetype of a human being. The set of "characteristic" features of a human being -- the human life-form or nature -- is expressible in generics. 
5. It is possible to express in generic propositions scientific knowledge about the life form and natural teleology of human beings. 
4. Now, one might object that human nature is variability itself.  
5. Nevertheless, all humans are (a) animals and (b) practical and rational. 
11. Humans are alive, move, live, grow, reproduce, and die. They have a history, a nature, and a destiny. 
10. Humans *speak*. They talk, engage in symbol use in social contexts.
11. Humans *act*; that is, they are practical creatures, that self-determine, self-direct, and so on. 
12. Human's *think*; we use terms like 'reason' and ratio as abstractions to describe a set of capacities we notice in ourselves. For example, activities that get called 'rational' are activities such as to observe, perceive as, create, reflect, decide, determine, abstract, infer, explain, deduce, remember, predict, criticize, praise, blame, admonish, and so on. 
6. As a generic, the truth of this statement is compatible with variability since variability is a function of practical reason, which is universal. 
7. As a generic or formal truth, the truth of this proposition is compatible with humans failing to become practical or rational due to genetic defect, illness, injury, or injustice. 
6. And one might object that there is no human nature because "natures" belong to lower life forms but not humans. Such animal natures aim at reproduction, not flourishing. 
7. But that simply isn't so. We are rational animals to whom reproduction is obviously not our end. 
15. By the first hypothesis, we should expect this: The qualities of being a good animal, speaking, acting, and thinking well given one's lifeform are, those that from the point of view of the alien anthropologist (a) make one a human being (fully exemplifies the human-life form) (b) make a human being admired by his or her fellows; furthermore, within the moral point of view, (c) one would judge such qualities really admirable -- in other words, such qualities would line up with one's own pre-analytical intuitions about what qualities count as morally praiseworthy. 
16. As animals we are inherently mortal, biological, beings whose life consists of a process of maturation, homeostatic maturity, aging, and death. Human being as rational *animals* by nature need to breathe, eat, sleep, and stay warm, deal with the urgings of our sexual nature, and so on.
(1) Beneficial for
        (1a) admirable from the inside
        (1b) enabling the actuation of, and partly actuating, the life form as would be observable by the alien anthropologist
        (1c) enabling characteristic "functions" or activity, 
(2) Animals 
        (2a) mortal
        (2b) grow, mature, eat, drink, sleep, copulate, stay warm, and die
        (2c) given our chemical, embodied, physical, locational situation and embodiednes
(3) Practical -- agential, active, 
       (3a) acquirable
        (3b) corrective
        (3c) whole life
        (3d) deliberative
        (3e) goal-oriented or teleological
        (3f) self-determining
        (3g) taking our animal "givens" as reasons
(4) Rational 
        (4a) speakers, symbol users
        (4b) knowers
        (4c) self-reflective
        (4d) social
        (4e) traditional
17. The virtues would be human-specific tokens of natural goodness conforming to the type characterized above. 

## Virtue Content

1. The crtieria provided capture virtue as it appears in the neo-Aristotelians. Foot's account of virtue, McDowell's, and MacIntyre's. 
2. Virtues are good of a kind for creatures like us.
