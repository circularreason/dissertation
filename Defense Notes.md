## Introduction

- My goal in this dissertation was to explain why everyone has an obligation to become wise. 

- I started out writing about virtue in the Aristotelian tradition: for Aristotle, you know, there are both moral virtues and intellectual virtues since human beings have a complex psychology, both emotions and reason. Human virtue is the excellence of human nature. 
- The project quickly became about the metaethical negotiation between Philippa Foot and John McDowell on this question of what is 'natural.' 
- Foot basically represents a modern, updated version of Aristotle's view that she thinks is compatible with modern science. McDowell represents the opposing view, that modern science is somehow *incompatible* with Aristotle's view of virtue and nature. 
- So I asked myself whether someone could assume scientific naturalism to be true and still be a moral realist about traditional virtues like moderation and practical wisdom. 
- I think Foot answers that question in the affirmative: even on scientific naturalism, including a moderate scientific realism, human beings are what I call "practical, rational primates" -- my own formulation of the old phrase "rational animal". 
- We can describe human beings with generic statements, which are a special form of judgment unlike universal and particular judgments -- they are formal or generic. And generics are normative/descriptive. They give us fundamentally normative insights into natural norms. There are natural norms followed by all organisms, human beings included. So the natural human norms are norms of virtue and practical reason. That's how I argue that we can move from statements like: "I am a human being. Therefore, I ought to be wise." Acquiring virtue and wisdom is a process, of course. So I call the project "becoming what we are". We need time and effort and, frankly, wisdom to become what we are, to actualize our human life form. So that's what I trued to argue. 


## Generics

Generic statements are formal truths derivable in the normal way (empirical observation and generalization) or via more abstract methods. 

Without them, you can’t even distinguish living from non-living beings. (Thompson)

A norm is basically a law. 

## Natural Law

- The so-called new natural law theory or “new classical natural law theory” or (sometimes) the “Grisez-Finnis theory” is a late-twentieth-century intellectual development, though it has antecedents in the thought of mid-twentieth-century philosophers such as Elizabeth Anscombe. New natural law theory is closely associated with the thought and writings of the American Catholic theologian German Grisez and the Oxford legal philosopher John M. Finnis, as well as figures such as Robert P. George, Joseph M. Boyle Jr., and William E. May.

## Purposiveness

1. Kant thought organisms must be thought of by human beings in teleological terms. 
2. He attempted, in the “Dialectic of Teleological Judgment,” to reconcile this teleological conception of organisms with a mechanistic account of nature. These are described here in Section 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.
3.  Kant also characterizes “purposiveness” as the “lawfulness of the contingent as such” (FI VI, 217; see also FI VIII, 228, Introduction V, 184, and §76, 404).
4. Subjective/objective purposiveness, formal/material purposiveness, 
5. "This principle is, in the terminology of the Critique of Pure Reason, regulative rather than constitutive. We cannot assert that nature is, as a matter of objective fact, purposive for our cognitive faculties, but it is a condition of the exercise of reflecting judgment that we assume nature's purposiveness for our cognitive faculties."


A purpose is both cause and effect of itself: 

>What makes an organism qualify as a natural purpose is that it is “both cause and effect of itself” (§64, 371). Kant gives a preliminary explanation of this idea at §64 by calling attention to three respects in which an organism, such as a tree, stands in a causal relation to its own existence. First, in producing offspring which resemble it, a tree “produces itself as far as its species is concerned,” so that the species of the tree maintains itself in existence. Second, a tree preserves itself as an individual by taking in nourishment from outside and converting it into the kind of organic substance of which it, itself, is made. Third, and most important, the various parts of a tree mutually maintain one another in existence and hence maintain the whole tree in existence. For example, while the leaves are produced by the tree as a whole and depend on it for their growth and maintenance, they are in turn necessary for the growth and maintenance of the other parts of the tree, for example the trunk and roots. Kant also mentions a number of further phenomena illustrating the way in which an organism is “cause and effect” of itself, in particular the capacity of certain organisms to regenerate missing parts, and more generally the capacity of organisms to repair damage to themselves.


>Kant goes into more detail about the notion of a natural purpose in §65, where he specifies two conditions something must meet in order to be a natural purpose. The first, that the “parts are possible…only through their relation to the whole” (§65, 373), is a condition on something's being, not only a natural purpose, but a purpose tout court. It thus applies not only to living things but also to artifacts, such as watches, in which each part is there for the sake of its relation to the whole, and is thus in a sense there only on account of its relation to the whole. The second condition, which applies only to purposes which are natural, is that “the parts of the thing…are reciprocally cause and effect of their form” (ibid.). (This corresponds to the third of the features to which Kant drew our attention in the example of the tree at §64.) This condition is not met by artifacts, a point which Kant illustrates by appeal to the example of a watch, whose parts, unlike the parts of a plant or animal, do not produce one another or maintain one another in existence.


Ginsborg (2001) attempts to resolve the problem of coherence by appeal to a conception of purposiveness as normativity (see Section 3.1 above), arguing that organisms can be regarded as subject to normative standards without supposing that they were designed to accord with those standards
