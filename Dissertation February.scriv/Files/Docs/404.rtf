\f0\fs28 \cf0 It is no wonder that ancient Greek values like affections like patriotism, friendship, and family love are less regarded or less philosophically analyzed. For civic loyalty, love of friends, and love of one\'92s own family are *partial*, that is, *not impartial.* Bernard Williams underscores this point: the good person\'92s motivation to save one\'92s spouse from drowning is not an additional thought that \'93after all, it is permissible to help one\'92s spouses.\'94 The motivation to help is simply \'93this is my spouse!\'94 The same kind of partiality we associate with admirable people goes for friendship and national or civic loyalty. \'93This is my city, therefore I ought to defend it against unjust laws or marauding conquerers.\'94}
