\f0\fs20 \cf0 ### Emotivism ###\
\
What troubled him about emotivism in particular and modern metaethics in general was an assumption shared by emotivists, intuitionists, naturalists, and error theorists that moral terms are referential. He argued that this assumption is a mistake. By contrast, he concluded that the significance of moral judgments is that \'93they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.\'94[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre\'92s master\'92s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Instead of referring (or failing to refer) to a special 'moral property', all evaluative reasoning practical reasoning, reasoning what to do. Hence, there can be no adequate theory of ethics apart from a theory of (practical) rationality. A recurring them of MacIntyre's work is that moral reasoning is practical reasoning. That is, moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself.}
