            <Text>## Some themes ##

Contemporary virtue ethics is reviving. This dynamic process has produced a diversity of voices. There are lively controversies on the main stage as well as some fascinating sideshows. Though consensus around the answers is pending, a set of thematic questions have emerged: 

1. First and foremost, what exactly *is* virtue (and its opposite, vice)? There are many accounts of virtue. Are they compatible or are there some  that are more plausible? 
2. Since Aristotle's writings, virtues have often been thought to play a special role in giving the virtuous agent *happiness* (eudaimonia, flourishing, thriving, welfare, etc.).[Cf. @annas2011intelligent] But Bentham and Nietzsche, among others, mock this alleged role. Is there any inherent relation between virtue and happiness? If so, are virtues necessary for happiness (as Foot thinks) or necessary *and sufficient* for happiness (as McDowell thinks)? 
3. Several conceptions of virtue (following Aristotle) have set eudamonia as the “function” of humanity, its purpose or telos.s Does it make sense to speak of a *human function*? If so, just what is it? And how does it relate to our unique attributes, like higher rationality, self-awareness, and language?  @brown2008 accepts natural final causality but rejects eudaimonia, preferring to speak in Darwinian terms about our purpose as reproduction, while @hursthouse1999 speaks about four "characteristically human ends" including but not limited to reproduction. 
4. Relatedly, if virtue is sufficient for happiness, does that mean that the life lived in pursuit of virtues and avoidance of vices is a life of shameless egoism?[Cf. @annas2009; @huang2010self] 
5. Another traditional notion defines virtues as those traits by which one becomes *fully human* or actualizes human nature. (Human nature is something like a set of properties or capacities common to all humans -- at least all non-defective humans. Human nature has been thought to include such essential properties as practical rationality, or rationality in general, language, social consciousness, self-consciousness, or genetic and other environmental/cultural properties.) Talk of a fixed "human nature" implies that an agent's humanity is in one sense a *given* to be discovered, while in another sense it is a goal to be achieved. One of the most persistent and widespread objections to this conception of virtue is that it seems to depend on a discredited Aristotelian metaphysical picture of human nature.
6. Even if we could expound and defend a realistic concept of human nature, would basing ethical conclusions on metaphysical or psychological premises commit Moore’s so-called "naturalistic fallacy"? How do we proceed from a premise about *the way human nature is* to any specific normative conclusions such as *humans ought to keep their promises*?
7. Furthermore, there are skeptical worries to the effect that there are no habitual characteristics or acquired traits such as virtues and vices are supposed to be.[@harman2009skepticism] Do virtues and vices qua stable character traits even exist? Or if they exist, do they matter enough to make theorizing about virtue even interesting?[@kamtekar2004situationism]
8. There is a growing body of literature on the theme of intellectual (rather than merely moral) virtues.[Cf. @zagzebski1996virtues;  @bloomfield2000virtue] Some think practical wisdom (or phronesis) is one virtue among many, while others think it the master virtue that unifies both practical and intellectual. Are all virtues practical or are some intellectual? 
9. One worry about virtue ethics that does not carry the same bite for the deontologist is so called problem of moral luck. The problem, roughly, is that if virtues like generosity depend on having wealth, the unfortunate and unlucky are excluded from moral virtue by non-moral facts. Is this a genuine problem? If so, what solutions are available? 
10. Finally, there are more abstract or foundational questions such as how (if at all) might virtue virtue theorists have unique resources for defending a claim to objective moral knowledge? And what does ‘objective’ mean?[@sellars1927naturalism. I have been helped in the clarification of this term by an old but extremely perspicuous article by Roy Sellars, the father of Wilfred Sellars.]

The four key virtue ethicists listed above address some or all of these questions. Since our focus must be limited somehow, I try to remain attentive to the primary themes of my project while commenting briefly or at least acknowledging some of the key general questions that interest virtue ethicists. 

The four key virtue ethicists listed above address some or all of these questions. For each writer, I shall remaining sensitive to their particular project, while keeping an eye on some or all of these thematic questions.  My governing questions are: first, how does each philosopher conceive of virtue — and what are the implications of that conception? Second, how does he or she defend that conception against a battery of objections? Thirdly, what valuable insights can we cull from their accounts? My goal is that this work lays the foundation for future work on the ethics and foundations of virtue. </Text>

            <Title>### Why these five? </Title>
            <Text>## Why these five? ##

A second question we should ask and answer up front: Why these five? Certainly, these five authors are an excellent starting point, since they have each in their own way contributed to the revival of virtue ethics. But I would like to more specifically discuss why I select these five writers. 

There are many important and influential philosophers who have written on virtue ethics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: any list of "big names" would have to include Peter Geach,[@geach1977virtues] Elizabeth Anscombe,[@anscombe1958; @anscombe1957intention] Iris Murdoch,[@murdoch2013sovereignty] Martha Nussbaum,[@nussbaum1995;  @nussbaum1988non] Judith Thomson, Julia Annas,[@annas2011intelligent] Michael Thompson, Christine Swanton,[@swanton2003virtue] Michael Slote,[@slote1992morality] and Paul Bloomfield[@bloomfield2003moral], among others. And certainly, one could construct a worthwhile project approaching some or all of these authors. 

First, I select them partly because I find them the most interesting and sympathetic to my own views. Secondly, I am convinced that focusing on these five authors will provide an interesting and fruitful plan of research for years to come. Most of them are already in extended conversation with each other. For example, there are clear lines of influence from Anscombe to all these writers; from MacIntyre to Hursthouse; from Foot to McDowell, and so on. Yet for all these converging lines, there are many divergent ones. These five represent a fascinating diversity of views. Highlighting overlapping points and contrasting divergent ones promises an opportunity for illuminating connections and deeper insights into the theory of each author. 

Thirdly, each of these philosophers is similarly ambitious in presenting coherent yet wide-ranging theories sensitive both to normative ethical questions about virtue, happiness, goodness, human well-being, etc., and also to the foundations of virtue in moral epistemology, moral metaphysics, moral psychology, etc. MacIntyre, Hursthouse, Foot, McDowell, and Adams each present the ethical *and* metaethical aspects of their theories as an organic whole. This ambitious kind of project Stephen Darwall simply calls "philosophical ethics”.[@darwall2003should]  

## Neo-Aristotelian Virtue Ethics? ##

I would like to explore one further reason for studying just these five virtue ethicists together. Stating this reason requires taking a bit of a detour. I think the detour will address (if not diffuse) a potential worry about the relation between normative ethics and metaethics. 

In recognition of their approach to philosophical ethics, most of these virtue ethicists are also classified as "neo-Aristotelians" with respect to metaethics. There are two important metaphilosophical confusions lurking behind these innocuous distinctions. 

To begin to see the confusions, consider the way James Lenman summarizes neo-Aristotelianism as a version of "moral naturalism":

&gt;One important school of thought ... [is] work is inspired by that of Aristotle. This view has its roots in the writings of G. E. M. Anscombe, P. T. Geach and the early Philippa Foot among others. Its contemporary representatives include the later Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum and Judith Jarvis Thomson. As this list makes clear, this is very much the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics. [@sepmoralnaturalism. Lenman acknowledges that Thomson might need to be subtracted from this list and that John McDowell might need to be added.]

Lenman does not quite know what to do with neo-Aristotelian naturalism. The first confusing fact is the close tie between neo-Aristotelian naturalism and virtue theory.  Lenman seems bemused when he says that neo-Aristotelianism "the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics."  For when Foot, Hursthouse, McDowell are classified as virtue ethicists (a normative theory) *and* neo-Aristotelians (a metaethical theory), we might object.  Aren't these two different projects? One legacy of G.E. Moore's *Principia Ethica* has been the tendency to sharply distinguish primary ethical questions (about what things are good) from metaethical questions (about what 'good' as an evaluative predicate *means*). 

The second is an uncertainty with respect to who actually deserves the title of "naturalists". Lenman is not sure who counts, pointing out in a footnote that Thomson probably shouldn't be on this list and that John McDowell probably should. He says "McDowell is certainly pervasively inspired by Aristotle and he describes himself as a naturalist. See especially his 1995. But I suspect many philosophers would find his use of the term  'naturalist' here somewhat Pickwickian."[@sepmoralnaturalism]  The confusion arises because Lenman and others[@rehg2003conceptual; @hacker2009natural; @hacker2009human] are not sure that neo-Aristotelian "naturalism" is "really *naturalism*" at all. 

Both of these confusions reflect deep fault lines in contemporary philosophical ethics. In brief, the fault line separates two contrary ways of understanding what *nature* is. Put differently, the fault line separates two ways of understanding the fact/value dichotomy.[@putnam2002collapse] 

Aristotle and the broad Aristotelian tradition deny that the fact-value dichotomy is absolute. They conceive of *nature* as including everything that *is and ought to be.* Briefly, for Moore nature as including everything that *is* but not what ought to be -- all facts, no values. Moore and those influenced by him, both naturalists and non-naturalists, have agreed with the underlying assumption that "nature" is purely descriptive. But what if this assumption is mistaken? Surely we cannot let a deeply-held assumption stand without scrutiny. For Aristotle, nature is some facts, some values. So norms and prescriptions can be just as natural as facts and descriptions. If normativity (*what ought to be*) is natural too, then it might be possible that *human nature* grounds ethical facts. And this is just what virtue ethics says. 

The two questions above (about whether neo-Aristotelians are truly "naturalists" and the close tie between neo-Aristotelian metaethics and normative virtue ethics) have the same answer: Aristotle's ethics and his metaphysics (of biology and nature) cannot be easily extricated from each other. The same goes for neo-Aristotelians. There is a tight fit -- perhaps an inextricable tie -- between Aristotelian virtue theory and the metaethical view labeled neo-Aristotelian naturalism. And neo-Aristotelian naturalists argue that nature is or can be normative. Talking as if the fact-value dichotomy is *not* ultimate makes the other sort of naturalist squirm.

Now, non-Aristotelians might just double down and insist that metaethical theory is utterly procedural and not substantive -- they might insist that it is utterly neutral with respect to normative ethical theories. Certainly this is the most widespread belief. 

Nevertheless, two responses are possible: first, we might seriously doubt this alleged neutrality. For example, we might notice the conspicuous connection between supposedly "neutral" metaethics and first-order consequentialism: G.E. Moore, J.L. Mackie, Frank Jackson, Richard Boyd, Peter Railton, Simon Blackburn, and Alan Gibbard all endorse consequentialism. (We might even echo Lenman and call moral naturalism the "official theory of a main current in contemporary consequentialism.") 

Secondly, even if a procedural, non-substantive approach to metaethics can be made neutral with respect to normative ethics, it is still admirably ambitious to construct a theory that pays attention to both. Darwall agrees. His (2003) essay summarizes the history of analytic ethics since Moore, and persuasively argues "that although metaethics and normative ethics are properly focused on different issues, they need to be brought into dynamic relation with one another in order to produce a systematic and defensible philosophical ethics. This mutual dependence is owing to the fact that issues of normativity are at the center of the concerns of both metaethics and normative ethics."[@darwall2003should] I might add that issues of normativity *and nature* are at the center of concerns about both. 

These are deep waters. Suffice it to say, for now, that I think Darwall is right here: Moore's legacy is not the last word on the relation between the semantic and metaphysical foundations of moral terms and concepts and the substantive normative questions. And these five tend to agree. Foot and MacIntyre, for instance, begin their books by criticizing Moore for his erroneous starting points. They may all be wrong, but they are on a page together. 

 And that is one of the major reasons for selecting these five for dissertation-length study. They are sure to provide excellent fodder for study in their own right, and also provide a gateway into further research and writing on some of these deeper relations between disenchanted nature and "re-enchanted" nature, between and virtue, between humanity and human excellence.</Text>

"Buhler has written an important contribution to metaethics. And an impressive analysis of both metaphysical and normative ethical issues in the ongoing discussion of naturalism." John Smith, University of Iowa

"When people ask me what naturalism is, I no longer point them to David Papieneau now, but the introductory chapters of Buhler's book. It resoundingly refutes a few nonsensical positions, clarifies a few sensible ones, and highlights the most reasonable." 

"Moral realism's fire is burning hot, and dealers book helps us to see that this is not A flash in the pan. Moral realism especially combined with virtue theory, is the most powerful! We have of the world we live in, the people we admire, and the people we aspire to be." Scott Smith

"A pugnacious and tightly argued cogent case for metaethical realism, sensitive to the historical context of these long-standing debates, but dancing circles around the faulty presuppositions of contemporary thinkers."

"A book of resounding philosophical common sense bristling with persuasive arguments and adorned with, I dare say, wisdom."</Text>

            <Text>Murphy, Mark C. God and moral law: On the theistic explanation of morality. Oxford University Press, 2011.


Mark Murphy's book is a first‐rate discussion of the relationship between God and the moral law. It is clear and analytically rigorous, and breaks new ground especially in its criticism of leading views like natural law theory and theological voluntarism. There is also much that should be of interest to non‐theists, including an extensive discussion of laws of nature. I will briefly summarise the book's six chapters before offering some general observations.
Chapter 1 contains a detailed discussion of moral laws. Drawing on recent work on laws of nature, Murphy assesses various accounts of moral laws such as the law that one ought to help the undeservedly suffering (p. 18). Numerous problems are raised for attempts to understand such laws as mere universal generalisations or as statements of regularities forming a deductive system. Instead Murphy relies heavily on the Armstrong/Dretske/Tooley approach to laws of nature, where (roughly) there is a necessitation relation between universals such that one universal ‘selects’ another. In the moral case, what necessitates are non‐moral features of (say) an action, and what is necessitated is either performing or not performing the action. To use Murphy's example, being the object of one's valid promise morally necessitates being performed (p. 36).
Chapter 2 relates moral laws to moral facts, and also introduces the kind of explanatory account of moral laws that should be expected from a theistic perspective. Moral facts are of the general form, it is morally necessary for A to φ (p. 46). Murphy argues …

# Analytical Precis of (Dissertation Title) #

## Introduction ##
1. The thesis of this dissertation is... 
2. My methodology is fundamentally MacIntyrean. 
3. Virtue ethics is on the rise; I want to contribute to this revival. 
4. Some themes are settled but many theses are still up for grabs. 
5. Some big recurring questions pertain to the definition of virtue, and its relation to φρονεσις or practical wisdom (practical rationality, prudence, etc.)
6. Some secondary questions pertain to human nature, the naturalistic fallacy, worries about the psychological reality of virtues, the distinction between intellectual and moral (or theoretical/practical) virtues, and the objectivity or "bindingness" of morality. 
6. This dissertation explores five virtue ethicists and their take on these main themes, as well as some secondary ones. 
5. This thesis explores "neo-Aristotelian" virtue ethicists, rather than many of the new, interesting, outlier brands. 
7. The neo-Aristotelians are interesting to me.  
8. The neo-Aristotelians are united in denying that metaethics and ethics can ultimately be divorced and treated independently. 
8. I'll treat each one on his or her own terms, but try to note harmony and discuss dissonance as they emerge. 
9. For example, one common theme that will arise each is teleology, that is, end-directed or seemingly end-directed behavior of agents, organs, animals, systems, or the cosmos as a whole. So there is recurring discussion of "function", or telos, or purpose, or end, as it relates to form, or structure, or configuration. 
10. Another theme relating to practical reason is one of the great themes of western philosophy: the relation or distinction between rationality and practical rationality, mind and will, reason and choice, etc. 
8. The dissertation has six main chapters: one for each thinker and a conclusion. 

## Chapter 1: MacIntyre  ##
1. MacIntyre is influential. 
2. MacIntyre treats ethical inquiry as a species of rational inquiry. 
3. MacIntyre is a severe critic of modernity (labelled Enlightenment, liberalism, etc.). 
4. Enlightenment modernity is bankrupt not only morally, but politically and socially as well; but especially our ethics.
5. The primary failure of the Enlightenment was the excisement of teleology from reality, human nature, human life, and human practice. 
3. Rationality is constituted by traditions (and constitutes them). 
4. Hence, practical rationality is constituted by a tradition.
5. Traditions are socially embedded arguments over time, rooted in source text, with authorities, and argumenst inside and outside the tradition.
5. What is good to do, what is a good life, are indexed to traditions, the notion of human life, and practices.
6. Practices are complex social activities with common goals, common standards, and the possibility of excellence in achieving those goals within those standards. 
7. Life is a continuous practice or serious of practices in pursuit of a socially-defined good. 
8. Virtues enable success in practices, and enable a flourishing life for persons and communities, and sustain traditions. 
9. Virtue has three layers or dimensions: practices, social institutions, and human life as a whole (within that tradition). 
10. The telos of life is (minimally) to be free to pursue one's telos; it is (maximally) to discover more adequately one's telos. 
11. Virtues enable the achievement of telos, to *know how to live*.
10. Humans are by nature practical reasoners. 
11. Humans are vulnerable and need virtues of dependence as well as "greatness" or magnanimity. 
12. Virtuous communities successful educate their young to become independent practical reasoners who *know* what to do, know what is good, and pursue it, further defining and clarifying what is good. 
13. Some object that MacIntyre vascillates on his definition of virtue.
14. But the practice-relative virtues are relative to traditions and can be judged as a whole.
13. Some object that MacIntyre is a relativist -- there is no "tradition" to ethics and morality.
14. But he argues that traditions can be tested against one another through philosophical imagination; and my own tradition can be tested by my own standards. 
14. Some object that MacIntyre is not relativistic enough -- there is simply no "rationality" to ethics and morality. 
15. MacIntyre argues that reason *begins* in time, place, social context, language, but is not ultimately a slave to these limits; it can transcend them to achieve something like the Enlightenment ideal of universal reason. Traditions can get along, and emotivism, nihilism, are disastrous for human life. 
16. Some (especially the Encyclopediasts) object that ethics can get on well enough without teleology. 
17. The true abandonment of natural and social teleology leads to moral nihilism; the rules without any point. 
18. Most moral theorists (and biologists, psychologists, etc.) do not really abandon teleology except in name. 
19. MacIntyre's critiques are wide-ranging and cut deep; if they are true, much needs to change about university education and the way ethics and morality are studied and taught and practiced. 
20. Even those who disagree are invited to engage in philosophical imagination to examine his rival tradition and examine the flaws and inconsistencies of their own tradition. 

## Chapter 2: Foot ##
1. Philippa Foot is influential. 
2. Foot treats morality as a species of practical reason. 
3. Foot is a severe critic of G. E. Moore's conception that good can be a one place predicate; it is always *good for*. 
3. Virtues enable human beings to "get along well"; in this she agrees with Peter Geach. 
4. Virtues for humans are like stings for bees, swiftness for deer, solidarity for wolves; there is a fundamental parity between natural goodness in nonhumans and humans. 
4. Immorality can be answered.
5. Virtues benefit their possessor by definition; but they can cause harm and suffering.
6. Happiness is deep satisfaction.
7. Unhappiness is in some way compatible with virtue. 
8. Some object that Foot is not a "naturalist."
9. This is to misunderstand Foot and to beg the question as to what nature is. 
10. Some object that Foot is unclear across three levels: logic, language, and morality. 
11. This is somewhat true but drawing a clear distinction between the three need not suggest a sharp *division* between the three. 
12. Some object that Foot is not clear (James Lenman, for example). 
13. This is not true; she is clear enough to expose the readers' modern prejudices.

1. John McDowell is influential.

### My own views

One of the key technical terms we will learn from Alasdair MacIntyre is *tradition*. For MacIntyre, a tradition is a socially-embedded argument. Each of us is raised within a tradition. 

It is expedient, then, to come out with my own tradition. I speak from within the broad tradition of western civilization, which has argued since Plato over fundamental questions about goodness, reality, truth, beauty, and knowledge. I consider myself an Aristotelian, not in that I agree with every jot and tittle of his complete works, but in that I and many if not all westerners are descendants of the Greco-Roman culture that survives in Europe and America, and has in many respects spread to Asia, Africa, Russia, Australia and the world. 

But traditions are concentric; I am also an anglophone U. S. American from California. I count this as an exercise in American Ethics. Now, any philosophy that claims to be American must be in some way pragmatist. But method over doctrine doctrine means that the doctrines are fluid, flexible, in process, evolving. So those who resist my conclusions must either refute them or be branded enemies of progress. For a methodological naturalist who is consistent to deviate from the present orthodoxy is not a complaint but a necessary project demanded by present orthodoxy. Just as to be a single called organism is to cease being single called but become multi-celled, to be human is to become transhuman. 

I am a left-coast Californian and born-again Orthodox Christian. Only in the later chapters do I revisit some of these questions from the unique vantage point offered by the Christian narrative, which is just the vantage point offered by seeing all of Christ’s creation (especially ourselves) in light of Christ. In this and in the subsequent chapters leading up to that final one, I restrict myself to the Aristotelian tradition. Firstly, I wish to seek common ground with my atheist, rationalist, or humanist readers who share with me not a common faith but a common civilization. Secondly, I wish to find out as much about nature and human nature by the light of reason, philosophical reflection on experience, and empirical study.

I count this as an exercise in Greco-Roman-Euro-American philosophy.


### Audience

My audience are not merely those who (like me) trust, admire, worship and obey Jesus. My audiences are those who admire but do not worship, who trust but do not obey.  These might be agnostic, spiritual but not religious, or atheistic. But I do not presume atheism in this work. I presume that all evidences, physical, psychological and social are on the table. All experience and all science and all reason are for me sources, but no revelation other than the revelation of reason.

I hope in future work to explore those questions of especial interest to us who have more resources available to answering them, like Alvin Plantinga and Robert Adams.

### A double danger

My goal is not to write from within my tradition as a theist and indeed a Christian. The resources available for thinking about virtue are much greater. Rather, if the church to which I belong is a citadel on the hill, and the broader western tradition is a city spread out like a wheel on the surrounding terrain, my goal is to leave the citadel and see how much work can be done in the city. Outside the city, of course, are the villages, towns, and countryside homes. And beyond that, wilderness. I shall not have much to say to the wild men who are utter moral strangers. 

The double danger of limiting myself to what can be said about virtue and nature from within a public and secular tradition is that both audiences are liable to misunderstand me: fellow theists or fellow Christians in particular may assume that I ignore the extra resources available to me out of disbelief or ignorance; fellow westerners who do belong or might belong to the tradition of Aristotle will assume that I consider the more narrow domain of secular discourse as a means of proselytizing for my faith, inching towards God. Both sides may think me either disingenuous or misguided. This is a danger that can be mitigated by explicit avowals of my true intentions. But such misunderstandings cannot be wholly guarded against. I think the reward is worth the risk. To detail neo-Aristotelianism and to give a novel account of naturalism that both theists and atheists or agnostics can consider, modify, and in part accept, is worth all the trouble. 

### The amoralist objection

My tradition accepts that it is good to be good and that we have a rational obligation to become virtuous. My tradition also generates an impressive list of virtues and a cohesive account of their relation and ultimate foundation. I do not pretend that this dissertation gives an account adequate to the task of *persuading* an amoralist, a moral skeptic, or moral nihilist. Then again, I’m not sure *any* account of morality could do that task. Plato’s *Republic*[@plato Republic, 621c] is devoted to (among many other things!) answering Glaucon’s hypothetical question: is virtue for its possessor better than vice? Why be virtuous? Is there *any* reason to be virtuous, excluding the admittedly external, contingent, or social benefits that accrue to the person who *appears* virtuous — such as honor, respect, position, friendship, etc. Yet even that book ends ambiguously with Socrates urging a *story* that “could save us, if we are persuaded by it”; as for Glaucon’s response… we hear only silence. Is he persuaded? Asleep? Still hesitant? Plato leaves us questioning. 

Foot *will* attempt to address the Nietzschean immoralist. Not being hungry for such an answer myself, I cannot judge whether it would satisfy someone genuinely undecided as to whether or not being being good is a good idea. 

My goal rather is to *clarify* and *elucidate* the tradition in which I find myself. This will mainly be of interest to fellow adherents of the tradition (broadly) of virtues. But it will be of interest to others in related or rival traditions. 

My position within my tradition renders impossible two goals — goals that are otherwise fine and admirable goals for someone to aim for. The first is the goal of persuading the amoralist. I leave that for others more worthy to the task.[@superson2009moral] The second is the goal of persuading the adherent of a rival tradition. Though MacIntyre occupies the center stage of only one chapter, the entire dissertation is undertaken in a *MacIntyrean* spirit. The best a member of a rival tradition can hope is for an “as if” account — a clear account that can serve the philosophical imagination of one who *already wants* to learn a “second-language” of another moral tradition.

            <Text>### Narrative Self ###

The start of MacIntyre's account is the definition of virtue strictly in terms of practices. And practices are activities individual persons undertake. But practices are themselves inherently social. They are undertaken by individuals but they are not individualistic. 

The second stage of the account expands its scope to include the social dimension of virtue more explicitly. Practices are already understood as social activities. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices ennervate and eventually ruin them. So virtue and vice already have a social character in the first stage. But the second stage makes the social factor more explicit and deepens it. 

### Enlightenment Self ### 

What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast so well I shall quote them almost in full: 

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a telos, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific telos brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a telos external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. They celebrate the empty self's elimination of these strictures as an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

### Real Self ###

The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self. MacIntyre here argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] 

Three considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

A discussion of teleology I defer until the next section.  
 
If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

MacIntyre explains the relationship between virtue, practices, and institutions like this: 

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]</Text>

            <Title>Macintyre - flexible standards</Title>
            <Text>As I see it, virtue defined by practice can already be significantly contrasted against mere *happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. On the one hand, the standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal formal laws. They are “contentful,” immanent, flexible standards. On the other hand, the standards by which practitioners judge each other are not all “external” ; they are not merely an arbitrary set of social conventions. Farmers cannot get together and decide farming is no longer about husbandry but is about selling land along highways for billboard advertisements. The practice itself, with its history and its aims, has a structure that is persists across generations and flexes, but does not break, with varying standards. That structure is passed along, modified, but modified according to an inner logic. 

Many have agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe’s characterization of consequentialism more generally that it views all consequences merely contingent goods. Such a view reduces all goods (except happiness itself) as goods of effectiveness. She puts the point in this way: 

&gt;Now the consequentialist has no footing on which to say "This would be permissible, this not"; because by his own hypothesis, it is the consequences that are to decide, and he has no business to pretend that he can lay it down what possible twists a man could give doing this or that; the most he can say is: a man must not bring about this or that; he has no right to say he will, in an actual case, bring about such-and-such unless he does so-and-so.[@anscombe1958 13] 

I shall return to this discussion of such contingent goods in the discussion of teleology below.



#### Aristotle's account
We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes.[^7] Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaimonia. (D) The *telos* of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaimonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

[^7]: A few paraphrases may help: the the formal cause of an object is sometimes called its "structure" or "configurational state"; final cause the "function". 


### Worry about relativism ###

He has already put practices into a broader teleological context wherein life *as a whole* can be virtuous. He does say that the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] But integrity is a necessary, not sufficient, condition. Even putting human life into a unified, integrated narrative does not definitively solve the problem of relativism. For we still might worry: is there a single *telos* for human life? Is there a unity to all the virtues such that “wicked virtues” can be excluded? And if so, is it rooted in our “metaphysical biology” as Aristotle thought? To avoid relativism, he must justify the assumption that virtues are not neutral with respect to ends, but are actually *good* for their possessor.  


### Concluding remarks ###


For example, MacIntyre's theory can answer the worry about relativism discussed above. Yet for some critics the worry still clings. I would suggest that full resolution of the criticism can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves. MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the enquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the enquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that enquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the enquiry. 

It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side "just isn’t doing philosophy anymore." My only point here is that *which side that is* is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal philosophers that Thomistic “philosophy” isn’t philosophy at all.[@lutz2004tradition chapter 5.] It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian-type philosophers that modern secular “philosophy” isn’t philosophy at all. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

A second concluding remark is my tentative suggestion as to MacIntyre's legacy. One feature we might observe about great thinkers — Plato, Aquinas, Kant, and a dozen of others — is that they present a totalizing theory that explains many phenomena but also explains why critics criticize. Great thinkers present not only philosophical solutions to philosophical problems, but a definition or understanding of philosophy itself. They are always philosophers *and* metaphilosophers. This feature satisfies their followers and frustrates their critics. For to criticize such a thinker feels like falling into a well-laid trap. One of the signs, I believe, of MacIntyre’s greatness is just this feature. He presents not only isolated theories but a theoretical system in which critics, depending on their criticism, receive a name, a number, a category, a classification, and a designated response. Adherents, too, are accommodated. But to criticize MacIntyre is much trickier business than one might suspect at first. Critics find themselves dipping into one of many already well-poisoned wells, and falling into pre-laid traps. 



### Swift line for footnote? ###

Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted at being considered a giant in Lilliput but a midget in Brobdingnag;[@swift1965gulliver Part I, chapter 2 and Part II, chapter 1] the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is criticised for excessive rationalism by his co-religionists[@milbank2008theology] and for excessive religiosity by rationalists[@nussbaum1989recoiling]; he too progressive for traditionalists and too traditional for progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. To quote Swift: "Philosophers are in the right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise than by Comparison."

In his 1994 book The Moral Problem, Smith argues that moral arguments are a species of rational arguments.

            <Title>### Human Virtue and the charge of relativism ### </Title>
            <Text>### The charge of relativism ###

Thus far we have said that virtues are acquired qualities that enable individuals to achieve the internal goods of practices and we have said that the self is a social (not empty) self. 

One worry that many readers have had is that MacIntyre’s virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a practice? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. But MacIntyre denies being a relativist[@macintyre1984after xii-xiii in the 25th anniversary edition]. 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third stage. He admits that there might be evil practices. We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil. If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. 

To avoid relativism, he must add a third layer or dimension to his account of virtue. So the account must do justice to the assumption that virtues are good for their possessor. 

### Human virtue ### 

The third level, then, is the broadest — that of humanity. Individuals and societies or social groups do not share much (anything?) but what we are as biological and psychological creatures. MacIntyre admits that defining virtues in terms of practices necessitates questioning whether life as a whole can be virtuous — the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition. So, from this broadest view, even practices and institutions can be judged by how well they accord with our overall purpose, our overall life, and our overall nature. Here we can see the closest attachment to Aristotle's original sense of 'virtue'.

### Institutions ### 

Now, practices are distinct from (but related to) institutions or traditions. For example, a university is an institution defined by a set of practices in which professors and students engage. Thomism a tradition defined by a set of arguments playing out over time embedded in a social community.

### Concentric Circles ### 

### Tradition and Rationality ###

What is a tradition exactly?  

&gt;A tradition is an argument extended through time in which certain fundamental agreements are defined and redefined in terms of two kinds of conflicts: those with critics and enemies external to the tradition who reject all or at least key parts of those fundamental agreements, and those internal interpretative debates through which the meaning and rationale of the fundamental agreements come to be expressed and by whose progress a tradition is constituted.[@macintyre1988whose 12]

Weinstein summarizes a tradition as “a living debate.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 64] As examples, MacIntyre offers the Aristotelian tradition, the Christian tradition, and the modern liberal tradition. Each has a “source text”, a community in fundamental agreement with the (orthodox reading of the) source text, arguments between interpreters concerning the “meaning and rationale” of those fundamental agreements, and argument between those within the community and those outside. Each tradition has authorities or experts who safeguard and propagate the core beliefs on which there is agreement. 

Traditions are the social and intellectual contexts from which agreed-upon beliefs emerge. More importantly, traditions are the context in which *standards of rationality* itself emerges. There may be, and are, competing and incommensurable definitions of rationality itself. People within a tradition can disagree about a conclusion (should taxes be raised on the wealth?) but agree about the means of adjudication (let’s debate, hold a vote, run economic analyses, etc.). People across traditions can disagree about a conclusion (should women wear face coverings?) *and* disagree about the means of adjudication (let’s consult the Qu’ran, let’s debate, let’s let each woman decide for herself).

Rationality for MacIntyre does not have any special, Enlightenment-friendly, technical meaning. Rationality is rather name for the whole process of judging truth and falsity *including* all the resources for judging truth and falsity. A particular understanding of rationality *includes* the procedural reasoning *and* "facts", the "objective facts", etc. about which we reason. 

Traditions can, by their own standards, fail. Inevitably rival traditions will judge each other as failures by alien standards; it is not interesting to note that *their* tradition fails by *my* standards, or vice versa. What is interesting is when *my* tradition fails *by my own* standards.

Traditions, like scientific paradigms, as we noted briefly above, change through crisis. Traditions function throughout a generation and regenerate across generations. Most of the assumptions are “unarticulated pre-suppositions which are themselves never the objects of attention and enquiry.”[@macintyre1988dependent] This self-propagation proceeds until (internal) interpretive challenges or (external) criticism bring the swelling conflicts to a crisis point. After this, the members of the tradition either split and form a new sub-tradition or else consensually take one of a limited set of possible courses, including reformation, conservation, and growth. 

Traditions can grow and be systematically improved by any non-fatal crises brought up by internal provocateurs and external critics.[@weinstein2003macintyre 67] Anything that does not kill a tradition makes it stronger. But some crises are fatal. An “epistemological crisis” is when “hitherto trusted methods of enquiry have become sterile… conflicts over rival answers to key questions can no longer be settled rationally.”[@macintyre1988 361]

So, we must imagine a three ring circle. At the center are practices; the middle ring is the narrative conception of human life, including a presumed telos; the outer ring is the tradition or culture. Weinstein summarizes:

&gt;These contain internal goods that drive the development of a story of justification which people use to develop a conception of a human *telos* that is itself the center and driving force behind a tradition, they form a *cultural* narrative. Children are born into this tradition, and they look toward these stories to justify their participation in the culture practices.[@weinstein2003macintyre 65]

### How many traditions are there? ###

In *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry*[@macintyre1990three] MacIntyre calls modernity a tradition unto itself. Its source texts include Hume’s *Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*, its authorities, arguments include the debate between empiricism and rationalism, arguments within philosophy of science over the proper scope and method of natural sciences, arguments between Christianity and atheism, etc. Its external critics include non-western (and non-colonial) cultures or non-Enlightenment cultures. 

The three main *types* of traditions we have already alluded to. Genealogy, encyclopedia, and tradition. Each of these are characterized by its attitude toward the past. 
&gt;The encyclopaedists’ narrative reduces the past to a mere prologue of the rational present, while the genealogist struggles in the construction of his or her narrative against the past, included that of the past which is perceived as hidden within the alleged rationality of the present. The Thomists’ narrative, by contrast with both of these, treats the past neither as a mere prologue nor as something to be struggled against, but as that from which we have to learn if we are to identify and move towards our *telos* more adequately and that which we have to put to the question if we are to know which questions we ourselves should next formulas and attempt to answer, both theoretically and practically.[@macintyre1990three 79]

Thomism is, I take it, only one tradition within the general type of Tradition. But the point is that enlightenment modernity is the “tradition” of encyclopedias, the “traditionless-tradition.” To put the picture in a caricature, each successive generation denies the validity of all previous generations.

            <Text>Core thesis
This dissertation defends the claim that neo-Aristotelianism is the most adequate theory of ethics because it is the most likely true, the most useful for living well, and satisfies all non-trivial criteria for a coherent naturalism. 


Moral realism
I treat moral realism as a “defeasible presumption” and defend the presumption against only a few of its bitterest objections. Among realist theories of value, neo-Aristotelians can explain what needs explaining — our ubiquitous evaluative thought and talk — better than any other consequentialism, functionalism, physicalism, or what have you. But before neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics can win the day as the theory for even orthodox naturalists, its naturalistic “credentials” must be made clear. I began by assuming naturalism to be true and questioning whether neo-Aristotelianism was sufficiently naturalistic. Now, though, I no longer find the question meaningful unless clarified. ‘Natural’ when clarified either means reductively physical or material, atheistic, useful, or true, so the question of naturalism is really four: is neo-Aristotelianism compatible with reductive physicalism? Atheism? Is it useful? Is it true? The answers are no, yes, yes, and yes. 

What are we trying to explain?
To make the case for my main thesis that neo-Aristotelianism is our best bet metaethically speaking, I must  explain why it is such a plausible primary ethical theory and then defend it as a metaethical theory. To do the first, I must gather samples of what is puzzling about our ethical and normative lives, and show neo-Aristotelianism as an excellent explanation thereof, far superior to to its rivals. To do the second, I must explore the nature and definition of naturalism. 

Ethical naturalism and nihilism
Now, ethical naturalism is commonly taken to be a family of cognitivist moral realist views. Without the academese: values are real but belong not some supernatural or platonic realm but to nature. But ethical naturalism is also taken less commonly but I think truly to be the family of ethical theories compatible with naturalism, including some moral realisms but also non-cognitivism, error theory, expressionism. The latter group I will treat under the pejorative label of ‘nihilism.’ I take ethical nihilism to be false and disastrously so, but a helpful heuristic. If a view can be shown to amount to nihilism, then it can be shown to reduce to absurdity. The upshot is that not all ‘naturalisms’ are created equal. Or so I shall argue. 

Options
In explaining the many phenomena of our dappled normative discourse, we have a taxonomy of philosophical options. The first cut is between realism and anti-realism (or irrealism, or nihilism). I will argue that realism is a defeasible presumption. 
The second cut is between naturalism and non-naturalism (or anti-naturalism). I will not argue against non-naturalism but merely assume naturalism because that is my research hypothesis. 
The third cut is between ethical naturalisms. There are many, but the main options I consider are: strict or reductive naturalism (i.e., physicalism like that of Frank Jackson’s), and relaxed naturalism.  I shall argue against reductive naturalism.  
The fourth cut is between varieties of relaxed naturalism: a sort of rationalistic quietism of Thomas Nagel, the scientific consequentialism of Richard Boyd and the Cornell Realists, the neo-Aristotelianism of Philippa Foot. I shall argue against quietism, and consequentialism.

Relation of ethics to metaethics?
Having chosen neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics as our metaethical option, we must explore it as a primary ethical option. 
Normative ethical theories (about duty, virtue, pleasure, the divine will, etc.) are normally taken to be competing and non-trivially distinct from metaethical theories about what grounds duties, virtues, human pleasure, God's decrees, etc. This received wisdom is wise. And yet, to paraphrase Thomas Nagel, sanity in our metaethics is most preserved by keeping primary ethical concerns near to our mind. Ethical naturalism best “fits” with consequentialism. Ethical non-naturalism bets “fits” with platonism or theism. 
Virtue ethics as a primary ethical option bets fits with ethical naturalism, or so it has been treated. But I shall explore this in greater detail. 
Aristotle’s ethical stance in Nichomachean Ethics and elsewhere is highly demanding. If it gives us any direction, within a secular society or broadly naturalistic philosophical community, then we must be clear that the directions it gives are right before trying to follow them.
And neo-Aristotlianism is compatible with theism, an option I hope to explore in future writings but shall only touch on here. 
But the metaethical question will remain: is neo-Aristotelianism naturalistic? The worry comes from three possible objections: is it atheistic enough or compatible with atheism? Is it too physicalistic or too biological? (For we will already have argued that physicalistic ethic is an oxymoron.)And most importantly, does it violate the continuity of nature by making humans radically discontinuous with the rest of biology, matter, and the cosmos? 

How to categorize my thesis

The normative considerations in the first and last chapters might be called applied ethical. After all, we are trying to give good reasons and hear good reasons for our metaethical theory in order to *know* what to do with our ethical theories, and we care about our ethical theories (in part) because we care about our lives. We want to live well, not badly. The "metaphysics of ethics" we must do (in response to Kant and Frank Jackson) to get a hold on human nature and the norms to which we are naturally sensitive requires a bit of metaphysical legwork. And, of course, there will inevitably be some room for moral epistemology, semantics, and moral motivation. With the great danger ever present that on any of these various topics I will misstep, I trust in the reader not to scoff but to correct, not to laugh but to help me learn.  

Theism and Naturalism as cosmologies
For even if Theory A is more plausible than Theory B within the domain of discourse of which the theories are a part, one’s background cosmology may determine that Theory B is the only one consistent with those beliefs. Theory B is, on that ground, more plausible all things considered. For instance, for a theist whose background beliefs include the belief that God made the world and created life, the theory of undirected biological evolution is going to be weighed against theories of directed evolution. Even if undirected evolutionary progress is more plausible within the domain of biology, the theory of directed evolution will be, for that theorist, more plausible all things considered. Or again, for an atheist whose background beliefs include the belief that the concepts and images of god/gods are products of human imagination and culture, the theory

            <Title>### *Dependent Rational Animals* ### </Title>
            <Text>### *Dependent Rational Animals* ###

This discussion has, so far, kept itself mostly to *After Virtue*, only alluding to other works in the “*After Virtue* Project.” I would like now to continue the story by including some themes and details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to a critical response. 

The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally important as our independence, our autonomy and self-sufficiency; there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate or overshadow the commonalities between us and other animals. “I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

The important connection to *Whose Justice? Which Rationality* should be clear: rationality *taken as the whole process of judging truth and falsity* is a continuum that includes us and “lower” animals. 

Regarding (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says he “virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities they're specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how do while they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8]

In other words, an important truth missing from both the Aristotelian tradition and the tradition of modern liberalism is emphasis on the virtues of acknowledged dependence. In this we can clearly see MacIntyre’s essentially *progressive* aspirations. By imbibing the tradition of virtue and reflecting upon it, we can notice conflicts and miniature crises that spur us to improvements. 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9]

So we may fairly draw this connection between *Dependent Rational Animals* and *After Virtue*: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and virtues must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

On the one extreme, we are not mere worms or beasts (without any practical reason whatsoever) nor, on the other extreme, are we autonomous gods (without any dependency whatsoever). A human being is a practical reasoner in a human community. I would venture so far as to suggest this axiom as a definition of our species. (It is more accurate than flat-nailed featherless bipeds.) We are social animals by nature, and we are practical animals by nature, and we are reasoners by nature.</Text>

            <Title>### We are practical reasoners ### </Title>
            <Text>### Human virtue as practical reasoning since human nature is practical reason ###

As for human nature, human beings are practical reasoners; we are dependent, rational animals. That is what we are. To suppose we have a “nature” is not out-dated, outmoded, irrelevant, obsolete, unscientific, or any other such prejudicial pejorative. 

Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] And we are practical reasoners (more on that below). We are in a position to see how MacIntyre’s account of virtue works. We find ourselves in a tradition (or more than one). Within that, we find ourselves engaging in practices. We engage in some of these practices inside, and others outside, institutions. Virtues are those skills that enable us to perform the practice excellently; virtues are also those skills and habits by which we perform various social roles excellently; but finally virtues are those qualities by which we aim our practices toward an excellent human life, and by which we integrate our various social roles toward human ends. For instance, the most general virtuous qualities contribute to the flourishing of human being qua practical reasoner. The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. The “human nature” that is universally distributed across each member of our species is the capacity (sometimes unrealized) to become practical reasoners. This  makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. 

We are practical reasoners. Observations we can readily make to support this axiom are so abundant it is hard to know where to start: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. 

Each of these situations, I hope, so familiar that my analysis will not (yet!) be controversial. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

If this is true, the converse would be true: those who are not practical reasoners, or not in community, are not human. Regardless of whether this strikes a false note for the reader, it is at least intelligible. this corollary is the natural extension of the Greek view that exile was on par with, if not worse than, public execution. To remove you from your community is in an important sense to destroy you as a person. A hanging or poisoning only destroys you as a body. An exile is far worse than that. It rips you from your context, tears out from the social fabric the thread that you are. It turns you, while existing, into a non-being, a non-entity, an object. Regardless of whether we can sympathize with this way of thinking about exile, we can understand how one can be demoted from human status. 

We should not say that a non-practical-reasoner is not human, but that they fail to be exemplary. Brain-dead, or mentally handicapped, or injured etc., persons are not non-human but they are importantly defective qua humans, as I think common sense can recognize. </Text>

            <Text>Literature Review
Virtue ethics
The four objections (from naturalism)

In the last chapter, we set out the explananda and narrowed down our desired explanans to (a) one that explains all these well, and is (b)  normative realist and (c) naturalist. This chapter advances my view. The explanans I offer satisfies at least the first two. I consider the best objections I know that it satisfies the third.  



The remainder of the dissertation will be discussing rival metaethical views especially in light of their inability to satisfy one or more of these criteria. I do not take my task to be to comprehensively settle the matter. Rather, I take it to be the task of defining what kind of explanations we are looking for, and showing how one is far more plausible than the others, despite its shortcomings. The metaethics of virtue ethics is a field ripe for new research and insight. I take my contribution to be but a beginning.

            <Title>What are we trying to explain?</Title>
            <Text>What are we trying to explain? 
That we ought to love each other is true if anything is true. Whatever I want you to do for me, I should do for you. Many of subsequent reflections about naturalism and about virtue are attempts to do justice to this truth. 
Life as lived is puzzling. Among the many puzzles that confront us, some of the most enduringly fun and bewildering are ethical puzzles about how we know what is good and whether there is a good at all.  These questions are given a special bite. 

Not moral guidance
The explananda that our metaethical theorizing aims to explain is not easy to define. Here are some things I don’t think we are trying to explain: we are not trying to give moral guidance to the morally confused. Most people have firm moral convictions on a wide range of issues. Theists have ready-made moralities on a wide range of issues given to them, they take it, by god. Atheists as it happens often have a wide range of moral beliefs based on the responsibility we have as humans if we are alone in the universe and solely responsible for our destinies, our disasters, and our hopes. In An Atheist’s Guide to Reality by Alex Rosenburg, as a popular middlebrow example, he lays out how atheists ought to approach personal, interpersonal, and political challenges that life puts before each of us. By contrast, Peter Kreeft’s  Making Choices is a theistic version of much the same guide. 

Not just disagreement but agreement
There are certainly moral disagreements at a cultural level, [which we have already had occasion to mention: abortion, sexual ethics, family ethics, international law, legal policy, foreign policy, poverty and wealth, religious freedom, freedom of speech, etc.] and within sub-cultures and even within each of us. But disagreement is most often between parties dedicated to a firm moral conviction. We are therefore not doing metaethics to give the morally confused a bit of advice. We are usually doing metaethics to examine why we have the moral beliefs we do, and whether they can be justified. If they can’t be justified, then we may want some suggestion as to whether to discard them, to hold them with quietism, to hold them “ironically” as Rorty suggests, and so on. 

Normativity
What we are puzzling over is normativity. In light of naturalism broadly construed — in light of modern empirical science and reductive philosophy — we are puzzling over the contrast between norms and everything else non-normative. Everything that is puzzling, from naturalistic assumptions, about moral norms is equally or almost equally puzzling about epistemic norms, as Professor Cuneo has labored to show. (@Cuneo %) For this reason, it would be wrong-headed and myopic to speak only of moral norms. All of these are interesting and more or less puzzling: Epistemic norms, aesthetic norms, political norms (laws), prudential norms, norms of intentionality in both thought and language, mathematical and logical norms, even norms of etiquette and grammar. Peter Schaber distills this list into ought-statements, value-statements, and reason-statements. (% @Schaber 1)
  
Normativity as it shows up in everyday utterances like “that was a good movie, thanks for the recommendation” or she is a good teacher; you should take her class” but also much more: Normativity shows up in my private thoughts (“how can I lose weight? what is wrong with my health?”) in communication (“what do you think of your Sienna? Is it better or worse than your old Odyssey?”) and in deliberation (“what is to be done with Iran? Is Guantanomo Bay to be shut down?”). We are trying to explain the pervasiveness of normativity. 

"Philosophical appeals to normativity are also exceptionally widespread. In addition to the subjects traditionally considered ‘normative’—ethics, practical reason, political and legal philosophy and epistemology—it is increasingly common for philosophers to maintain that normativity is essential in the analysis of subjects as diverse as truth, meaning, probability and psychological attitudes like belief." Finlay, “Recent work on Normativity”, Analysis. % Add vol. Year, number



Practical Reason
Our life, not just our biological life, is full of goals. Whether our biology is full of goals — is teleologically oriented — is an important question. But our psychological, social, and political life is most emphatically goal-oriented. We do not just live but we live for. We live for each other, for our job, for love, for the hope of a better society, for our children, for pleasure, for God, for something. What explains this? 

“MacIntyre convincingly proves that rationality and ethics are inseparable; that it is impossible for the unjust person to think rationally, or for the irrational person to be just. Consequently, the liberal presumption of a shared, ahistorical, “objective” rationality which can be brought to bear to resolve differences in values and conceptions of justice, is a delusion. He further shows that no conception of justice and ethical life is possible outside of some real community in some place at some time, and that liberalism, despite its protestations, is a tradition, along with founding fathers, sacred texts, hierarchy, political power, social interests, institutions, etc., etc., like any other tradition, and he discloses the particular features of modernity which underlie liberal individualism. Liberalism differs from other traditions though, in it does not recognise itself as a tradition, harbours the illusion that it is able to fully comprehend other traditional modes of thought, and subsume their needs within itself, and that it is invulnerable to criticism from outside of liberalism. This self-deception leaves it vulnerable.” (Andy Blunden, http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/macintyre.htm) 

Objective Purport 1
Furthermore, our evaluative talk purports to be about facts. Peter Schaber says, ““A normative fact is, I take it in accordance with the usual understanding of the concept of a fact, what corresponds to a true normative statement.” (@Schaber 1) Michael Smith summarizes one of the two ”features of morality" as "we seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts" (Smith, 1994, 8). 

It would be helpful to this end to be able to account for why some things seem objective (morality, etiquette, fashion, grammar) but also why only some are objective (morality), or to explain the objective skeleton of grammar and etiquette with the subjective bones. For example, it might be that injunctions like “don’t be rude” hold as part of a theory of objective value, universal, and cross-cultural — but that the exact specifications of what counts as rude in 21st century America are not universal, objective, or cross-culturally true.  
</Text>
            <Comments>This point is made also by Darwall in Metaethics After Moore. Normativity is what distinguishes the good (what we ought to value, promote, pursue, etc.) from the real (what is).

            <Title>Virtue as Natural Excellence</Title>
            <Text>	1.	## Chapter Introduction ##
	2.	In this chapter, we turn our attention to Philippa Foot. Philippa Foot is a widely celebrated and idiosyncratic author. Her writings have been influential but often misunderstood. She does not — and proudly does not — conform to some of the pervasive expectations on analytic philosophers (and especially ethicists). This non-conformity both frees her from common prejudices and subjects her to uncommon misunderstandings. 
	3.	Her main thesis in “natural goodness” is similarly teleological: ‘goodness’ is a functional concept and applies (at least) to all *living natural* entities. “Natural goodness” for her does not refer to “natural law.”[@foot2001natural chapter 1] Foot’s contribution to an adequate foundation of virtue will be to render this account more plausible and to extend it by insightful reflection on moral language. Foot’s Natural Goodness (among other) also affords us an opportunity to revisit the assumptions of G.E. Moore and the Principia Ethica, criticizing them from a different angle than MacIntyre. 
	4.	In the last chapter, we saw that teleology — at least social teleology —  is essential to ethics. Teleology is also a best “fit” for virtue ethics rather than modern rationalistic Kantian and utilitarian theories that make *duties themselves* or the external, contingent *consequences of actions* play the definitive role. Teleology may or may not be “natural” more broadly (inherent to the cosmos as a whole or inherent to all living things) but it is intrinsic to *human practices*. And, human practices, are *human*. We are practical creatures by nature. We’ve called this practicality and the claim that such practicality is end-directed or teleological “social teleology.”

For Foot, a person’s virtue is their excellence as a member of their species. 

Moral goodness is areatic. And the excellent expression of the species of a lifeform is deep happiness. So she is a eudaemonist. 

But some of the most powerful objections to eudaemonism are from naturalists and non-naturalists of the post-Moore era. So Foot’s *Natural Goodness* begins with a insightful invective against Moore’s *Principia Ethica*. Her account, perhaps more than any other, revives a neo-Aristotelianism that is liable to persuade even dyed-in-the-wool modernists.

            <Title>Four Objections Answered</Title>
            <Text>In this chapter I combine my new specification of naturalism with my neo-Aristotleian account to answer, definitively, in what way neo-Aristotelianism is 

	1)	Divinity objection: Virtue ethics has been traditionally the purview of theists, from the divine nous of Aristotle to the divine logos of the Stoics to the divine Trinity of Aquinas, and orthodox naturalism tends to be atheistic, agnostic, or post-theist (apathetic).  If we come to believe that humans participate in the divine nous, are indwelt by a divine spark, or made in the image of God, it seems that we have left naturalism far behind. 

	1)	Teleology objection: Virtue ethics assumes or argues for teleology in nature, without which evaluations of living things including humans cannot get off the ground. An individual cactus or deer is evaluated by how well it instantiates the lifeform of its species. By contrast, Darwinism or neo-Darwinism is orthodox biology that is committed, it seems, to the view of disenchanted nature as a mono-causal order of efficient and material causation without final causation.  The orthodox “transformism” that has held majority sway since Darwin implies that lifeforms are essentially plastic or fluid, which entails that deviation from the norm may be a defect or simply a new adaptive mutation. Marinus Ferreira, “Reasons from Neo-Aristotelian Naturalism”   Stephen Brown articulates the objection that there may not even be a human lifeform, in which case the basis for ethical and other normative evaluations is gone. Stephen Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue”, Ethic@, Vol. 4., n. , P. 7-22, 2005.  

	1)	Normative human nature objection: Virtue ethics also assumes that human nature or the human lifeform is so to speak normatively loaded. The very term virtue (a cognate of the Latin word for man) implies that humanity is a normative concept; a human can become fully human or inhuman. That is, one can fail to achieve one’s own humanity or one can become truly human.  Some ethical naturalists also put themselves at risk of this objection, when they ground normative facts and “queer” values in humanity as if that were enough. For instance, Hursthouse says hers is an  enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being”Hursthouse 193. Consequentialists try to demystify “queer” values by grounding them in humanity somehow (our interests, desires, judgments, evaluations, natural ends, etc.). The assumption is that human nature is “natural”, so if values are “humanized” then values become natural. But the shoe could fit the other foot. A critic could object that values are nonnatural so if values are humanized then human nature is nonnatural. Quite possibly, humanizing these mysterious values doesn’t naturalize them, but rather mystifies humanity. By contrast, “A fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature”.Brown 2004, p. 4. McDowell sees the parity between reason and practical reason, and so naturalizes both in “second nature.” Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. The point is that if humanity is discontinuous with nature then we seem to have a bi-furcated naturalism that violates the continuity of nature.

	1)	Normative rationality objection: Virtue ethics seems to elevate the status of humanity above other animals and perhaps the rest of nature. More specifically, it tends to make reason and practical reason special. For instance, Julia Annas asks: “Does …[a strong] relation between our rationality and the rest of our human nature as social animals give us a plausible form of naturalism? We might think not, if we think that the Aristotelian form is a plausible one. For it stresses continuities between the evaluative patterns in our lives and those that are to be found in the lives of plants and animals. The fact that we are rational animals makes a big difference…” Annas, “What kind of naturalism?” She notes that the more we emphasize our rationality, the less important appears that which we share with the rest of nature (our animality and materiality). She seems to endorse the stronger form of rationality despite the tension. Stephen Brown on the other hand is willing to bite the bullet that some or all of the normative authority of our rationality might be lost if we concede that humans are really continuous with plants and animals. He somewhat regretfully admits (while defending neo-Aristotelian naturalism!) that his uncompromisingly naturalistic virtue ethic “amounts to a kind of evolutionary ethics and, in the end, is fundamentally descriptive” Brown, Moral Virtue and Nature 1. He notes that the more we emphasize our common ancestry, our basic biological animality and (ultimately) origin of all living things in non-living chemicals and elements, the less important appears our normative rationality.

            <Title>Walterstorff, Justice: Rights and Wrongs</Title>
            <Text>Wolterstorff, Justice  
Nicholas Wolterstorff, Justice, Princeton University Press, Princeton: 2008. 

Overview:
Wolterstorff aims to give an account of justice as natural rights in order to defend those who have been wronged. He aims to use rights-talk because it ‘brings to speech’ the ‘patient-dimension’ of moral action, that is, not the one who acts rightly or wrongly but the one wronged or loved. 

What is a right? A “normative social relationship” (12). What is justice? “I think of a social order as just insofar as its members enjoy the goods to which they have rights” (10). The alternative is that justice is “natural law for the right ordering of society” — the objective and transcendent agent-dimension rather than the subjective immanent patient-dimension. 

What is the issue? 1. It seems to be “are there natural rights?” but even right-order theorists can concede that there are. 2. It seems to be “are there inherent natural rights (or only conferred by God, by law, by government, etc.)? But the right order theorist can concede that God has natural rights (Chp 3). 3. It seems to be “are there inherent human natural rights?” 

Synopsis:

Introduction: 

Should we use justice talk? 
It seems we ought not use justice talk.
1.	For Love has transcended justice (1).
2.	The ethic of care is less individualistic than justice (2).
On the other hand, justice is the members enjoying the goods to which they have rights. 
1.	No response yet
2.	No response yet

Should we use rights-talk?
It seems that we ought not use rights-talk. 
1.	For some alleged rights are silly (2). 
2.	It has empowered all the largest (and wrong-headed) social protest movements of the 20th century (2-3); 
3.	Rights-talk is inherently individualistic, egoistic, and possessive (3).
4.	For it is nonsense (4)

On the other hand, I argue that rights are “normative social bonds” and that word/concept is both true and needful (4-5). 

On rights
1.	Some rights are silly, but others are not. We must correct rather than abolish the rights-talk (2).
2.	Rights-talk has empowered these movements by focussing on/talking about the oppressed, the wronged, and that’s as it should be. Only oppressors want to keep attention off the moral-patient (6).
3.	Rights-talk is only contingently egoistic and individualistic (6); 
4.	We can develop an account that is not nonsense.

Whether justice should be grounded in inherent rights or right order?


Normative social bonds are claims against me had by others that I act or refrain from acting in particular ways. Rights-talk is necessary to “bring to speech” the “recipient-dimension” or “patient-dimension” of duty, obligation, guilt, benevolence, virtue, etc (7-8). 

It seems that justice is “right order”, not grounded ultimately on inherent rights (10). But they are. “A social order [is] just insofar as its members enjoy the good to which they have rights” (10). 

Some rights are conferred (by God, an objective norm, or society), others are inherent. 

Whether there is a third conception of justice as equality? 
It seems that there is a third conception of justice. For...
1.	It seems that justice is equality, as Aristotle assumes, and Aquinas and Hume concede (13-14).
2.	Justice is always comparative. 
3.	Aquinas’ view of justice as both “external” to humanity (in Divine Natural Law) and “internal” to humanity (in imprinted Natural Law), since we partake of God’s eternal reason and eternal law (I-II, 91, 2).  

On the other hand, these “third” ways are either false or reduce, under scrutiny, to the same two options. 

1.	But “justice is sometimes present when equality of treatment is absent, and equality is sometimes present when justice is absent” (14). 
2.	Justice is not always comparative, because a student whose work merits an A does so whether or not there are other students, or regardless of what other students merit (15). 
3.	Strictly speaking, Aquinas does not give an account of justice (42). He merely talks about the feature (equality) of some or all instantiations of justice. So he has the same two choices of justice as grounded in objective right order or subjective inherent rights. 

Whether Wolterstorff agrees or disagrees with Rawls? 
Rawl’s theory of justice assumes “justice [as] inherent natural rights” — this book is about developing an account of that assumption (15).  
Chapter 2. A Contest of Narratives
The “polemic” that treats justices as right order instead of inherent rights is a narrative. Ockham is blamed as the father of modern rights. 

Joan O’Donovan and Alistair MacIntyre, Michael Villey, Leo Strauss tell the narrative; Brian Tierney and Charles Reid tell the counter narrative. The 12th and 13th century thinkers like Decretists, popes, and emperors were talking about ius as both objective law and subjective right (54-55). They spoke of power, faculty, liberties, authority, and justice, as well as “right” (57). 

Villey’s narrative has two “main parts” (48). Earlier Latin jurists were not using our concept of right when they used ‘ius,’ and that Ockham is somehow the culprit of the decline from Thomism (48-49). 

Thirdly, the story goes,  Enlightenment thinkers (HObbes, Locke, etc.) built on this foundation by arguing that the individuals are bearers of subjective rights and “the principal task of the state” is to protect those rights (51). This is the “possessive individualism” that is the bugbear of the rights-talk-is-bad narrative. 

The counter-narrative shows that earlier thinkers did use ‘ius’ in our sense (54ff). It exists in the Roman jurists, according to Donahue, where a right is ‘had’ by someone or ‘belongs’ to someone (59). Maybe not natural rights but definitely subjective rights. The Church Fathers speak of what is due to the poor, what belongs to them (61).

So what is the real issue? (62). Whether natural rights are conferred (by God, man, or ‘some objective norm’) or inherent. “Tierney and Reid do not address the issue.”

Chapter 3. Justice in the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible

What is mishpat? Primary or secondary justice? O’Donovan seems to think it is only secondary. The Hebrew word for justice is “mishpat” and righteousness is “tsedeqa.” Mishpat connotes judicial performance (69). It is not about primary justice but rectifying justice (71). Oliver O’Donovan seems to be making the error of saying there can be secondary justice (going back to the correct state of things) without primary justice (the correct state of things) —- which is incoherent (72). So mishpat must refer to both (75). 

The ‘quartet of the vulnerable’ are the widows, orphans, poor, and foreigners. Justice requires care for these. Not overly-preferential in their favor, but not under-preferential (77-78). God took care of the low ones (us!) so we are to take care of the low ones (80-81). God loves justice (81-82). God enjoins justice in Isreal but outside as well (82-88). We can wrong the lowly, but in so doing we wrong God as well (89). 

Is this more a right-order or inherent-rights notion? They don’t have “theory” so we have to interpret their assumptions (91). 
●	Is there recognition of the recipient-side, the patient-dimension? 
○	Since God can be wronged, it seems so.
○	“wronging” God means “depriving him of that to which he has a right” 
●	Is there recognition of human worth? 
●	Is there recognition that the worth of persons grounds how they ought to be treated?


Chapter 4. On De-Justicizing the New Testament
The agapism of Nygren urges that justice has been ecclipsed by a love that gives people what is not their due, that confers rather than recognizes worth. Eros love seeks the well-being of the lover; nomos is basically justice, but agape does not love people because they are infinitely valuable but because he is a lover and gives the gift of value (100). “There is no motive for the love in the loved object itself....” (102, quoting Nygren). Agape might be grounded in “attachment” (affection?) (103). 

But what about our love for God? We cannot love God (neither with eros nor agape) — so that seems to be a reductio. 

Also, forgiveness requires the violation of a right or the violation of justice (106). 

Also, we cannot “forgive” (as in permit to continue doing evil) someone who is perpetrating evil on another. We have to protect the victim (108). 

Chapter 5. Justice in the New Testament Gospels
Justice is much discussed in Luke-Acts — if we translate dike and its cognates as justice rather than righteousness, which has very different connotations (111). Jesus is presented as the justice-bringing par excellence, the same justice bearer from the Old Testament (115). 

Chapter 6. Locating That To Which We Have Rights
We have rights to life-goods. 
“I take the good to be that which is worthy of approbation” (144). 

We have rights to states of affairs (within our lives and histories) that “contribute positively to the worth of that life or history” (145). 

But there are three kinds of ‘good life’. Experientially satisfying, happy, and flourishing (145). 

The experientially satisfying life is most at home in the utilitarian tradition, and cannot serve as a framework for Wolterstorf’s rights. 
Chapter 7. Why Eudaimonism Cannot Serve
Eudaimonia “cannot serve” as a framework for a theory of rights. Happiness is an activity (152). It is not egoism, at least not under any specific description thereof (153). 

Stoics treat virtue as the only good per se with preferables (like fame, wealth, good birth, good repute) as goods--kinda. The Peripatetic Aristotelians treat internals like virtue and externals like wealth and friends as goods both. 

“A theory of rights needs the idea of a person’s worth requiring that she be treated in certain ways. The eudaimonist speaks only of the worth of life-goods and of conditions and means for those; the worth of personas and human beings has no place in his scheme. What he says about life-goods is that they are all activities and that each of us must choose among them with the goal in mind of enhancing one’s own happiness. There is no room in this scheme for the worth of persons and human beings, and hence none for one’s right against others to their treating one a certain way on account of one’s worth.” (179).

Chapter 9. 

Chapter 10. 

Reflections:
The discussion of rights as pernicious moral vocabulary is just the one I have been wanting. He cites and summarizes (in more detail than I could have) exactly the objections I have picked up from here and there. I don’t believe in rights. MacIntyre doesn’t believe in rights (After Virtue, chp. 6 — ‘Some Consequences of the Failure of the Enlightenment Project’). Rights only come into being with the deterioration and collapse of “hierarchy, teleology,” a Logo-centric worldview, like buildings collapse in an earthquake. Wolterstorff acknowledges all this narrative. 

I’m not sure if the word-concept fallacy is not running riot here. If we define rights as “normative social relationships” that emphasize the “patient-dimension” of those norms (the one suffering wrong) rather than the “agent-dimension” (the one doing wrong), then sure, those are Biblical things. But the primary worry I have is the secular grounding of rights he discusses in the antepenultimate chapter. 

He says “For the right order theorist, the violation of someon’s natural rights is never, in itself and as such, the treating of a human being with less than due respect. It is always instead an indicator of the fact that some natural law of objective obligation has been disobeyed. A partisan of right order may point to th eplight of the poor, he may say that their rights are being violated. But pointing to the victims is for him a roundabout way of calling attention to the more fundamental fact that the powerful and the well-to-do are not living up to their obligations” (43). I disagree. 

His three criteria for interpreting Biblical teaching on inherent rights make the case easy to argue. 
●	Is there recognition of the recipient-side, the patient-dimension? 
●	Is there recognition of human worth? 
●	Is there recognition that the worth of persons grounds how they ought to be treated?
If that’s all that he means by rights, then fine. 

The argumentation throughout the book is excellent. But the places where it is most needed it is most thin. Take page 95, where he spends three short paragraphs (less than a page!) arguing the do-or-die point that the Bible indicates that “human beings have inherent worth... and that they thought of that worth as grounding rights”... He quotes Psalm 8 that man is placed in a cosmic hierarchy below angels and crowned with glory and honor and dominion. And he quotes Genesis that we ought not shed human blood because God made humankind in his own image. That’s it. 

He picks up this theme in the next chapter (5), but only gives it a page (130-1). The human beings have more value than birds (Luke 12:24, Matthew 6:26, Matt. 10:31). We are more valuable than sheep (Matt 12:11ff). To be a human being is to have human worth, according to Jesus. QED. 

“I take the good to be that which is worthy of approbation” (144). Better to say I take approbation to be the good response to the good. 

The fact that Wolterstorff rejects Eudaimonism is interesting to me. He argues that eudaimonism “won’t serve” as a framework for rights, and this cowardly, pragmatic way of phrasing it hides the judgment “eudaimonism is false” or better, “It is false that happiness is our ultimate end as humans.” Perhaps the conditional is that ‘if eudaimonism is true, then rights-talk is ultimately dispensable.’ In which case Wolterstorff wants to argue it is indispensable so there must be something false about eudaimonism; I would (as of now, prior to further reflection)

            <Text>### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

It is clear from Aristotle’s “source text” how MacIntyre is a member of that broad and ancient — but still lively — tradition. For MacIntyre, moral inquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such inquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature.

            <Title>Practical Reason</Title>
            <Text>“To answer this question, Hursthouse utilizes what we might call a “thick” notion of rationality. Not only must an individual take the right steps to her ends, but she must also take the right steps toward the right ends. The right ends are, simply, those ends that are natural to creatures like us. To be rational, then, is to act in such a way that one effectively realizes those natural ends.20 This provides us with an answer to the preceding objection. It is true that individual human beings have a complex system of ends and goals that they consciously pursue. These ends are related to the characteristic ends included in our lifeform either by being identical to those ends or by being ways through which those ends are realized. Of course, if someone were to set goals that conflicted with the ends natural to us, on this view of what counts as rational we would be forced to conclude that that person was behaving irrationally. Moreover, on such a neo-Aristotelian account, the person is also behaving immorally, for to be rational is to be moral. In fact, the terms are more or less synonymous.” (Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue” p. 9). 

To be moral is to be (practically) rational. That is, practical reason is the mood of reason we are talking about, not theoretical or abstract or speculative reason. To be moral is not merely to avoid harming others. To be moral includes doing what makes sense to do, in light of benefiting others, benefiting oneself, doing what is good in every respect and weighing all those respects. To be moral is to be rational practically, to act rationally, to live according to reason, to do what is reasonable to do, to always act for good reasons. On this account, to be careless and uncompassionate toward others is immoral but no more or less immoral than to be foolish, or impious (of there is a god), or idle. </Text>

            <Text>NON-FICTION WITH SUB-HEADS

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in standard manuscript format with sub-headings inside the chapters.

How To Use This Template
	•	Edit the Title Page document to ensure it contains the correct information.
	•	Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter Subtitle”.
	•	Create a new text document for each sub-section within the chapter folders, giving each the title of the subheading you wish to appear in the text. You can nest text documents for smaller subheadings, like this:
	#
	•	If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer. If you would rather the foreword come after the table of contents - as is sometimes the case - drag the “Foreword” document and drop it below the “Contents” document.
	•	Before compiling, to create your table of contents, simply select all documents you wish to be included in the contents listing (usually this will be the “Foreword”, all chapter folders, and “Endnotes”, but not the nested sub-sections), then go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC. Then paste into the “Contents” document (use Edit &gt; Paste and Match Style to paste without the dotted underline between the chapter names and page numbers). The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document. You don’t need to do this every time you compile, just when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly - they may appear as question marks before doing so.)
	•	If you have no footnotes or endnotes in your text, be sure to delete the “Endnotes” document.
	•	“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Compile your manuscript into standard manuscript format by selecting File &gt; Compile.

Tables and Figures
If you need to use tables or figures in your manuscript, you can refer to them using the following tags, replacing “KEYWORD” with a unique word that identifies your table or figure.

!fig(KEYWORD)
!table(KEYWORD)

For instance, consider the following text, which makes use of such tags.

Table !table(sales): Sales 2011
Table !table(dates): Shipment dates
Figure !fig(skeleton): The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure !fig(malcolmreynolds): The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table !table(sales))… For shipment dates, see table !table(dates)… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure !fig(skeleton))… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure !fig(malcolmreynolds)).

In the compiled document, the above text would look like this:

Table 1: Sales 2011
Table 2: Shipment dates
Figure 1: The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure 2: The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table 1)… For shipment dates, see table 2… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure 1)… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure 2).

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile sheet and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include. You will also need to edit the title prefix in the “Level Settings”.
	•	Hierarchical numbering: If you require hierarchical numbering for sub-sections, choose “Non-Fiction with Sub-Heads (Hierarchical)” from the “Format As” menu in Compile. (If this format isn’t in the list, choose “Manage…” at the bottom of the “Format As” menu and tick “Non-Fiction with Sub-Heads (Hierarchical)” in the panel that appears, then click “OK”. It will then be available in the “Format As” menu.) Alternatively, edit the “Level Settings” for each level in the “Formatting” pane of Compile and add the “&lt;$hn&gt;” (for “hierarchical numbering”) tag to the title prefixes. 
	•	Page header: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile sheet.
	•	Font: To quickly change the font used throughout the compiled document, use “Quick Font Override” in Compile. To change the font size of the various sub-headings, use the “Formatting” pane.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Text>## What is virtue? 

She begins with necessary conditions: A virtue^[She recommends examining Aristotle and Aquinas (and others) for their view on virtue, but cautions against terminological misunderstandings. *Arete* for them refers “also to arts, and even to excellences of the speculative intellect whose domain is theory rather than practice” (@foot2002virtues 2). *Arete ethikai* (or virtues morales) do not correspond to our moral virtues. For us, there are four moral virtues: courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice. For them, wisdom or *phronesis/prudentia* is an intellectual virtue.] is beneficial. She says, “Human beings do not get on well without them. Nobody can get on well if he lacks courage, and does not have some measure of temperance and wisdom, while communities where justice and charity re lacking are apt to be wretched places to live, as Russia was under the Stalinist terror.”[@foot2002virtues 2-3] But whom is benefited? Does a person possessing a virtue benefit the virtuous person or the society in which the virtuous person lives? For some virtues, the answer is more clearly “both”: temperance benefits oneself and one’s family or community. For other virtues, such as justice or charity, the answer is less clear. “It is a reasonable opinion that on the whole a man is better off for being charitable and just, but this is not to say that circumstances may not arise in which he will have to sacrifice everything for charity or justice.”[@foot2002virtues 3]

&gt; Let us say then, leaving unsolved problems behind us, that virtues are in general beneficial characteristics, and indeed ones that a human being needs to have, for his own sake and that of his fellows. This will not, however, take us far towards a definition of a virtue, since there are many other qualities of a man that may be similarly beneficial, as for instance bodily characteristics such as health and physical strength, and mental powers such as those of memory and concentration.[@foot2002virtues 4]

So, what differentiates virtue from strength? At first glance, the answer seems to be something about the will. Virtues are revealed not only by a person’s abilities but by his or her *intentions.* But what are intentions? Foot argues that the ‘will’ must be understood in its broadest sense, “to cover what is wished for as well as what is sought.”[@foot2002virtues

            <Text>### Replies ### 

While I agree with much of MacIntyre’s picture of the development of western civilization, there is far more in his proposals than I can comment on, let alone defend. Instead, I’ll surface and discuss a few particular objections. 

### Response 1 ###

**Incoherence of Tradition Objection.** I’ll respond to the last objection first, since it seems to me the most tangential to MacIntyre’s ethical theory. I think it true that tradition influences our standards of rationality, justice, and virtue, but demonstrably false that it *constitutes* such standards. The law of non-contradiction is the counterexample. 

Every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction; every tradition denies rational agents the right to believe (P &amp; ~P). Any tradition that denies the law of non-contradiction, it seems to me, is an irrational tradition. And I don’t just intend to say it is irrational relative to my own standards of rationality, but that it is irrational full stop and possible to “step outside” my tradition far enough to see that. If there even does exist any person (such as Nagarjuna) or community or tradition that affirms (P &amp; ~P), we ought not interpret them as having a different standard of rationality but rather we ought to interpret them as believing that rationality is an obstacle to nirvana. Affirming contradictions is still irrational, but it is the kind of irrationality needed to do violence to the limits of rationality and transcend them. 

So I think MacIntyre’s unqualified claims about tradition constituting rationality should be limited to claims about other standards for acceptable kinds of evidence, etc. 

### Response 2 **Relativism Objection.**  MacIntyre has himself refuted the charge of relativism multiple times. J. L. A. Smart’s refutation I find the most instructive. 

### Response 3
**Primary Virtue Objection.** Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of virtue is the primary sense? I would disagree that virtues enable an agent to achieve the goods internal to any individual practice (like chess-playing). Those qualities are akin to virtues but not virtues except in a derivative, analogous sense. If I were to emphasize their difference from virtues in the primary sense, I would simply call them individual skills; if I were to emphasize their commonalities, I would call them virtue-skills.  Skills are ‘acquired human characteristics’ that share certain features with virtues: they are habitual, learned, and can contribute to an agent’s character. But they are only derivative in that they contribute to goods of this or that particular practice rather than of the general project of living flourishing human lives. MacIntyre seems to concede this distinction when he concedes that some practices might be oriented toward wicked ends. So virtue-skills are not, by definition, traits that benefit their possessor. 

The second layer of virtue is a skill that emerges within social practices. Skills related to political activity is an example. These skills are not even conceivably individualistic; they are always performed by people with other people within a community. And yet this layer or dimension is not, I would argue, the primary sense of ‘virtue.’ The reason is that communities can be corrupt. An entire social group can engage in a social practice that is itself vicious, that is antithetical to human flourishing. The social practice of trading slaves might be an example. A community composed of members who each have the skill of performing that activity in such a way as to achieve the goods internal to slave-trading would seem to count as “virtuous” by MacIntyre’s loose standard, but this feels forced. The intension of the term ‘virtue’ is partly, by definition, good activities (meaning good for creatures like us). 

So it seems to me important that only MacIntyre’s third layer or dimension of virtue is properly so called. Virtues that contribute to the goods internal to the “practice” of human life as a whole. We must conceive of human life as a narrative unity, with beginning (birth and childhood) middle (maturity and adulthood) and end (decrepitude and death). Those qualities such as courage, moderation, kindness, generosity, affability and so on that contribute to success qua human flourishing are properly virtues. They help us to flourish, they are necessary conditions of a flourishing human person and community. Of course, this is the sense of the term ‘virtue’ that Aristotle gave millennia ago. 

So if only this third dimension of the MacIntyre’s concept of virtue deserves the unqualified epithet ‘virtue,’ and if that concept was already explicated in detail by Aristotle, then is MacIntyre’s painstaking construction of a three-layered account pointless? There is a point of importance to be extracted, I think. That important point can only be seen if one builds up to the concept of virtue from (potentially value-neutral) individual practices or skills to (potentially value-neutral) social practices. 

### Response 4 **Ends/means Objection.**



### Endorsements
One thesis I would like to extract, develop, and defend is this: human practices are necessarily end-directed (teleological). “Social teleology” has at least two and possibly three aspects: individual, collective, and human. The first aspect of social teleology is the end-directed behavior of each agent; the second is the end-directed behavior of social groups, like families, nations, clubs, congregations, and so on. The third, and most objectionable, aspect, is the end-directed activity of our species as a whole. What, if anything, does every human being intentionally pursue? 

The answer to this question is bound to be controversial. But before we try to answer it we can pause and point out that MacIntyre has made the question intelligible and urgent. 

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. And if it is correct, it demands the re-evaluation of some cherished assumptions. 

### Metaphysical Biology Objection

MacIntyre's whole ethical case is built on the recovery of telos. Without telos, there can be no virtue. 

### We need telos for virtue because deontological virtues are too hard
He has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without telos becomes unintelligible. A society that highly values some virtue (say, chastity) but does so only out of habit --  without any wisp of certain knowledge about the effect chastity has on a man or woman's whole life --  will not long retain that high opinion. Chastity as a white-knuckle fiat not to engage in sexual intercourse with anyone other than one's opposite-sex spouse is simply too difficult, psychologically and morally, to seem valuable to someone who has no clue why chastity is so good for us, and why sexual license is so disastrous for humans, families, and societies. 

### Telos and virtue (and life, and self) are an organic whole
If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover telos. That is, we must discover or re-discover the organic holism of the narrative unity of my life, my identity and self-concept, the telos of human life as a species and my own specific telos as a member of that species, and the virtues that are the qualities that enable me to achieve my telos. Not one of these parts can be left out of the whole. 

### What if there are no ends in nature? 
One powerful objection to the recovery of telos is that there is no teleology in nature. There are no *ends* (τελοι). Call this position *teleological nihilism.* There are two forms of teleological nihilism: extreme and moderate. Extreme teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no "purposes" or natural ends anywhere in the world *including* in human actions. Even our practices, behaviors, and lives are purposeless, even to ourselves. Moderate teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no natural purposes *except* those in human actions, intentions, and societies, etc. On moderate teleological nihilism, human purposes are not instances of a broader category that includes the tendency of an acorn to become an oak and the tendency of deer to survive and reproduce; human purposes are sui generis phenomena that spontaneously emerge out of our brains at a certain level of complexity. Final causation thinking is then projected out onto the world by us; we observe that the beaver gathered wood and that the beaver built a dam and we say "the beaver gathered wood *in order to* build the dam." But really the beaver did no such thing. This is what philosopher of biology Ernst Mayr calls "teleonomic" natural behavior, but not genuinely teleological.[@mayr1992teleology] 

Teleological nihilism claims as its evidence *modern science* as a whole. Natural sciences have dismissed the notion of final causation for three or four centuries now and have gotten along well without it. In fact, natural sciences and the experimental, empirical methods that advance them have progressed far more than anyone could have dreamed. In part, this success is the result of giving up magical thinking. 

### Even if there were no natural teloi, human action is teleological
MacIntyre has a powerful response to this objection. It is, I think, satisfying. And that is that the conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology can be side-stepped. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups (the Republican or Democratic Party, the YMCA, the U.S.A., the Parent Teacher Association, Starbucks) is end-directed actions and practices. That is enough. Call it "social teleology." 

Christine Korsgaard has defended the notion of practical reason as the faculty we discover in ourselves *after* we are already acting in the world and reflecting upon our actions.[@korsgaard1996authority] It is not really up for debate that we are reflective creatures; everyone reading this is capable of reflecting on their actions, asking for and providing *reasons* for action that may or may not justify the action. This is close, I think, to MacIntyre's way of thinking. 

Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. Telos can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With telos firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether telos exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

            <Text>A double danger
My goal is not to write from within my tradition as a theist and indeed a Christian. The resources available for thinking about virtue are much greater. Rather, if the church to which I belong is a citadel on the hill, and the broader western tradition is a city spread out like a wheel on the surrounding terrain, my goal is to leave the citadel and see how much work can be done in the city. Outside the city, of course, are the villages, towns, and countryside homes. And beyond that, wilderness. I shall not have much to say to the wild men who are utter moral strangers. 
The double danger of limiting myself to what can be said about virtue and nature from within a public and secular tradition is that both audiences are liable to misunderstand me: fellow theists or fellow Christians in particular may assume that I ignore the extra resources available to me out of disbelief or ignorance; fellow westerners who do belong or might belong to the tradition of Aristotle will assume that I consider the more narrow domain of secular discourse as a means of proselytizing for my faith, inching towards God. Both sides may think me either disingenuous or misguided. This is a danger that can be mitigated by explicit avowals of my true intentions. But such misunderstandings cannot be wholly guarded against. I think the reward is worth the risk. To detail neo-Aristotelianism and to give a novel account of naturalism that both theists and atheists or agnostics can consider, modify, and in part accept, is worth all the trouble.

            <Text>What is virtue ethics?
Virtue theory is hard to characterize. What distinguishes it from deontology and utilitarianism, its major theoretical rivals? Invoking a distinction from Roger Crisp, Brown distinguishes between virtue ethics (which prescribes advocates virtues) and virtue theory (which engages in virtue talk). 


Stephen Brown’s answer
	◆	Not "emphasis", since utilitarians and deontologists can emphasize virtues (Brown 2008, 12).
	◆	Rather "the difference between these three views lies in the different reasons a proponent would provide to explain why the virtues are good to have... how the virtue are justified... how their goodness is explained" (Brown 2008, 12)
	◆	A virtue theory is on in which "as Statman puts it, 'the basic judgements in ethics are judgements about character'" or ones in which "the concept of a virtue offers the most useful *criterion* for the rightness of an act." 
	◆	Aristotle's virtue theory argues that a good human life is by definition the exercise of virtues, implying that virtues are not only worth having but the only goods worth having. 
	◆	Brown's virtue theory is "moderate" in that virtues are not "theoretically fundamental" but "ethically fundamental" (15). 


Brown's rivals are not other ethical naturalisms but non-naturalists and non-cognitivists. He hopes to beat them in overall plausibility -- reading 'plausibility' as having an account that "accords with our pretheoretic ideas and intuitions about the ethical phenomena in question" (16). 



Minimal Virtue Ethics (Neo-Aristotelian)

My hypothesis is that virtue ethics demands a teleological view of nature. Naturalism’s strength is that it is flexible enough to adapt to cataclysmic new discoveries. Naturalism’s danger is that it is too strong, invincible, non-falsifiable. 

Maximal Virtue Ethics (Aristotle) 


“The idea that there is a human telos carries with it its own problems. Most obviously, it has at least so far proven impossible to unite all people behind a particular idea of what that telos is, or to demonstrate how we can be sure that a telos even exists. Often, the idea that nature or the gods want people to pursue certain goals and behave in certain ways has been used as a pretext for human tyranny. Many would point to the Taliban in Afghanistan, or the Catholic Inquisition, as an example of this. Also, there have been historical eras in which people in different societies strongly believed that there was a telos, but disagreed about what it was (in fact, the era of the polis in Greece was one such era). This has often led to war. The liberal idea of religious toleration, based on the idea that the proper work of government is the protection of people's bodies and property rather than their soul (see Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration), was in part the result of the religious wars, which were in part about the best life for human beings, that ravaged Europe for centuries (and ravage other parts of the world today). MacIntyre points out, however, that just because we haven't reached agreement on this subject doesn't mean that we can't, and he argues that the belief that we can't is a historically specific belief, rather than an objective and permanent truth about how the world works. If we reason correctly, and examine competing philosophical traditions of moral enquiry, we can choose the most accurate one. (This is the task of Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry).” Ted Clayton, "Political Philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre," Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 

Clayton mentions four objections to the idea of telos. 
1. Agreement about whether a telos exists, and if so what it is, has not yet been reached. 
2. The notion that a telos exists in nature or by a god's beck has been used by tyrants, religious fanatics. 
3. Different historical times, places, and peoples have disagreed about what the telos is. </Text>

            <Text>Normativity and Naturalism (Practical Philosophy) Hardcover – July 15, 2004
by Peter Schaber

Especially the essays by Copp and Schaber. 


He also has a shorter essay just called “normative facts.”

It moves quickly but is quite good. Schaber argues that normative truths answer to normative facts. Normative facts are just facts of the world, admittedly the “normative world”. 

He agrees most with Nagel about normative truths but is willing to avow normative facts that make them true. He avows the mind world fit picture of truth that Rorty denies, the representation of the world or nature.

He argues that normative facts are not reducible to natural facts. But at the same time, it is the natural facts that do the motivating. Reason giving is different from motivating.

Descriptive statements have, as Michael Smith puts it, another direction of fit than normative statements have.3 Descriptive statements have to fit the world. Normative statements on the other hand do not have to fit the world. It is rather the other way round: The world has to fit them. Take the following example: I think that you ought to write a paper. The fact that you have not done it yet is no reason for me to rethink my view that you ought to write a paper. This is of course not the case with regard to descriptive statements: Seeing that my computer has a virus is indeed a good reason to drop the view I hold that my computer is virus-free. Normative statements do not refer to something that is supposedly the case; this is why they do not have to fit the world: They tell you what you should do, not what you did or what you are about to do. If so, normative realism - this the expressivist conclusion - cannot account for the normativity of normative sentences. The expressivist can do so: Normative statements express subjective states such as desires the world must fit with.4

“Plato’s Forms give a dramatic picture of what objective values (normative facts) would have to be. The form of the Good is such that knowledge of it provides the knower with both a direction and an ovverriding motive; something’s being good both tells the person who knows this to pursue it and make him pursue it. An objective good would be sought by anyone who was acquainted with it, not because of any contingent fact that this person, or every person, is so constituted that he desires this end, but just because the end has to-be-pursuedness somehow built into it.

Thus, desires and normative statements (‘You ought to do x’) have the same direction of fit. Unlike descriptive statements normative statements do not have to fit the world. This is the reason - so the Humean model tells us - why the normative meaning of normative statements can accounted for by desires and of course not by normative facts. In addition defenders of the Humean model think that this account of normativity has also the advantage of not presupposing metaphysically dubious entities such as normative facts and properties. Desires are part of the world that we know; they are - unlike normative facts and properties the object of the natural and social sciences.

If you want x to be the case you ought to choose y. But interestingly enough, this is not a desire based ought. It is just a fact that one ought to choose the means to your ends independently of whether you want to do so or not. Desires are linked to oughts due to this normative principle. So it cannot itself be based on a desire. You ought to follow it regardless of whether you want to follow it or not. Thus there were no instrumental oughts if this normative fact (the fact that you ought to choose the appropriate means to your ends) did not obtain.

The important point is: The normative statement mentioned does not express a desire: It rather refers to a normative fact, that is to something which is independent of whether it is desired: It is just a fact that one ought to choose the means to one’s ends. If so, I do not see why the same should not apply to the other oughts, that is to oughts expressed in statements like: ‘you ought not to be cruel to others’, ‘you ought not torture others for fun’, you ought to keep your promises’ and so on. If the instrumental ought is not based on desires, we can also assume that these oughts are not desire-based oughts.

            <Title>Four Objections from Naturalism</Title>
            <Text>Neo-Aristotelianism seems naturalistic enough 
 The generally accepted answer is yes. Thus, Rosalind Hursthouse:  “Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism—broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being.”Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics  p. 192.  Elizabeth Anscombe who ignited the modern revival of neo-Arisotetelianism in ethics offered virtue concepts as alternatives to inherently theistic concepts like law and absolutely binding obligation. 
Philippa Foot’s attitude to establishing her naturalistic credentials is far more sanguine. She merely aims to account for evaluations of humans as logically and grammatically identical to evaluations about animals and plants. (The influence of Wittgenstein can be clearly seen in her strong emphasis on natural language and her occasional lack of curiosity about metaphysics.) John McDowell avers that his brand of neo-Aristotelianism about ethics is naturalistic, though he is compelled to distinguish between a more reductive sort of naturalism and a more “relaxed” sort. 

Neo-Aristotelianism does not seem naturalistic enough 
	But “general acceptance” is not justification. Some have worried that a traditional virtue ethic and a thoroughgoing naturalism are incompatible or at least uneasy bedfellows. Some ethical naturalists are content to relegate all value to humanity (all value thought and talk) and leave it at that. I do not think this kind of “naturalizing” is in the spirit of naturalism. Naturalism it seems is more ambitious than to be content with just “basing ethics in some way on… human nature.” Can virtue ethics be harmonized with the naturalistic approaches? The worry can be teased out into four related objections. Each highlights a real or apparent tension between unmodified virtue ethics and unmodified naturalism. 
	1)	No Divinity Objection: Virtue ethics has been traditionally the purview of theists, from the divine nous of Aristotle to the divine logos of the Stoics to the divine Trinity of Aquinas, and orthodox naturalism tends to be atheistic, agnostic, or post-theist (apathetic).  If we come to believe that humans participate in the divine nous, are indwelt by a divine spark, or made in the image of God, it seems that we have left naturalism far behind. 
	2)	No Natural Teleology objection: Virtue ethics assumes or argues for teleology in nature, without which evaluations of living things including humans cannot get off the ground. An individual cactus or deer is evaluated by how well it instantiates the lifeform of its species. By contrast, Darwinism or neo-Darwinism is orthodox biology that is committed, it seems, to the view of disenchanted nature as a mono-causal order of efficient and material causation without final causation.  The orthodox “transformism” that has held majority sway since Darwin implies that lifeforms are essentially plastic or fluid, which entails that deviation from the norm may be a defect or simply a new adaptive mutation. Marinus Ferreira, “Reasons from Neo-Aristotelian Naturalism”   Stephen Brown articulates the objection that there may not even be a human lifeform, in which case the basis for ethical and other normative evaluations is gone. Stephen Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue”, Ethic@, Vol. 4., n. , P. 7-22, 2005.  
	3)	No Normative Human Nature objection: Virtue ethics also assumes that human nature or the human lifeform is so to speak normatively loaded. The very term virtue (a cognate of the Latin word for man) implies that humanity is a normative concept; a human can become fully human or inhuman. That is, one can fail to achieve one’s own humanity or one can become truly human.  Some ethical naturalists also put themselves at risk of this objection, when they ground normative facts and “queer” values in humanity as if that were enough. For instance, Hursthouse says hers is an  enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being”Hursthouse 193. Consequentialists try to demystify “queer” values by grounding them in humanity somehow (our interests, desires, judgments, evaluations, natural ends, etc.). The assumption is that human nature is “natural”, so if values are “humanized” then values become natural. But the shoe could fit the other foot. A critic could object that values are nonnatural so if values are humanized then human nature is nonnatural. Quite possibly, humanizing these mysterious values doesn’t naturalize them, but rather mystifies humanity. By contrast, “A fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature”.Brown 2004, p. 4. McDowell sees the parity between reason and practical reason, and so naturalizes both in “second nature.” Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. The point is that if humanity is discontinuous with nature then we seem to have a bi-furcated naturalism that violates the continuity of nature.
	4)	No Sui Generis Rationality Objection: Virtue ethics seems to elevate the status of humanity above other animals and perhaps the rest of nature. More specifically, it tends to make reason and practical reason special. For instance, Julia Annas asks: “Does …[a strong] relation between our rationality and the rest of our human nature as social animals give us a plausible form of naturalism? We might think not, if we think that the Aristotelian form is a plausible one. For it stresses continuities between the evaluative patterns in our lives and those that are to be found in the lives of plants and animals. The fact that we are rational animals makes a big difference…” Annas, “What kind of naturalism?” She notes that the more we emphasize our rationality, the less important appears that which we share with the rest of nature (our animality and materiality). She seems to endorse the stronger form of rationality despite the tension. Stephen Brown on the other hand is willing to bite the bullet that some or all of the normative authority of our rationality might be lost if we concede that humans are really continuous with plants and animals. He somewhat regretfully admits (while defending neo-Aristotelian naturalism!) that his uncompromisingly naturalistic virtue ethic “amounts to a kind of evolutionary ethics and, in the end, is fundamentally descriptive” Brown, Moral Virtue and Nature 1. He notes that the more we emphasize our common ancestry, our basic biological animality and (ultimately) origin of all living things in non-living chemicals and elements, the less important appears our normative rationality.  

	These four related worries individually and together pose a serious threat to neo-Aristotelianism. The threat is both dialectical and rhetorical, since they threaten the theory’s truth as well as (even if it is true) its palatability and plausibility to the thousands of philosophers who are naturalists. (Alternately, they pose a threat to naturalism, threatening to prove it false or make it seem implausible to neo-Aristotelians.)</Text>

            <Text>1. Target Debates featuring Confusions about Morality, Rationality, and Normativity

“These are normative concepts, concepts “fraught with ought”, as Wilfrid Sellars put it: moral concepts, concepts of rationality, concepts of the shameful or the enviable, of meriting credence or meriting aesthetic admiration, and other concepts.”Gibbard, Thinking how to live, x. 


Richard Boyd is an ethical naturalist. That is, he is the kind of ethical or moral realist who thinks moral terms refer and moral judgments are truth evaluable. But he thinks moral terms refer to natural facts and moral judgments are true just in case they correctly denote the natural facts. So, for example, a particular society’s law may be bad if, as a direct consequence of following that law, many people in the given society are deprived of adequate food. Certain kinds of natural objects (fruits, vegetables, etc.) are food for humans; and such food is, as a matter of natural fact, good for humans — it results in our surviving and living well. Laws that deprive people of adequate food deprive people of a good, and are themselves not good. 
Boyd doesn’t himself get into the details of what kinds of things are good or bad for people but I hope this is and example he would find in keeping with the spirit of his metaethical theory. 



The fact / value split is actually the split between descriptive facts and normative facts. 
Peter Schaber has argued that normative facts are what make true normative sentences true. The (correct) deliverances of practical reason also track reality, have a world-mind direction of fit — but they track normative facts rather than descriptive facts. One can intelligibly wonder, “I desire X, but ought I to desire X? Is X really desirable? Is it the kind of thing that people (or at least people like me) ought to desire?”

**Response to Christine Korsgaard, “The Authority of Reflection”**

## Introduction
## Thesis 
ource of obligation" and that "we have *moral* obligations... to humanity as such" (93).[^1]
## Arguments
### Autonomy is a source of obligation because we are reflective, accountable, have a self-conception, and have a “practical identity.”
So how can autonomy be a source of obligation for us qua human? Korsgaard’s answer is that our autonomy is the inevitable responsibility to set laws for our own practical actions and that such laws are authoritative for us. To justify this answer, a three observations are needed:  we as humans are *reflective*, we are *accountable*, and we have a *moral identity*. Let’s consider each in turn.
Korsgaard takes as axiomatic that "the human mind is self-conscious" (93). We have conscious mental states about the world; we also have mental states *about* our mental states. Call this *being reflective.*. 
Reflective agents like us are confronted "the problem of normativity." That is, we have the power (and therefore responsibility) of questioning our own actions and thoughts. We can and must hold ourselves *accountable*. We can and must demand justification for our actions. We can and must hold others accountable for their actions. Call this being *accountable*.
Also, reflective agents have a self-conception. In fact, we *have to* have a self-conception. The self-conception we have arises when "I" reflect on "myself", when I see myself as double, both the image in the mirror and the eyeballs looking at the mirror. The fact that we have a self-conception grounds the possibility of obligation and authority over myself by bifurcating the unitary self into the “thinking self” and the “acting self.” The thinking self cannot but regulate the acting self; the acting self cannot be be obligated to comply with those regulations. 
Reflectivity, accountability, and practical identity can be defined in terms of *reasons*. For example, suppose an agent desires to buy a new car. She then *reflects* on the desire: is there good reason to make the purchase or good reason to forestall that desire until later? When she has adequately been *accountable* for her decision by giving adequate reasons to herself, she acts. (Suppose, in this case, she waits on the purchase.) She is the kind of financially responsible person who does not waste money needlessly. Her action to wait on the big purchase expresses a practical identity. This example, I hope, shows why Korsgaard says ”’Reason' means reflective success" (94). To have a reason is to be in a position to *satisfy* the demands of accountability. And thus "reflective structure of human consciousness gives us authority over ourselves" (105). 
I need to say more about the notion of practical identities. This is the part of Korsgaard’s case that I find most interesting but also least clear. As I see it, her point is that we have many identities (human being, father, teacher, etc.) and that each defines certain practical activities.  But we also have a moral identity *as humans.* Humans "need to have practical conceptions of our identity in order to act and live" (106).  The fact is, we do act and live. Therefore we do have a moral identity. Korsgaard's argument she classifies as "transcendental" in this way. That we have a moral identity is something true we discover only upon reflection on our actual living and acting. Put another way, she says: “Rational action is possible only if human beings find their own humanity to be valuable” (104). 
Our self-conception "identifies us with the source of ... reasons. In this way, it makes us laws to ourselves" (100). Your identity is "a description under which you value yourself" (96). To really *be* a teacher (say) I must fulfill certain minimal obligations (grading student papers, respond to emails, show up to class). Korsgaard calls the person who lives up to his or her own standards a person with "integrity." Without integrity, the person *splits* into disunity. If I fail to live up to the obligations of being a teacher, I lose that part of my identity. 
But my identity as teacher is not the core of my moral identity -- the core of my moral identity is something more like my self-conception *as human being*. If my obligations qua human conflict with my obligations qua teacher, humanity will trump education. And if I fail to live up to my obligations qua human being, I lose my identity *tout court.* She says, "an obligation always takes the form of a reaction against a threat of a loss of identity" (97). Again, she says that some of our obligations arise simply from being human — I.e., being reflective and therefore accountable and having a practical identity. “That we obligate ourselves is simply a fact about human nature…” 100). 
Korsgaard’s discussion is more detailed than my summary can follow. I cannot do justice to the other way of putting the same points (the points about being reflective and accountable) — that we are free.[^2] Briefly, the will (which is for Kant practical reason) cannot be arbitrary — lacking reasons — nor can it be determined from “outside”, so it must be autonomous. Freedom, paradoxically, means obeying one’s own rules rather than obeying *no* rules or obeying the rules of another (God, the state, etc.). So Korsgaard endorses Kant’s notion that a categorical imperative — a purely formal universal law — is “the law of a free will” (95). I hope this somewhat paradoxical point is now clear. 
Nor can I do justice to the distinction she makes between the categorical imperative and the moral law. It is an important distinction for the upshot is this: just being persuaded that I am obligated by the categorical imperative doesn’t show that I am obligated by the moral law (96). 
To complete Korsgaard’s case that autonomy (rule of self over self) is the source of moral obligation she requires the additional point that the law you take for yourself be the *moral* law (rather than say, the law of egoism). 
Korsgaard concludes on the basis of these reflections that the “realist objection — that we need to explain why we must obey that legislator — has been answered, for this is a legislator whose authority is beyond question and does not need to be established” (98). A good maxim is one that we could will become a universal law. Good maxims, Korsgaard argues, are good in virtue of their formal or functional arrangement, their “internal structure” (99). Strangely, she concedes that (in this sense) realism is true, for the it is the properties of the maxim that determine its status as a good reason. But then she quickly takes it back — the epistemological point is that we discover what is a good reason by discovering *that we can endorse it*. 
To get to moral obligation, Korsgaard establishes a distinction between concepts and “conceptions.” A concept like good is simply, by definition, a “name for what we are to strive for, aim at, and care about…” while a *conception* of goodness falls out of our practical identity (100). An agent who takes up the standpoint of a citizen in the Kingdom of Ends gets out of that identity certain (substantive) conceptions of what she is to aim at. 
She simply asserts that convergence between “moral strangers”[@engelhardt1996foundations] on the need to have a view of what is right and good — and the sometime convergence of specific views on the right and good — is not due to a convergence “on an *external world* of objectively real values” (101). 
Her conclusion is that contingent, local practical identities like those urged by communitarians are rooted in *the* human, moral identity. “Most of the time, our reasons for action spring from our more contingent and local identities. But part of the normative force of those reasons springs from the value we place on ourselves as human beings who need such identities” (103). Humanity is to be valued for its own sake, and is implicitly valued in every other evaluation or evaluative reason for action. We can know our value only from *within* — from “the standpoint of reflective consciousness” (104). 
## Objections
**External Standard Objection** It might seem that autonomy cannot be the source of obligation. For the commonsense notion of obligation follows this pattern: an NFL football player is obligated to follow the rules of the game. These standards he did not create. If he violates a standard on a whim or with a malicious intention, appropriate consequences will follow (fines, suspension, etc.). Similarly, physical laws are not created by any humans. I am not "obligated" to "obey" physical laws, but there is an analogy here. The standards are not of my (or anyone's) making, so we cannot change them to our whims or intentions. Physical laws can be *ignored* but ultimately not *violated* -- if I refuse to acknowledge the coffee table between me and the door, appropriate consequences will follow (bruised shin). Perhaps moral laws are a kind of blend of these two: like physical laws, they are not man-made but "external"; however, like game rules, they *can* be violated (with consequences). Moral laws are not "optional" in the sense that a rational agent can "opt out" of them while remaining a rational agent, but they are optional in that an agent can willfully violate them. 
**External Standard Objection Reply** %
“The acting self concedes to the thinking self its right to government. And the thinking self, in turn, tries to govern as well as it can… and it is a relation not of mere power but rather of *authority*” (98).
**Stable Identity Objection** Korsgaard's account of obligations that arise from autonomy shows that obligations get their teeth from loss of identity entailed by violating them. For obligations arising not just from assigned jobs or voluntary roles but to simple and ultimate humanity, the loss of identity is simple and ultimate too. An objection she considers is that violating our obligations qua human *does not* in fact result immediately in the loss of our human identity. "Identity...cant take a few knocks, and we know it" (97).

This dissertation defense the thesis that human virtue and human values are not part of nature in the same way that nonhuman rocks and trees and animal brains are part of nature. 

If this thesis is right then either anti-realism is true or non-naturalism is true, but ethical naturalisms (of the extant variety) are unlikely to be true. I assume that anti-realism is false until the final chapter, in which I provide a few brief reasons to think the assumption is true. Non-naturalism I argue to be the most likely true explanation for our understanding of human value and virtue.

### Draft 2

This dissertation defense the thesis that virtue theory is the ethical framework with the most plausibility but that it is incompatible with the type of naturalism that is in 2014 is touted by 49 percent of analytic philosophers. The corollary of this thesis is that either virtue theory or such naturalism must be rejected. 

There are three kinds of people that might be interested in the arguments in favor of this thesis and against it, besides those who are generally is interested in ethics and meta-ethics. The first is philosophical naturalists who are on the hunt for a theory of morality that both takes morality seriously and rounds values and virtues and human happiness in nature. The second is those supernaturalists who are interested in arguments for virtue theory and wondered whether virtue theory is somehow aligned with a supernatural metaphysics. The third are virtue as assistants who might be wondering how their distinctly ethical theorizing connects with various broadly metaphysical frameworks.

### Draft 3

This dissertation defends the thesis that human virtue cannot be naturalized but that virtue talk is the best (most practically useful and theoretically plausible) kind of ethical theory we have. In this way, my  metaethical account that can be described as morally realist, non-naturalistic virtue ethics. 

There are two kinds of reasons to disbelieve my thesis. The first is allegedly more plausible alternative theories (or anti-theories) of morality: deontology, utilitarianism, moral nihilism of various stripes. The second is objections to my thesis. I shalI respond to each reason. But my responses will not be symmetrical. Regarding the first reason, evaluating the global persuasiveness and plausibility of a single ethical theory as a whole is hard work for one book, let alone all rivals to virtue ethics. So I shall content myself with identifying which plausibility points won by each side if it can explain a few, common, core judgments or values, like that friendship is a good thing, that is laudable to love and wonderful to be loved, and common assessments we make of admirable people. Regarding the second reason, I shall surface as many objections as I can find in the literature, learn from colleagues, and think up myself. I shall polish them up as well as possible and articulate them as sympathetically as possible and then, of course, do the hard work of refuting them as well as possible. 

My primary thesis is directed at those who already accept or lean toward virtue theory in general. For those, the reasons to accept virtue theory are redundant; for others, my reasons here to accept virtue theory are liable to be more tantalizing than persuasive. I shall point to the writings of a diverse group of virtue theorists— like Rosalind Hursthouse, Julia Annas, and John McDowell — who are different from each other in many ways but united about virtue. 

The question within virtue theory that I want to answer is this: can virtue theory be plausibly naturalistic? Are notions of virtue, happiness, flourishing, and notions of physicalism, naturalized epistemology and so on incompatible? Is neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism either Aristotelian or ethically naturalistic, but not both? I shall argue that they are incompatible. For many of naturalist orientation, this will decrease the global plausibility of virtue ethics. If the notions of virtue, along with honor, chastity, and slavery, are relics of the past, so much the worse for them. Naturalism is the philosophy of the future, for science is the philosophy of the future. But we cannot be too sanguine here. 

My secondary thesis is directed to just those who are undecided about virtue theory or already committed to one of it’s rivals. The global plausibility of virtue theory in light of a reasonable view of cosmology, politics, and psychology is very high indeed, as others before me have shown. But the global plausibility of naturalism is very high, as well. The tension between the two, if there is any tension, is cause for intellectual concern. Some naturalists have argued that the only alternative to moral realism is moral nihilism, which is such an unattractive position th

In order to make all of this tolerably clear, I shall have to define ‘naturalism.’ This is no easy task, and takes up a good bit of space in the chapter x. Naturalism we might call a movement. The momentum it has built, starting nearly 500 years ago, has crested and reached a kind of tipping point. Either naturalism will fulfill its promise of naturalizing not just the cosmos but everything else including mind and value, or naturalism will begin to ebb. Either the naturalists who have been hopeful of the research program in philosophy and outside it will make good on the last remaining pesky puzzles, or, to the astonishment of many, naturalism will prove to be not just incapable at the moment but incapable in principle of developing a comprehensive and satisfying account of both the cosmos and the mind. 



###Draft 4
This dissertation defends the thesis that virtue is a gift of God. As Plato suggested in Meno, the source of human virtue is not humanity or nature but something outside both humanity and nature. This thesis must be distinguished from a thesis in the vicinity — a thesis much debated in popular forums — about whether one can be “good without God.” I think this is like asking whether a gardener can grow plants without the sun. The answer is the gardener needs sunlight but need not believe in the sun to grow plants. Similarly, if virtue is a gift from God, then the virtuous person needs help but need not believe in the Helper to live virtuously and benefit others. 


###Draft 5

This dissertation advances the thesis that all extant ethical naturalisms are false. The corollaries of this thesis are that we must either elect for ethical non-naturalistic virtue and do so very soon, or else wait perhaps a long time some yet-to-be-defined articulation or yet-to-be-conceived conception of ethical naturalism. 

Chapter 1 reviews some of the primary discussions and attempts plausible definitions of some what are called ‘Keywords’ in the debate between naturalists and non-naturalists over ethics, including ‘nature, ‘good,’ ‘virtue’, and ‘human’, ‘practical reason,’ ‘telos,’ and ‘science’. 

Chapter 2 advances a positive version of virtue ethical theory that provides strong explanatory power over a range of moral platitudes, namely, entrenched folk moral views that seem so right, and why some sophisticated moral theories seem so wrong. Family is important. Friendship is valuable. Cruelty is wrong. The question of whether this virtue theory is ‘naturalistic’ is deferred. And the motivation for a naturalistic theory of ethics is highlighted. Some criteria for what our ethical theory should account for are negotiable (say, that my ethical theory should explain why I am always right and others wrong) and, after reflection, ought to be given up. The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are: 

1. **Action** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport; norms are action-guiding; practical reason gives reasons for practice -- that is, rational action rather than static reason and irrational activity. explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons. 
2. **Character** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials.
3. **Diverse Finite Goods** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest);
4. **Heroic Virtue **- accounting for how some exemplary good people become so good; 
5. **Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** —  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others;
6. **Diverse Normativity** — explaining the parity between epistemic and moral norms (in contrast to the absence of a parity between etiquette norms or preferences);

Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. 

Chapter X begins a critique of neo-Aristotelian naturalisms.  Aristotelian naturalism of a more phenomenological flavor proposed by Philippa Foot is critiqued. The  Aristotelian naturalism with a scientific flavor proposed by Stephen R. Brown is also examined. The problem of the fact value dichotomy is not overcome by asserting that some of human biology sets normative limits for human flourishing, happiness, and virtue. To speak adequately of all of human flourishing requires speaking of our rational nature and our biology as a union. The metaphysical problem with virtues being my virtues if personal identity has no further grounding than biology is urged. 

Chapter x critiques the “third alternative” between supernaturalism and reductive naturalism as espoused by Rosalind Hursthouse and John McDowell. The third way is a kind of groundless intersubjectivism wherein no further grounding is required, a non-transcendental idealism that avoids the myth of givenness (that some empirical truths come for free without any interference from our intellect) and the myth of objectivity (that some intellectual truths come for free without any help from our senses). The problem of moral nihilism rears its head. 

Chapter x rehearses criticism of various ethical naturalisms, beginning with non-cognitivist naturalism. If virtue ethical moral realism demands supernaturalism, then perhaps it is better to deny realism in general. But non-cognitivism (except expressivism) collapse into moral nihilism, which is not only implausible, but in light of primary, substantive normative and moral questions, morally reprehensible. Expressivism, albeit much more sophisticated and hard to exactly critique, collapses into a kind of ethical skepticism or nihilism that is inconsistent especially with Criterion 4. 

Chapter x critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the non-scientific flavor, where the good (say) is an ethical/natural property saliently different from other kinds of natural properties. It then critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the scientific flavor, where the good and other values are ethical/natural properties not saliently different from other natural properties like natural kinds. These fail to account for Criterion 3 and 4. 

Chapter x answers a few remaining objections, and considers whether (if no satisfying theory of ethical naturalism currently exists) it would be better to trust naturalism and wait for an ethical theory some day, or trust our ethical theory and abandon naturalism today, or very soon. In light of the ambiguity of the term naturalism, this final chapter concludes with some suggested re-conceptualizations of the five Keywords. 




### Draft 6

That we ought to love each other is true if anything is true. Life as lived is puzzling. Among the many puzzles that confront us, some of the most enduringly fun and bewildering are ethical puzzles about how we know what is good and whether there is a good at all.  These questions are given a special bite. 

This dissertation advances a naturalistic metaethical theory that combines moral realism and virtue theory. My thesis involves three claims: that nature consists of some normative facts and other facts in a radical continuity, that at least some those facts can be and in some cases are known, and that knowing and acting on them is (for rational creatures like us) the best way to live.

The question of naturalism will occupy much of our discussion. And it will take us into the *metaphysical* side of metaethical debates. I for one enjoy the variety of discussants and styles across philosophical metaphysicians and ethicists, but some may find the presence of so much metaphysical discussion strange alongside so much ethical discussion. 

Normative ethical theories (about duty, virtue, pleasure, the divine will, etc.) are normally taken to be competing and non-trivially distinct from metaethical theories about what grounds duties, virtues, human pleasure, God's decrees, etc. This received wisdom is wise. And yet, to paraphrase Thomas Nagel, sanity in our metaethics is most preserved by keeping primary ethical concerns near to our mind.

Explanations explain phenomena that puzzle us. There are, in many cases, competing explanations that can't both be true but that are both plausible. If I find a broken window in my home office and a stick on the ground, on the face it may be that some neighborhood menace was breaking windows for fun, or that my tree outside lost a branch in the wind. An explanation is (always?) underdetermined by the data. 
 
There are two ways to offer an explanation: as an argument (contending against others) or as a framework (aiming for consistency and coherency and plausibility). When offering the first kind of explanation qua argument it is necessary to attack other frameworks and defend one's own. When offering the second kind of explanation it is necessary to fully explicate the theory, drawing out aspects and clarifying or defending them. The plausibility of a framework then depends, for the reader, on how plausible and satisfying the framework is as a whole rather than the relatively less satisfying alternatives.

There are two ways the reader might take my main claim: firstly, as a query about virtue ethics, whether it can be naturalistic or not; secondly, as a query about ethical naturalism, whether it can be made plausible or not. Admittedly these questions are distinct and can be treated separately. But insofar as writers like Hursthouse, Foot, and McDowell address them as a result, I shall follow suit. 

One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocuters, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproarioiusly funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocuters are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergradutes are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to let the dead bury their own dead. 

While writing a platonic dialogue is a form of art I still find appealing and still use, that is not the best vehicle for this dissertation. So I am forced to give the views I think mistaken the best hearing I can give them in my own voice. 

The challenge of metaethical inquiry, I think, is to engage readers who do not already agree with you. A constant danger to which we are all liable is assuming too many crucial propositions and arguging at length about a bunch of relatively peripheral propositions. Metaethicists who steer clear of this danger are the likes of Alan Gibbard and Robert Adams. There is some value to articulating, clarifying, and defending a view that reader and author both (already) share. But that is not the valuable enterprise I aim for. 

The test, I think, shall be whether these pages find readers who disagree with the core thesis I present in Chapter 3, and, if so, whether they can recognize "their own" purported view in the pages that follow. If they can not only recognize but resoundingly affirm the view expressed in that chapter, then my objections may have some bite and may earn the high honor of receiving a rebuttal. 

It would not be a failure if no one found these pages; most such essays do not find readers, even if they deserve them. Failure would be for some ethical naturalist to pick up the book or a chapter on a shelf or online, glance at the view expressed, and to disown what I claim is his own. 

I have done my best within the following chapters to detail my assumptions as quasi-axioms or quasi-data to be examined and explained. I have also done my best to formalize (in short, numbered, propositional forms) the arguments I endeavor to lay out and defend in paragraphs. The benefit of offering formalized versions of my own arguments is that they may clarify for readers exactly what is being offered for their consideration. The risk of offering proposition-unit versions that are shorter than the paragraph-unit versions is that some discrepancy may arise between the two, and the readers be forced to do an initial interpretive work of figuring out exactly which argument they ought to consider. 

My theses are these:

1. There exist some real primary norms (both epistemic and ethical) that are binding on us *qua* human beings. 
2.  These norms are in some cases, knowable and effable. 

Examples of such norms are 'proportion your belief to the evidence' and 'be kind to others.' 

If such norms are 'real' then they are mind-independent, true regardless of human opinion, etc. 

If they are 'binding on us qua human beings' then they truly prescibe over all creatures with practical rationality -- in other words, all creatures like us and all other potential creatures we might discover or be discovered by one day. 

I say 'some real norms' because, of course, not all norms are real. Norms of, say, spelling English words I take to be purely or mostly conventional. Drawing up lists of exactly which norms are real independent of human thought and which are human concepts is of course a difficult task. My task is simply to defend that the list of mind-independent norms has at least one item. 

The main rivals to the above theses are epistemic and moral nihilists, expressivists, and error theorists.  Some say such norms just don't exist except as concepts or social structures. Others say that if such norms existed they do not explain how we think and talk. So the arguments that such norms really exist are metanormative explanations of the way we talk, the way we act, and the we we (necessarily) think. 

But even among those who agree with the above theses are divided. Not everyone who agrees with the first two agree with each other. These norms seem to defy fact/value distinctions. They are evaluative facts, or factual prescriptions. At least, if they are "just values" then the fact/value gap becomes a problem. If they are fact-values then there is no gap to be overcome. But some philosophers become indignant at the notion of evaluative facts: what in the world could such strange things be? 

This leads to the question of whether ethical norms are 'natural'?  Are moral facts, or what I am calling simply 'norms' natural? This seems like a pressing and substantive question whose answer will affect alot. After doing the research for this dissertation, I no longer think it is a pressing or substantive question. It is not just vague but hopelessly vague; not just ambiguous but fatally ambiguous. 

4. Are these norms "natural"?
	* Are these norms radically anamolous? Are they strange, queer, discontinuous? 
	* Are such norms physical/material? (Nagel, McDowell)
	* Are such norms divine? 
5. Where do such norms come from? Do they happen to emerge from our biology? Do they come from the mouth of a god? Are they necessary features of our rational nature and other other creatures with a rational nature? 

My claim is that: 

1. These norms are 'natural' but that the question 'Is X natural?' is almost vacuous. 
	* These norms are not radically anomolous. They are not strange, queer, discontinous.  (Nagel)
	* These norms are not material. (Nagel, McDowell)
	* These norms are not emergent properties arising from our biology. (Foot, Brown)
5. These norms are internally related to human nature (via practical rationality). (Foot, McDowell, Kant)

For the purpose of these essays, I remain agnostic as to whether these norms come from any particular personal god. But I do claim that they are divine. The contrast is likely to strike the reader as strange. By 'divine' I mean that they transcend our animal biology and that conformity to them makes us rational, acting creatures full of wisdom and virtue.  Affirming the divinity of some norms is consonant with a variety of theistic views: Aristotle's god is neither Brahman nor Jehovah. 

But insofar as 'natualist' is just a label for 'atheist,' then my argument entails that naturalism is false. But I deny the charge that my view is "non-naturalistic." Insofar as 'naturalist' is a label for 'one who believes in the radical continuity of facts, the uniformity and harmony of reality,' I vehemently claim the label as my own. In order to claim the label as my own, I must show that they are mistaken who think reality is radically continuous because reality is fundamentally physical or material. 

The best evidence that reality is not fundamentally material is human nature, rationality and practical rationality, including primary norms. 


###### Draft 7

This dissertation defends the claim that some moral and epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents, and that such norms are best explained in terms of human nature (what we are), human flourishing (our end), and human virtues which are the means to flourishing. 

There is a danger that labels, which are useful for categorization, storage, and quick reference of arguments and beliefs, become more important than substantive arguments. Let me say here how I would label my view in terms of the labels fashionable in the early 2000s, and thereafter avoid trivial disputes. I take my metaethical view to be a brand of normative realism, emphasizing moral norms but using epistemic norms as allies. I take my ethical view to be a brand of virtue ethics. Talk about virtues, human nature, and flourishing or happiness I find the most helpful in solving knotty metaethical puzzles. Sometimes, as Thomas Nagel reminds me, the only solution to metaethical puzzles is to stick to primary ethical tools. 

The main rivals to my claim are: (a) the belief that no moral or epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents; or and a group of views (b) that such norms are indeed real but best understood in other terms. There are several rivals of this second class. In order of decreasing similarity to my own conclusion, beginning with *most* similar, they are: 


|Rival claim | Thinker | Label |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|
| b1. Real norms are best understood as features of our human nature  | (McDowell) |Ethical naturalism
| b2. Real norms are best understood as features of our rational minds | (Kant) | Ethical Rationalism
| b3. Real norms are best understood as features of our social group | (MacIntyre?)| Social construct
| b4. Real norms are best understood as features of our animal nature | (Foot)| Naturalism
| b5. Real norms are best understood as features of the "natural world" |(Boyd)| Ethical naturalism

It will be quickly noticed that several of these views fly under the heading of 'naturalism'.  

Hence I move to dispense with the titles. Instead, clarifying the claims, I shall argue for and against each claim in its own terms. In the final chapter I shall pick up the question of labels and definitions, again, after the dust has settled. 

There are a series of questions to which the best answer is "there are real norms or laws of thought and behavior that govern creatures like us." I lay out [a number] of criteria for what an adequate metaethical theory should explain. These criteria are, I hope, non-controversial, eminently common phenomena that we can all relate to. 

My first task in defending my primary thesis *could have been* to rehearse some of the arguments against normative nihilism, norm expressivism, etc. Instead, I shall argue that normative realism is a reasonable "defeasible presumption"[^14] that we ought to trust unless weighty objections arise. I then show that 'naturalism' provides exactly such weighty objections. But 'naturalism' is a a "philosopher's weasel-word."[^15] A naturalistic thesis, when clarified, will turn out to be one of a few kinds of thesis: 

[^15]:  Borrowing Terrence Cuneo's term from *The Normative Web*. 

* a trivial common sense metaphysical thesis; -- all that is real is real 
* a slightly less trivial anti-idealist metaphysical thesis; -- all that is material is real
* a universal reductive materialist thesis;  -- all that is real is material; nothing that is real is non-material
* or an atheistic thesis; -- nothing that is real is supernatural (i.e., God) [^16]

[^16]: Some might think that the reductive materialist thesis is for all intents and purposes identical to the atheistic thesis. But idoloters think that their god is material and pantheists think that matter too is god. 

So I reframe the so-called 'naturalists objection' in these three ways. The core objection I call the "argument from radical discontinuity."  The argument from radical discontinuity, or disharmony, finds various expressions in various books and articles but has, I think, one root. That root is important and true. I show how my account satisfies that search for radical continuity. So how does my account fare with respect to so-called naturalism, after disambiguation? I detail how my account 

*  agrees with 'naturalism' qua trivial metaphysical thesis; 
* disagrees with 'naturalism' qua reductively materialistic thesis
* does not disagree with 'naturalism' qua atheistic thesis. 

	It is indeterminate with respect to theism or atheism, though it fits better with theism. (My account makes theism more plausible and atheism less plausible. But it is not inconsistent with atheism nor does it entail theism. I call such a weak relationship a "fit" but indeterminate.)

	Some will find it strange that I argue for *holiness* without necessarily invoking religion, or *divinity* without necessarily attaching it to a god. It is strange, but not uncommon. Laozi's eternal Tao is divine without being a god. Aristotle's *nous* is a god without being a person. Even Kant's Christian God is not quite Swinburne's Christian God, with purposes, plans, and personality. I take my argument to be a conclusion about signs. The nature and reality of the signified is a whole different discussion. Could someone, beginning from the existence of a sign that most clearly points to a signified, make an argument that the signified in fact exists? Yes. Could someone else deny the signified, reinterpreting the sign? Yes. But both acknowledge and admit the existence and nature of the sign, including that it seems to point beyond itself. That's all I can hope for here. 
	

With these clarifications in hand, I proceed to examine the various rival views as espoused by their best proponents.  They all accept the reality of evaluative norms but explain them differently, offering different metaphysical frameworks and anthropological frameworks. I attempt to show in detail how each rival either misteps or goes only part of the way in the right direction. It misteps by invalidating one of our criteria. It only goes part of the way by only including some of our criteria, ignoring or disregarding the others. 

Moral realism is a defeasible presumption. That means it's true that there are moral facts until we can prove that it's false with a really sound objection. Naturalism claims to provide such a really sound objection.

 The objection is that values are just too different from facts. I call this the "disharmony" objection or the "radical discontinuity" objection. The feeling is that, at bottom, all of reality must have a commonality and unity to it. All the various *realities* must connect up somehow. This feeling is, I believe, behind Darwin's search for a common ancestor for all the multitudinous life forms we see on the earth (not to mention in the fossil record). Why else would anyone, aware that there are billions of beatles, birds, whales, marmots, guanamos, gnats, elephants, and dogs even *think* of searching for one organism that -- however long ago -- is their universal parent?  
 
 Thomas Nagel has said that the apparent discontinuity between "objective" and "subjective" -- and exploring the two-- defines almost all his works.[^16] Stephen Brown says that a "fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature" (Brown 2008, 4). 
 [^16]: Nagel thinks that the two perspectives are irreconciable. Our best bet is detached, disinterested awareness of both perspectives. When affirming one seems to make impossible affirming the other? Affirm the paradox. 
 
 On this objection, if values are different from facts, if moral facts are so different from nonmoral facts, then something must be wrong. 
 
Their are a variety of available responses to the dissonance objection. One is to give up naturalism: 

* Moral facts are nonnatural but they're real, so get used to it. Reality just turns out to have two fundamentally different and in a sense irreconciable kinds of facts. This is G.E. Moore's and Shaffer-Landeau's choice.  
*  Another is to give up moral realism. Nature is real; values are not natural (or they're just too different from the natural) so these putative values or moral facts have got to go. This is Mackie, Ayer, and Gibbard, Blackburn et. al., 
*  A third way is a spectrum of negotiations and compromises with naturalism that each attempt to keep as much moral realism as possible while doing as much justice as possible to our respect for science. This third way is what I am interested in. It's not that I do not see how one could give up moral realism, I just cannot do it. I find it psychologically impossible to live as if it *might* be OK for me to, rather than feed and clothe and educate my kids, to put them in a freezer. [^15]

For instance, we could say that only nature is real and only what is natural can be known but argue that values and moral facts and so on are natural. But what do we mean by natural? 

* Could mean that values are endemic to human nature, to humans, and that humans are natural. Examples: John McDowell, Philippa Foot.  
* We could mean that values are features of the natural world just like natural kinds. Example: Richard Boyd. 
* Values could be natural the way that health is natural and anything that produces health. Example: Paul Bloomfield.
* Still others might argue that values are natural that supervene on normal natural facts the same way psychological fax super being on normal physical facts. Example: Frank Jackson.


But the fundamental tension between "inside" and "outside" might itself be a misunderstanding. That seems to be one of John McDowell's main points. 

What if the objection from discontinuity or dissonance is misguided? It seems that "science" supports reductive materialist metaphysics but what if our "respect for natural science" demands nothing of the sort? Then the objection against realism weakens. And its inherent plausibility and truly amazing explanatory power shines forth again unabated. 

###Demystifying values as "just part of human nature"
Some try to naturalize values by just putting them all  (or discovering them all) within humans. I don't think this strategy works. It doesn't demystify values, it re-locates the msytery. If all these mysterious non-factual value thingies floating around with no apparent connection or meaning in the natural world are all somehoe internal to human nature, and humans are natural, then all those values are natural, right? Yes, or human nature has just become non-natural. We used to have a "fact/value" split but now we have a "fact/human" split. 

To see how human rising values doesn't demystify values that actually makes humans mysterious, consider the cycle of euphemism. A phenomenon like human fecal matter is impolite to talk about. So we invent a euphemism like "feces." The euphemism works for referring to the same stuff without impoliteness for awhile. Then some kids get ahold of the term, realize what it means, and (having no taste) find it uproariously funny. They make enough jokes to *impolitisize* the polite term, shucking its dignified veneer. We invent another euphemism like "scat". To my knowledge, no one has yet turned "scat" into an exclamation expressing surprise or disapproval.  

To his credit, McDowell sees the parity of epistemic and moral norms. He wants to subjectivize moral norms, so he accordingly subjectivizes epistemic norms. Virtue and reason are *both* transcendental idealized processes, intersubjective human processes, objective enough for our purposes and to explain the objective purport in our thinking, feeling, and acting, but subjective enough to respect the distinction between human nature ("second nature") and *nature* nature (primary nature). 

Even so, second nature remains radically discontinuous from primary nature. Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. 


Having removed the teeth from the overriding motivation to be "naturalistic", these rival views turn out simply to be half-hearted substitutes for virtue. They are not even properly "rivals" nor are they clear-headed. The clear-headed work to be done is to clarify objections to virtue theory and articulate better answers and explanations. 

Finally, I consider objections that might show my claim to be false or otherwise inadequate (implausible, trivial, or useless). The biggest of these is that my conclusion does not "secure" the natural world from "outside" influence. The fear can be variously expressed: *You have not protected us from god.* Since I do not think that such laws are circuscribed to *humans*, the fear that there may be something or someone *else* out there -- be they aliens, angels, or gods -- is not a fear that should disturb our rational reflection on these questions. I reflect on the relation between my claim and theism. 

The conclusion of all this is that some kind of virtue theoretical account is not only truest but most useful. My claim, if true, helps to vindicate the excellent work in virtue ethics that is being done all over the world. It also vindicates the practical work of those leaders, parents, politicians, medical doctors, pastors, and professors, who deploy terms like 'virtue' and 'happiness' to motivate themselves and others in their care. 

The essays comprising this dissertation unfortunately defy categorization. The normative considerations in the first and last chapters might be called applied ethical. After all, we are trying to give good reasons and hear good reasons for our metaethical theory in order to *know* what to do with our ethical theories, and we care about our ethical theories (in part) because we care about our lives. We want to lie well, not badly. The "metaphysics of ethics" we must do (in response to Kant and Frank Jackson) to get a hold on human nature and the norms to which we are naturally sensitive requires a bit of metaphysical legwork. And, of course, there will inevitably be some room for moral epistemology, semantics, and moral motivation. With the great danger ever present that on any of these various topics I will mistep, I trust in the reader not to scoff but to correct, not to laugh but to help me learn.  

#### Draft 7.5

Moral realism is a defeasible presumption. That means it's true that there are moral facts until we can prove that it's false with a really sound objection. Naturalism claims to provide such a really sound objection.

 The objection is that values are just too different from facts. I call this the "disharmony" objection or the "radical discontinuity" objection. The feeling is that, at bottom, all of reality must have a commonality and unity to it. All the various *realities* must connect up somehow. This feeling is, I believe, behind Darwin's search for a common ancestor for all the multitudinous life forms we see on the earth (not to mention in the fossil record). Why else would anyone, aware that there are billions of beatles, birds, whales, marmots, guanamos, gnats, elephants, and dogs even *think* of searching for one organism that -- however long ago -- is their universal parent?

Theoretical Reason is also normative

	“There is, however, a different way of understanding the contrast between practical and theoretical reason, stressing the parallels rather than the differences between the two forms of reflection. According to this interpretation, theoretical reflection too is concerned with a normative rather than a factual question, namely with the question of what one ought to believe. It attempts to answer this normative question by assessing and weighing reasons for belief, the considerations that speak for and against the particular conclusions one might draw about the way the world is. Furthermore, it does this from a standpoint of first-personal reflection: the stance of theoretical reasoning in this sense is the committed stance of the believer, not the stance of detached contemplation of one's beliefs themselves (Moran 2001). Seen in this way, the contrast between practical and theoretical reason is essentially a contrast between two different systems of norms: those for the regulation of action on the one hand, and those for the regulation of belief on the other.”R. Jay Wallace, “Practical Reason”. 

If this is so, then the realm of normativity just is the realm of rationality. And I believe it is so. The reader must decide if the reasons for thinking all this is so.  I for one follow the argument and conclude that the realm of normativity is the realm of rationality (both theoretical and practical). 


Normativity includes but is not limited to morality
If the fundamental puzzle behind puzzles about morality (whether moral facts exist, whether moral knowledge is the same as other kinds of knowledge, whether moral terms refer, whether moral considerations are necessarily motivating) is a puzzle about normativity then those philosophers (like me) who are playing the metaethical game have to get into the metanormativity game. 

An objection
One worry might be that expanding conversations about morality to include all of normativity might explode the conversation beyond unwieldy limits.James Lenman suggested as much to me in a personal correspondence. Moral and especially metaethical conversations are already expansive and complicated enough, one might object (with more than a hint of exasperation). While I am sympathetic to this worry, the change I am arguing we ought to make is not a just change in scope (and therefore size) of the conversation; it is a change in qualitative classification. If we fail to make the change, the result will not be accounts of manageable size but incorrect accounts. Moral questions just are normative questions; one’s moral theory cannot coherently discriminate between “moral normativity” and “non-moral normativity”, giving one explanation for moral reality, knowledge, and language but giving an unrelated or contrasting explanation for other kinds of normativity (rational or aesthetic). But that is just what Boyd and Gibbard do.  

Kant
Now, I do not consider myself a Kantian. Kant is one of those philosophers, like Plato and Aquinas, where it’s hard to know what to do with him unless you take him as your master. It’s hard to know how to agree with this or that particular thesis, how to even understand the terms of the thesis, without being obliged to untangle nested web of connected theses, terms, and doctrines. As an example of what I mean, Kant (as I read him) avers that reason judges (and in part constructs) reality, while practical reason produces laws and maxims. Insofar as Kant argues that practical reason exists, I agree with him. He also argues that practical reason is free, and that we can somehow know that God and immortality exist because freedom exists and morality. It is not a critique of Kant’s philosophy to say I can’t follow it — it is a critique of myself. But I can’t follow all that. 

Regardless, for Kant, practical reason is the realm of moral law and also freedom. That much (if I follow it) I agree with. We only deliberate about what to do because it is not determined (in precise detail) ahead of time what we will do. And we are free to do wrong, that is, we can elect for irrational action. Of course, irrational action is by definition not free, not in accord with law. So we cannot act both irrationally and freely. We can only act freely by acting rationally. And we can only act rationally by acting in accord with maxims we can will universally. 

The thing to do is the good thing
Reducing “goodness” to a merely “moral” sense inevitably gives rise to puzzles about internalism and externalism regarding motivation. “X is wrong, but should I do it anyway?” “Y is good, but I don’t want to do it.”
But the “good” is, according to Socrates’ dictum just by definition that for the sake of which we perform every action. 


The conclusion
Regardless of the relation of my thesis to Kant’s overall critical idealism. I think the lesson is that when we are looking for reasons we might find reasons to think p and not to think that f or reasons to φ and not to π.  That is because normativity (the realm of “oughts”) just is the realm of rationality (the realm of reasons). If this is right, metaethics will stall until we learn this lesson. </Text>

            <Title>## 3 Natural Norms</Title>
            <Text>Introduction

Is normativity natural? Are normative facts part of nature?  In this paper, I make a brief case for an affirmative answer. 
In the first section, I present a presumptive argument for natural normativity. Normative truths can be expressed in Aristotelian Categorical statements of the form all A’s φ. The existence of natural normative facts is best explanation of two other natural facts, both wrapped up in apparent teleology or end-directed phenomena. 
In the second section, I present a battery of seemingly devastating objections to the existence of objective natural norms. Not only does one risk mockery when flying in the face of current philosophical orthodoxy, but some substantive scientific and philosophical objections seem devestating. I argue that these arguments against natural normativity persuade with suggestion more than substance. By contrast, the evidence for natural normativity is fairly obvious, and the traditional explanations can be articulated with a high degree of sophistication, coherence. 
In the third section, since my idiosyncratic interest in natural norms arises partly from my research in metaethics, I conclude by discussing one possible implication of natural normativity within ethical and metaethical conversations. 
In this paper, I draw from eclectic sources, but most from Aristotle, Philippa Foot, and Thomas Nagel. I take my readings of Aristotle and Nagel to be fairly standard; my reading of Foot, on the other hand, extends a bit farther into metaphysical speculation than she herself (following Wittgenstein) is interested in going. I take my thesis to be naturalistic in the broad sense: I am using philosophical and broadly scientific methods in an attempt to observe and explain natural phenomena, and bracketing divine revelation or the existence of supernatural beings. Furthermore, my thesis is naturalistic in that one important governing assumption of ethical naturalism is that humans are continuous with nature (Brown 2009). This naturalism I shall use to push back against one kind of objection. 

Norms
First, what is a normative fact? A normative fact “is what corresponds to a true normative statement” (Schaber). For reasons of space, I shall ask you to join me in simply assuming normative realism. So, value-statements, reason-statements, and ought-statements are refer to different norms. (I will use “norm” and “normative fact” interchangeably). “You ought not hit strangers with a skateboard” is a moral statement, but obviously, not every ought is a moral ought (Thomson 2001). “You ought to drink some hot lemonade” is a prudential norm (Thomson 2001). Drinking the hot lemonade is something you aspire to, rather than a description of how you are behaving. If you do not, your throat may remain sore. Importantly, not every norm uses the word ‘ought’. For example, “Eyes are for seeing,” is a description of their function, purpose, or the end-directed activity of that system. “Eyes are for seeing” is a normative and descriptive statement — that’s what eyes do and what they ought to do. Eyes that cannot see are defective qua eye. “Wolves hunt in packs” is a normative and descriptive statement. 

The basic thesis
So, the basic structure of the argument is this: there are two phenomena, two natural facts, that are best explained by the reality of natural normativity. If those two natural facts are real, then norms are part of nature, nature is normative. 
Consider those two natural facts: the first is end-directed (teleonomic) behavior of natural entities (eyes see, trees grow, stomachs digest); the second is the essentially normative (teleological) cognitive and practical activity of natural humans. The best explanation of each of these facts, and of both together, is that nature is normative.  By nature is normative, we could also say that there are natural teleological laws, natural norms, final causes, natural ends, natural functions. 

Aristotelian Categoricals 
“Wolves ought to hunt in packs” is a statement Foot calls an Aristotelian Categorical (Foot 2002). An Aristotelian categorical is a statement of logical form neither universal nor particular. That is, to assert that all A’s φ is not to distribute φ-ing to all members of the category A, nor simply to assert that some A’s that we have observed were observed φ-ing. 
For example, “all reptiles lay eggs” as universal categorical statement admits no exceptions.  The discovery of a new reptile, say, that gives live birth would not be the discovery of a defective reptile, but a discovery of a new species of reptile. Or rather, it would mean that either this newly discovered creature is not a reptile or that not all reptiles lay eggs. On the other hand, modestly confining oneself to a particular categorical statement like “some reptiles lay eggs” would be radically unambitious science. Our sample size of reptiles that lay eggs is enormous; we are justified in making the inductive leap that all reptiles lay eggs. 
Aristotelian Categoricals, then, are neither simply universal nor simply particular categorical descriptions. They are normative/descriptive judgments. And they are also formed by observation and induction. For example, we observe that many As do indeed φ, and we infer that A is supposed to φ, A is for φ-ing.  Categorical are inductive generalizations with a normative character.  We have observed a sample of A’s φ-ing and we inductively infer that (perhaps) all A’s φ. On the basis of the generalization, the observation that a particular A does not φ does not refute a simply, universal predication but identifies a defect in that particular A. When we observe an exception to a categorical we do not ipso fact debunk our categorical nor are obliged to re-interpret our observation. When learn that all wolves (say) hunt in packs, and observe a wolf hunting alone, we do not debunk the principle that wolves hunt in packs. (Nor do we think that we have discovered a new species of canine that is morphologically and genetically identical to a wolf!) Rather, we have observed that not all wolves are doing what they are supposed to do, not all wolves perfectly exemplify their lifeform.

A Presumptive Case for Natural Teleology
The presumptive case of natural teleology is this. 

	A. Argument for Normative Facts

	1)	If a normative statement is true, it corresponds to a normative fact. (Normative realism)
	2)	Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement. (From observation and induction). 
	3)	Therefore, eyes are for seeing corresponds to a normative fact. (From 1-2)

	B. Argument for Natural Normative Facts. 

	1)	Further, if a normative statement is true about natural entities, then there are natural normative facts. 
	2)	Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement about a natural entity. 
	3)	Therefore, there are natural normative facts. 

Argument (A) assumes normative realism for premise 1.  We learn premise 2 from observation and induction: an Aristotelian Categorical descriptive/normative statement: Eyes are for seeing (stomachs are supposed to digest, wolves hunt in packs, humans ought to think rationally, or what have you). (I) delivers conclusion (3), that there are normative facts. Then, argument (B) provides a simple variation on (A). True normative statements about natural entities correspond to real natural facts. Such normative facts are natural and not merely human, psychological, or projected. And (2) is, I take it, obviously normative and about a natural entity (not something man-made). So (B) delivers our thesis, that there are natural normative facts. 

Objections: It seems that nature is not normative
Let’s consider just a few of the powerful objections to this line of thinking. 
	1.	The first objection is that it is false that eyes are for seeing. Some will say, “Eyes that do not see died out; eyes that see were preserved naturally.” 
	⁃	As far as I can tell, evolutionary backstories about what eyes are and what eyes do has nothing to do with whether they have a real, end-directed function. There is disagreement about whether explanations undermines or underwrites teleological explanations (Brown 2009). All that I need for my argument to work is that possibly evolutionary backstories underwrite natural teleology. The only reason to assume that natural selection is undirected by natural teleology is dogma. If so, call me a heretic. 
	⁃	But is it really possible to doubt that eyes are for seeing? That eyes see is an empirical observation. That eyes ought to see, that eyes that cannot see are defective, is, I insist, equally empirical. It is just as empirical and no more theory-laden than other scientific observations like “all reptiles lay eggs.” 
	⁃	I save one more response to this objection in the last objection.
	2.	A second objection is to cling to an image. On one very powerful picture of the world, nature is a realm of pure descriptive facts. Nature is “bald”, “disenchanted,” and purely physical (McDowell 1996). Nature is an interlocking system of relations, spatial, temporal, and causal. Nature is “the world of quantity, as against the world of quality; of objects as against consciousness… of that which knows no values as against that which both has and perceives value; of efficient causes (or, in some modern systems, of no causality at all) as against final causes.” (Lewis 1943). Some call this the Laplacian picture (Plantinga 2011). On the Laplacian picture, norms are final causes, teloi, ways, and hence must be merely psychological. The Laplacian picture is the scientific picture of nature. So the assertion of norms is unscientific.  
	⁃	By all means, let us be scientific. I have an unwavering pro-attitude toward whatever earns the honorific title of science. If teleological laws are not discovered by scientific methods, then normative facts remain mere hypotheses or pragmatic assumptions or unshakable illusions. But the fact that eyes really are for seeing disproves the Laplacian picture of science. Natural normativity is scientific, and its denial is unscientific. It is empirical, and its denial is dogmatic.  
	3.	A third objection. The existence of natural teleology depends heavily on inferences to the best explanation. But “best” explanation depends in part on background beliefs. If one of our background beliefs is that we believe on good inductive evidence from scientific methods, that there are no natural norms, then appeal to normative facts to explain apparent normative truths like “eyes are for seeing” is blocked. So, on best scientific methods, we must deny the appearances: either normative realism is false, or normative natural facts are merely descriptive with the illusion of normativity. 
	⁃	By “scientific methods”  we mean one of two things: Firstly, when some people say “facts discovered by scientific methods” they do not mean a method at all but a doctrine, in this case, that normativity is not natural. But we can dismiss the dogma since I have given a case that, all things being equal, normative truths (described by Aristotelian Categoricals) are indeed apparently real and are indeed explained by inference to normative facts.  Or, secondly, some people mean by “scientific methods” those  that sometimes use the inference to the best explanation.  Scientists do use inference to the best explanation (abduction, hypotheses, explanation). It is a tool in the scientific tool belt. It is, in fact, ineliminable part of the scientific method. 
	⁃	And that is the kind of inference we used. The explanation of teleological phenomena (by teleological laws) may be wrong but it is not in the wrong ball park. It may be unscientific in the sense that any datum, theorem, proposition, law, or statement that turns out to be false is — ipso facto — unscientific. But it is not unscientific by being simply non-scientific, by being different from the scientific enterprise the way that street lights, rhetorical questions, and Cinderella movies are non-scientific. 
	4.	This is not strictly an objection: but someone might be thinking that the doctrine of natural norms is unpopular, and therefore probably false. If it were true, wouldn’t more scientists believe it? More philosophers of science? More philosophers? More people? My only response to this is that philosophical fashions come and go, and perhaps this particular fashion of denying teleology rests on a mistake; regardless, we can and should consider the argument on its own terms. I have argued that observing natural norms is an empirical business; who knows but that we may see natural normativity becomes the new, justified, scientific consensus? 
	5.	A fourth, very different objection. Suppose we grant that humans are supposed to think rationally is a norm, and a norm about human nature. We are, as a species, capable of advanced cognition and practice. (Those of us who think irrationally and act irrationally are, when we do so, defective.) So why not just explain the appearance of natural norms, of final causes, of purposes, of natural ends, by a combination natural selection and human projection? We are projecting our insides onto nature’s insides. When really, nature has no “inside,” no subjectivity, no consciousness. 
	⁃	Strangely enough, such an explanation divorces humanity from nature. It makes humans mysterious, radically discontinuous, opaque, anomalous, and queer. Since I am here assuming that humans are continuous with nature, I reject an account of teleology that makes it natural only to humans but unnatural to the cosmos as a whole. Furthermore, I have studiously avoided using too many uncontroversial examples of human normativity, preferring the more controversial (and hence more interesting) examples of non-human normative facts. 
	6.	A fifth, and also very different objection. Stephen Brown objects that arguments from an observation that A φ’s to the conclusion that A ought to φ prove too much, since it can be applied not only to non-humans but to non-living things. For example, we could “prove” that our hydrogen star is for radiating energy to the earth; the sun engenders life so therefore it is supposed to engender life. But this seems absurd: tthe sun does not have a purpose, a natural normativity. This is an objection about scope: if there are norms in terrestrial nature, do they extend to the whole cosmos? My presumptive case argues are really real and really natural but may be taken to prove only that norms exist for organic natural entities.
	⁃	On the one hand, I am perfectly content to rest my case. If I have persuaded you of a more modest conclusions, that normative laws obtain only in humans; or they obtain only in living organisms, or even more ambitiously, that they obtain only in organic systems (both organisms and their organs). 
	⁃	On the other hand, Thomas Nagel (2012) makes the case in Mind and Cosmos that teleological (and hence normative) laws are natural to the cosmos as a whole, including inorganic matter. I think there are two good reasons to be maximally ambitious about natural normativity. They are both reductios: suppose that there are natural normative facts about only organic entities, not non-living entities like the soil and the sun. Then we must affirm that when life appeared on earth, a new kind of case appeared as well: final causes. A new natural fact that was never there before, normative natural facts appear. For 13 billion years prior, there was only chance and efficient/material causes. Suddenly, and accidentally, the universe produced not only a new entity but a new kind of fact: normative facts. This sounds to me absurd, though if it does not sound so to you, I’m not sure how to persuade you otherwise. It makes more sense, I think, to suppose that natural normativity was there from the Big Bang forward. A second reductio: In the first objection, we considered that natural selection undermines the appearance of teleology. The problem is that natural selection does not apply to inorganic entities and systems like the soil, the sun, and the stars. There is no interstellar process analogous to genetic drift and the extinction of maladaptive traits. This also sounds to me absurd. The alternative, then, is more likely true: natural norms just are features of all of nature. Teleological normative laws are another brute kind of natural laws. 

Conclusion about Metaethics: Norms unite human nature and non-human nature
What is particularly exciting to me about natural normativity, if it is true, is its implication for ethics. I want to suggest, in closing, that the non-human stuff of the cosmos (quasars, deer, comets) and the human stuff of the cosmos (you and me) share a common structure, and that this underwrites many ethical claims. 
Descriptive natural laws describe formal relational structures at any given moment, a set of stable relations between natural entities; normative natural laws describe relational structures across time; a set of consistent end-directed relations between natural-things-as-they-are and natural things-as-they-ought-to-become. So the explanation for human end-directed behavior and non-human end-directed processes is the same: natural norms. 
Julia Annas puts it this way:  “What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already…” (Annas 1996). Natural normativity underwrites the belief that non-human nature and human nature share a common structure. This is just what ethical naturalism predicts. 
That structure is both formal and final, both descriptive and normative.  And discovering that structure is the joint task of philosophy (metaphysics) and science (the philosophy of nature), since experimental and theoretical methods are both fruitful. This is just what naturalism predicts. 
Ethical living is when we aim to become what we ought to become. Honesty, promise-keeping, rationality, prudence, moderation, perseverance, can be plausibly presented as traits that enable us to become what we are already are and what we ought to be.

            <Title>Chapter 2: MacIntyre</Title>
            <Text>In this chapter, we examine the ethical thought of Alasdair MacIntyre. MacIntyre’s oeuvre spans many decades and embodies many schools of thought. I shall treat his later work (from After Virtue to Dependent Rational Animals) as most definitive. Our first goal is to summarize and interact with just a few important theses of his key writings. Our second goal is to critique these points and draw from them lessons we can endorse, and upon which we can build in later chapters. 
MacIntyre thinks that virtues are good and useful for transforming communities and persons. At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) would do well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. Even though such a common vision of and pursuit of virtue is impossible to scale up indefinitely for 300 millions people in America, it is possible and beneficial at smaller, local scales. At the theoretical  level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 
So, in this chapter, I shall seek to elucidate the concept or concepts of virtue operative in MacIntyre’s theory. I shall also situate that theory against the backdrop of failed modern moral philosophies presented in the previous chapter.  Finally, I shall critically discuss some of MacIntyre’s key points and build on them toward two theses of my own.
By way of preview, the first thesis I shall offer is that success in moral inquiry is possible because moral inquiry answers (or can answer) to the moral facts. (This is my idiosyncratic statement of moral realism.) Moral inquiry, I shall argue, must be conceived (like psychology) as a process rather than (like mathematics) a static and ready-made argument about universal relations between propositional truths. The object studied by ethics is not merely ethical principles but ethical persons; but the subject studying ethics is also the ethical person. So, unlike mathematics or physics, the subject is also the object. One feature of persons is that we are living a finite life, beginning in complete ignorance (as children) and progressing toward death. So moral inquiry, when successful, is that part of our life when we become sensitive to reasons, and begin (usually under guidance) to reflect on our own nature as practical reasoners. We first reflect on our projects, commitments, and priorities, and secondly begin to adjust our projects to pursue worthy ends by better means or to pursue ends we find more worthy. 
The second thesis I shall defend is that moral inquiry depends indispensably on natural teleology, on what Philippa Foot calls “natural goodness.” ‘Natural teleology’ is a fancy phrase, but the point is simple: Some ends are real and natural; some end-directed motions, processes, and actions are real and natural. The notion of natural teleology has been disregarded, maligned, and misunderstood for many generations. So clarifying and defending my version of it will be an important piece of this chapter. As a brief pre-payment, I shall distinguish between various kinds of end-directed activity, from least controversial to most: (A) the end-directed (definitely intentional) actions and speech-acts of individual human subjects (e.g., going to the gym to get fit or uttering a sentence to communicate a proposition) and (B) the end-directed (definitely intentional) actions of groups, associations, societies; (C) the end-directed (intentional?) actions of all human beings in virtue of their humanity; (D) the end-directed (possibly intentional) processes of non-human animals (e.g., a deer fleeing a predatory to survive or a turtle swimming ashore to lay eggs); (E) the end-directed (though non-intentional) functions or processes of organic systems (the heart pumping blood to oxygenate the body, the optical photoreceptors converting light signals to electricity to produce sight); (F) the end-directed (though non-intentional) processes of individual non-organic substances (the piece of ice melting at 33 degrees Fahrenheit, the sunlight streaming through the atmosphere to make the plants grow); and (G) the end-directed (though non-intentional) global or cosmic process by which the universe seems to be moving (forming planets that can bring about life; abiogenerating life so as to bring about complex organisms). Having distinguished these, not all of them shall I defend.
Rather, the centrality of at least some human social or natural teleology (A)-(C) to normative virtue ethics cannot be understated. And the centrality of natural teleology — some subset of (C)-(G) — to giving a plausible foundation of virtue will be seen in not only MacIntyre, but Foot, Hursthouse, and Brown. Briefly, in After Virtue MacIntyre presented a “socially teleological” account of human virtue and practice rather than a “biologically teleological” account — one that “does not require the identification of any teleology in nature” (183%). I shall try to defend both. But for now, we must turn to a survey of MacIntyre’s ethical theory. 

Moral and Metaethical Disagreement
MacIntyre’s oeuvre may be seen as a response to the problem of moral disagreement. He was frustrated (as we have all been!) but the apparent impossibility of settling some moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreeing on the permissibility of abortion, the death penalty, the minimum wage, to name a few. The apparent impossibility of settling moral disagreements over weighty primary normative issues, like abortion, sexual ethics, torture, war, the proper uses of technology has become the defining datum of modern reflection on morality and ethics. 
MacIntyre observed the similarity to disagreement in moral/philosophical discussions and the disagreement in scientific discussions. He accordingly began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyarabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. While Feyerabend ended in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology, a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists (like myself), MacIntyre’s theory attempts (some would say unsuccessfully) to avoid relativism. But this is getting ahead of myself.  
The fact is that people disagree about morals. Many metaethicists react such widespread, rampant, shrill, and apparently intractable moral disagreement by giving up on moral realism. The old project was a searching for the objective moral facts, the self-evident moral truths, or fundamental moral principles by which moral disagreements can be peaceably and reasonably settled without browbeating, censorship, name-calling, and ejection from the conversation. The new project is to accept the painful truth that there are no such facts, no such truths, no such principles: agreement is either impossible or is going to come about by different means: social contract, say, or disparate communities accepting disparate sets of “common values”, each set incommensurable with the others but also invincible to criticism.
Other metaethicists react to widespread moral disagreement by redoubling their efforts to restore moral agreement by reference to moral facts, truths, or principles. Kantian (Korsgaard), utilitarian, contractarian, and now virtue ethical theorists compete in the marketplace of metaethics for the proper way to secure morality. 
It may not be obvious to those of us reading deeply in the discipline, but a moment’s reflection on modern metaethics reveals an iteration of the problem of moral disagreement. The disagreement among metaethicists (since Moore) about the proper explanation of and solution to disagreement among ethicists (since Hobbes, Hume, and Kant) has become the new problem of disagreement. 

The After Virtue Project
MacIntyre engaged in this metaethical dispute for some years. After a while, he gave up. Instead, he initiated a new project, which some call the “After Virtue Project” (Murphy 2003):  to explain the failure of metaethics to solve the failure of primary ethics. not only moral disagreement but the failure of metaethical explanations of moral disagreement. The key works in this project are After Virtue (1984), Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (1988), and Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry (1990), and Dependent Rational Animals (1999). Each lays out more pieces of an unfolding ethical theory, (arguably) culminating in Dependent Rational Animals. But the MacIntyrean spirit of inquiry demands that we not treat his last statement of his theory as the final (ultimate) statement of the theory. 
After Virtue most clearly states the problem of moral disagreement in modern moral philosophy, putting it in historical context. It argues that the problem at the root of the problem of moral disagreement is a series of fragmentations, facts from values, the self from the community, my good from the common good, and our concepts of justice and rationality from tradition. Each of these elements contribute to making modern, secular, rationalistic moral enquiry a hopeless endeavor. The upshot is that we have a dilemma: If modern rationalistic morality is hopeless (moral inquiry as encyclopedia), then we must either embrace Nietzsche’s self-justifying amoral Will-to-Power (moral inquiry as genealogy), or embrace the Aristotelian tradition of virtue (morality as tradition). 
If the deconstructive argument is correct, then modern moralities like deontology and utilitarianism (including all their trappings and purport of objectivity) are just as expressivistic as emotivism. A recurring theme in After Virtue and beyond is that there are two possible prognoses of this illness. The first is to abandon the purport of objectivity: follow expressivism and, ultimately, side with Nietzsche. We unmask all rational justifications of morality. We opt for cunning rather than wisdom; amplify our means to deteriorated ends. But we should not embrace Nietzsche. 
The second prognosis is to abandon the totalized fiction of community-free autonomous individual self that animates modern liberalism. “We lack,” he says, “any coherent rationally defensible statement of the liberal individualist point of view” (241%). If we see ourselves, again, as members of a community within a shared tradition, with shared origins, goals, and standards, then the objectivity and rational basis of morality becomes intelligible again. That is the Aristotelian tradition. We should get back to tradition to go forward. 

After Virtue
Let’s look at the problem in a bit more detail. The first and most obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.MacIntyre, After Virtue 6. Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in a despair of ever reaching agreement.The dual aspect of modern moral philosophy is that disputants on either side purport to be presenting the objective moral truth and they possess no unavailable rational standard for supporting their own view, let alone convincing others on purely rational or evidential grounds.  Individually, these aspects are not puzzling: One pattern is that when I meet people who do not share my tastes or preferences, I do not browbeat; I simply I live and let live. Another pattern is that when I meet people whom I view as ignorant or mistaken,  I try to persuade them by appealing to evidence to ascribe to the same rational, putatively objective standards I endorse But moral discourse doesn’t fit either of these non-puzzling patterns. how can my own, arbitrary, unaccountable opinions and preferences form the basis for browbeating those who do not share the same opinions and preferences as if they were not just different from me but ignorant and mistaken? Moral discourse with its expression of moral disagreement still retain the appearance of rationality at the same time that the seem to have given up on the rationality and publically-accessible nature of morality. 

Virtue, Telos, and Human Nature
Now let’s look at the putative solution in a bit more detail. MacIntyre revisits the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”: the Nicomachean Ethics. There we find the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics” (148%). For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos” (148%). 
We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Hence our practical rationality is natural even though it is not material. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The telos of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.
MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to 4th century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 
So what is a virtue, for MacIntyre? His account of virtue includes three layers or dimensions: individual, social, and human. The first layer of the account is virtue as skill. Virtues are those “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices” (191%). The absence of virtue, by contrast, “effectively presents” achieving the goods internal to practice. This definition of virtue (in terms of practices) demands an explication of the concept of practice. A practice, for MacIntyre, is a term of art denoting an activity carried out in a community (of fellow practictioners) according to a common history, common standards, and common goals.  Examples include chess, medicine, farming, politics. Lutz summarizes MacIntyre’s famous passage in this way:  a virtue is “(1) a complex social activity that (2) enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. (3) Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, (4) the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.” (Lutz, After Virtue 187). 
	To get this definition in a bit clearer view, take MacIntyre’s favored example of a practice: political activity. Political activity can be done for reasons internal or external to the practice. That is, political activity can be done in order to bring about those objects necessarily political: the health, securing, and flourishing of the polis. Or it can be done in order to achieve “external” (unessential) goods like fame, power, prestige, or book deals. Effectiveness in attaining these external goods does not constitute virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice are temptations. Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 
Now, practices are distinct from (but related to) institutions or traditions. For example, a university is an institution defined by a set of practices in which professors and students engage. Thomas is a tradition defined by a set of arguments playing out over time embedded in a social community. 
This distinction helps us to build up the second dimension of virtue.  Virtues indexed to practices are only one part of MacIntyre’s account; the second layer or dimension is social. This dimension stands to reason: agents are individuals but not merely individuals. 

The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context. (MacIntyre, After Virtue 223%)

The notion of a detachable self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self. Rather, each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture. Furthermore, it is very often in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. Injustice, cowardice, “corrupt traditions” (223%). The persuasive examples are those of a present day black American whose identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites, or a present day Irishman whose identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century English to 18th century Irish. The if the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 
	But thus far, by the first and second dimensions of his account of virtue, the account virtually begs to be read as a type of relativism: Is torture a practice? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. But MacIntyre denies being a relativist (After Virtue,  xii-xiii%). The full answer to the charge of relativism I detail below. For now, we only need to see how this objection forces MacIntyre to add the third layer or dimension to his account of virtue. He admits that there might be evil practices. We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil. If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. So the account must do justice to the assumption that virtues are good for their possessor. 
	The third level, then, is the broadest — that of humanity. Individuals and societies or social groups do not share much (anything?) but what we are as biological and psychological creatures. MacIntyre admits that defining virtues in terms of practices necessitates questioning whether life as a whole can be virtuous — the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life” (203%). Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition. So, from this broadest view, even practices and institutions can be judged by how well they accord with our overall purpose, our overall life, and our overall nature.
	As for human nature, human beings are practical reasoners; we are dependent, rational animals. That is what we are. And yes, we have natures. That word and that concept are not out-dated, outmoded, irrelevant, obsolete, unscientific, or any other such slur. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals (MacIntyre 1999, p.x). And we are practical reasoners (more on that below). We are in a position to see how MacIntyre’s account of virtue works. We find ourselves in a tradition (or more than one). Within that, we find ourselves engaging in practices. We engage in some of these practices inside, and others outside, institutions. Virtues are those skills that enable us to perform the practice excellently; virtues are also those skills and habits by which we perform various social roles excellently; but finally virtues are those qualities by which we aim our practices toward an excellent human life, and by which we integrate our various social roles toward human ends. For instance, the most general virtuous qualities contribute to the flourishing of human being qua practical reasoner. The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. The “human nature” that is universally distributed across each member of our species is the capacity (sometimes unrealized) to become practical reasoners. This  makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. 
	So much for a summary of MacIntyre’s account of virtue. Some further comments are needed to fill out the relationship of virtue to eudaemonia. Talk of human nature and telos are inseparable. For MacIntyre, the loss of telos (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But telos unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear telos is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 
	MacIntyre’s provisional conception of our human telos is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is” (210). Our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human telos is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our telos consists in.  
	This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative (see especially After Virtue, Chp. 15%). Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 
	The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable” (215%) The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single telos governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative. 
	With this in mind, the relation between virtue and telos comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions (223%). The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our telos. MacIntyre says: “The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good” (219%). The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of telos as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues 
	These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good” (219). 

Dependent Rational Animals
	This summary has, so far, kept itself mostly to After Virtue, only alluding to other works in the “After Virtue Project.” I would like now to continue the story by summarizing Dependent Rational Animals before turning to a few objections and making my own positive contributions to our developing account. 
	The project of Dependent Rational Animals is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally important as our independence, our autonomy and self-sufficiency. There are virtues of both dependence and autonomy. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  
	Let’s examine a few quotations on each of these themes. Regarding (a), MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate or overshadow the commonalities between us and other animals. “I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity” (MacIntyre 1999, 8%).  Regarding (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says he “virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities they're specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how do while they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.” (Op. Cit.). Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “me there in the modern state north of modern family can supply that kind of political and social Association is needed” (9%). 

Objections
	Objections to MacIntyre’s theorizing come in many forms. A first objection is that his historicism relativizes ethical theory. A second is that his tradition-constituted definition of rationality is self-contradictory. 
	Defenders of the “tradition-less tradition” of modern liberalism in various forms object to his outright rejection of liberalism. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality. Also, postmodern philosophers agree with his critique of liberalism but choose, in a word, Nietzsche over Aristotle. 

Take-Aways (Introduction)
	While I agree with much of MacIntyre’s picture of the development of western civilization, the thesis I would like to extract, develop, and defend is this: human practices are necessarily end-directed (teleological). “Social teleology” has at least two and possibly three aspects: individual, collective, and human. The first aspect is the end-directed behavior of each agent; the second is the end-directed behavior of social groups, like families, nations, clubs, congregations, and so on. The third, and most objectionable, aspect, is the end-directed activity of our species as a whole. What, if anything, does every human being intentionally pursue? 
	Let’s provide some names to summarize these notions: 
	Human Practical Teleology  Thesis: Persons, when we act rationally, act for a reason or reasons and toward some end. 
	Group Practical Teleology Thesis: Groups, when we act rationally, act for reasons and toward some end(s). 
	Human Natural Teleology Thesis. Insofar as an agent is a human, that agent acts for a reason, both as an individual and in social groups. 
	In the next chapter, I shall defend one version of the more controversial and less popular Natural Teleology Thesis: At least some parts of nature (that is, non-human nature) are necessarily end-directed. But more on that later. 
	To defend social teleology we have to point out what phenomena up for explanation, and clarify why social teleological explanations are the best. That I shall attempt in the first section. In the second section, I tackle an important piece of this defense: a defense of the very notion of a human nature. Finally, if there is such a thing as human nature, then it is reasonable to query whether human nature is part of “nature” as a whole — what is our relationship to the rest of nature? A very old and very widespread belief is that humans are sui generis and somehow “special.” Is this belief mistaken, a superstition, an instance of magic-thinking, a holdover from pre-Darwinian  or pre-scientific thinking? I tackle these questions in the third section. 

Take Away I - Social Teleology
To defend social teleology we have to point out what phenomena up for explanation, and clarify why social teleological explanations are the best. That I shall attempt in the first section. 

Consider as explananda the following phenomena: 
	A.	A man goes to the gym to get fit for his film role; a woman delivers a speech to capture key approval ratings in Iowa;
	B.	The NRA pushes a concealed-carry bill to allow licensed guns to cross state lines; the U.N. pushes for a universal climate agreement to organize climate action across international borders; 
	C.	All human beings pursue survival; all humans want power;
	D.	A deer flees a predatory to survive; a turtle walks ashore to lay her eggs. 
	E.	The heart pumps blood to oxygenate the body; the optical photoreceptors converting light signals to electricity to produce sight;
	F.	A piece of ice melts at 33 degrees Fahrenheit; the sunlight streams through the atmosphere to make the plants grow; 
	G.	After the Big Bang, giant molecular clouds collapse into solar systems which eventually form planets upon which organic life can possibly come about. 
Each of these phenomena are actions or motions that take place over time and toward an end. The first three statements (A)-(C) refer to human actions; the last four (D)-(G) refer to putative end-directed motions or actions of non-human organisms (D), of organic systems (E), of inorganic matter and energy on earth (F), and of cosmic matter and energy  (G). Motions (D)-(G) are sometimes called teleonomical phenomena. This name is fine so far as it goes. Teleonomy is supposed to distinguish the categorical of intentional end-directed activity to apparently or mechanically end-directed activity. I prefer to distinguish between intentional teleological phenomena from non-intentional teleological phenomena, since these categories do not prejudge against the conclusion that, say, the survival-enhancing instincts of deer are teleological. 

Take Aways II - Human Nature
In the second section, I tackle an important piece of this defense: a defense of the very notion of a human nature. 
	Sarte famously taught that human beings have no inherent nature. There are no “built-in” limits to what we can do and become. We create ourselves ex nihilo. 
	As I understand the term, a nature refers to just about the same entity as another important (and highly contentious) modern term: species. A nature is a formal property or cluster of formal properties that define a given thing. To say that “chairs have legs by nature” is to say that chairs by virtue of being what they are have four legs (which may be false). To say that bucks have horns is to identify a formal property all bucks share. 
	Theories of human nature give various weights to biological, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual properties of human beings. All humans are rational animals; all humans are images of God; all humans are rational, social animals; humans are highly evolved animals of the species homo sapiens sapiens; all 
	A nature defines what a thing is across time. An acorn is not an oak tree — not a mature oak tree yet — but an acorn has the same nature as the mature oak tree. 
	Natures are discovered more or less empirically. We examine tendencies of a given organism and infer to such-and-such a nature. The posited nature is a formal cause that explains those tendencies. 
	On my view, human nature is a discernible form defined by a set of biological and psychological properties. 


Take Aways III - Nature and Human Nature
Finally, if there is such a thing as human nature, then it is reasonable to query whether human nature is part of “nature” as a whole — what is our relationship to the rest of nature? A very old and very widespread belief is that humans are sui generis and somehow “special.” Is this belief mistaken, a superstition, an instance of magic-thinking, a holdover from pre-Darwinian  or pre-scientific thinking? I tackle these questions in the third section.

            <Title>TUESDAY 1. Shafer-Landeau, Moral Realism, a Defense</Title>
            <Text>Author abstract: 
Moral Realism is a systematic defence of the idea that there are objective moral standards. In the tradition of Plato and G. E. Moore, Russ Shafer-Landau argues that there are moral principles that are true independently of what anyone, anywhere, happens to think of them. These principles are a fundamental aspect of reality, just as much as those that govern mathematics or the natural world. They may be true regardless of our ability to grasp them, and their truth is not a matter of their being ratified from any ideal standpoint, nor of being the object of actual or hypothetical consensus, nor of being an expression of our rational nature. Shafer-Landau accepts Plato's and Moore's contention that moral truths are sui generis. He rejects the currently popular efforts to conceive of ethics as a kind of science, and insists that moral truths and properties occupy a distinctive area in our ontology. Unlike scientific truths, the fundamental moral principles are knowable a priori. And unlike mathematical truths, they are essentially normative: intrinsically action-guiding, and supplying a justification for all who follow their counsel. Moral Realism is the first comprehensive treatise defending non-naturalistic moral realism in over a generation. It ranges over all of the central issues in contemporary metaethics, and will be an important source of discussion for philosophers and their students interested in issues concerning the foundations of ethics.

My Summary



Reflections

Shafer-Landau does a lot of heavy lifting on behalf of moral realists. He offers substantive cases against non-cognitivism, against moral skepticism, against a Humean psychology, against motivational judgment internalism, and in favor of cognitivism, moral knowledge of self-evident moral principles, motivational judgment externalism. 

His approach has been described as “shotgun” and each chapter aims high but leaves many details to the reader and commentators to dispute and work out. </Text>
            <Comments>This is a book Anita, I’m sure, will want me to know very well. I love his essay, ethics as philosophy. I’m sure this will be good. I’d like to have a nice, 10 or so page summary.

## Introduction ##

Alasdair MacIntyre is a highly influential moral and political philosopher. Martha Nussbaum said

His many books and articles have addressed ethics from a historical perspective, arguing that socially-embedded traditions both constitute and are constituted by their ethical concepts. MacIntyre may be classified as an analytic philosopher and virtue ethicist, but he denies both labels. He has refused to restrict himself neatly to one style, school of thought, or subject. Instead, he has written as a philosopher about analytic philosophy, virtue ethics, the history of philosophy, continental philosophy, Marxism, Christianity, university education, political science, philosophy of science, and epistemology. His work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations. For example, he argues that emotivism is not only a metaethical theory of moral language but a “culture” with its own paradigmatic institutional expressions, like bureaucracy and therapy. 

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy; he re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.] Where Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38]

2. Going Back to the Drawing Board about Morality, Rationality, and Normativity


Morality
Ethics or moral philosophy has been much maligned. Even since Hume called ethics “easy and obvious”, critics have either characterized ethics as much too easy to be or much too hard to be worth bothering over. Metaethics, in analytic philosophy, for the last 100 years has breathed some life into what Darwall calls “philosophical ethics” — including normative ethical and meta-ethical considerations as aspects of one philosophical theory. Bioethics, in applied philosophy, for the last 40 years or so, has breathed some life into ethics as well. But confusion about the foundations of ethics persists. Confusion about the significance of moral disagreement is one example: does just the fact that Bob thinks A and Bettie thinks not-A render all of ethical science bankrupt? But there are others. Alasdair MacIntyre famously compared moral philosophy today to a hypothetical post-apocolyptic natural philosophy, where all the scientists have died and all the science textbooks preserved only in fragments. People have snatches here and there of knowledge, but have lost the overall point. Nancy Murphy’s essay helped me here, in How Successful is Naturalism?   

Rationality
Rationality is the purview of judgments. Propositional judgments like  
1a. “It rained today”, 
2a. “Kathy is smart”, 
3a. “Basing your beliefs on available evidence is epistemically responsible” are all judgments made by the faculty of reason. Such judgments may be thought or uttered. Regardless, they are (or perhaps express) propositions. 
As such, they are in principle subject to logical relations between other propositions. For example, other propositions like 
1b. “if it rained today, the grass will need mowing,” and 
2b. “Every paper of Kathy’s I’ve read has been quite insightful” and 
3b. “Bob ignores available evidence” 
bear important relations between 1-3. When those relations are made explicit, we can begin to judge the value of inferences from 1a to 1b and so on. (For instance, I can infer from 1 and 1b that (1c) “the grass will need mowing.”) 

Rationality as it is traditionally understood has two moods: theoretical and practical. Theoretical rational judgments aspire to describe reality as it is. So, most basically, “The cat is (currently) on the mat” aspires to denote the location of the cat at the time and in the context of utterance. It is true just in case that the cat’s being on the mat obtains. But description of reality come in a wide variety of types. Since there are many types or modes of reality, there are many types or modes of our judgments about realities. Some still mundane examples: “The cat was on the mat” aspires to describe the way things were at some point in the past; “the cat will be on the mat when he gets back” aspires to describe reality as it will be in the future. 
As it is sometimes expressed, the “direction of fit” of theoretical rational judgments is world to mind. We want, when we are making judgments (using our rational faculties) to get the world right. (I am here bypassing whole conversations about the correspondence theory of truth by assuming the correspondence theory is, well, true). 
Now, theoretical rational judgments can also pick out non-temporally indexed entities and properties like mathematical objects (on a platonistic view of numbers),  or modal properties, or logical relations. 
For example, judging it to be true that “Spelunking in Mammoth Cave is impossible” is affirming the truth of the proposition; the proposition aspires to denote real modal properties, depending of course on one’s metaphysical commitments about modality. (I am hear trying to avoid such hare’s nests and assuming that our common way of speaking is not massively mistaken.)
For another example, take the judgment that “squares have four sides.” I don’t take the judgment that squares have four sides to be merely conceptual — a judgment about the word square or the concept of squares. I take it to be also a kind of synthesis or discovery. We have to look at and think about a square or two before we realize — perhaps in a flash — that all squares are necessarily four-sided things. Or, if you prefer “the concept of a square is the concept of a necessarily four-sided thing.” 
Theoretical rational judgments also undertake other tasks — to explain, and to hypothesize or predict.R. Jay Wallace, “Practical Reason”, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. We might ask: why is there cat hair on the mat? Perhaps (surprise) “because the cat was on the mat.” This explanation aspires to describe not only a state of affairs about the location of the cat in the past, but also posits a causal relation between that state of affairs and the (present) facts. Or we might ask: Will the cat ever come sit on the mat? “Yes, he has slept there every night for the past two weeks; the cat will sit on the mat.” This hypothesis doesn’t just aspire to describe the future state of affairs but aspires to describe an inferential relation between the cat’s past behavior and future behavior. 
A few other varieties of theoretical rational judgments. According to cognitivist moral philosophers, judgments with evaluative predicates similarly aspire to describe the moral facts: “Bob lacks integrity.”  We might say the same of judgments with predicates of aesthetic value: “The horse farms are beautiful this time of year.” 
All of these propositions aspire to describe reality as it is. They aspire to pick out facts of various kinds: present empirical facts (the cat is on the mat), past or future empirical facts, modal facts, and moral or aesthetic facts. 

Practical Reason
Practical rational judgments aspire not to describe reality but to describe what ought to be. So, most basically, “We need to run to the store for more milk” expresses a proposition but not one that aspires to describe the facts as they are — “We are out of milk” would do that better. Rather, the proposition picks out what Allan Gibbered calls “the thing to do.” As Gibbered says, I have appropriated a couple of turns of phrase in English to express planning judgments: if A is “the thing to do,” as I’m using the expression, that rules out doing anything else; if A is “okay to do,” that rules out ruling A out.Gibbard, Thinking How to Live 137. Practical rationality is defined in distinction to theoretical reflection which “is concerned with matters of fact and their explanation [in that it] takes a distinctively normative question as its starting point.”R. Jay Wallace. 

Reason (and practical reason) are human faculties we have (or, if you prefer, “processes”)
We humans have the ability to give reasons for what ought to be done or left undone, what ought to be said or left unsaid, what ought to be made or unmade. All functional human adults have this ability — barring developmental disability or mental illness. We make plans and try to act them out. We write scripts for what we want to say (either on stage or to a loved one); we write out stage direction for what we want to do and when; we write out laws defining what how we want everyone in our society, on pain of civil consequences, to behave and talk. We make resolutions for virtues to acquire in the coming year, or weight to be lost, or vices to be kicked. 
However this ability came about, we seem to have it. I am using the term ‘faculty’ to denote the ability to, more or less at will, initiate this process of rational cognition or rational deliberation. I am not trying to assume too much about human psychology or philosophical anthropology by using the noun  “Rationality”  with its connotations of a capital “R”. If you prefer, call it “rationalities” with a lower-case “r” and consider it a cluster of cognitive processes. Whether you think those processes are implanted in human beings by God or Nature as a spark of the divine Logos, or think those processes are naturally selected via genetic drift over countless generations of failed early models, you probably agree that those processes exist (or that faculty exists) in us, and that they are operative right now as you listen and as I speak. 

Can Practical Reason even exist?
Now the question is whether rationality can be practical — whether practicality can be rational. If we assume, as Hume appears to have, that facts and values are different and that reason aspires to judge facts while values are a world apart, then there is just no such thing as practical reason. If values are things desired, aspired to, hoped for, wished for, instinctually pursued, and so on, and nothing more — then there is no such thing as practical reason. 

But if reason has these two moods, then some of the rational judgments we make are practical as well — for instance, I might judge that “I ought to save for retirement” and then proceed to fill out a form authorizing my university to reserve a portion of my paycheck for retirement. I would be acting on the judgment. I would be treating the judgment as a maxim or rule of conduct. I would be judging it to be true in some sense that I really ought to save for retirement — that is really the thing to do. On this view, “the proper focus of practical reflection is the question of what it would be to act well (Lawrence 1995, Foot 2001)”.R. Jay Wallace, “Practical Reason” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Viewing practical reflection as necessarily value-laden, as the kind of thing that by definition seeks the good, is of course not Humean. But so much the worse for Hume. 



The Normative Web gets it right

“Other philosophers remain unimpressed with this naturalistic approach to practical reason. One ground for dissatisfaction with it is the following. The expressivist strategy relies on an initial contrast between practical reflection on the one hand, and the genuine forms of cognitive activity characteristic of theoretical reasoning on the other. There has to be some important sense in which practical discourse does not satisfy the standards of rationality that distinguish authentic cognitive discourse in the literal sense; otherwise the contention that normative discourse is expressive rather than cognitive will lack any significant content. But the contrast between theoretical and practical reflection required for this purpose seems elusive. As we saw in section 1 above, theoretical reasoning appears to be no less a normative enterprise than practical reasoning.  It is plausibly understood to concern itself with reasons for belief, the evidence and other considerations that speak for and against particular conclusions about the way things are in the world. To the extent this is the case, theoretical and practical reasoning would both seem equally problematic from the naturalistic perspective—assuming, that is, that it leaves no place for such normative considerations as reasons. But if naturalism calls into question the credentials of theoretical reason, it thereby undermines the contrast between genuine reasoning and noncognitive forms of normative and evaluative discourse on which expressivists themselves rely.”R. Jay Wallace

John McDowell gets it right
For John McDowell, the “space of reasons” includes both theoretical and practical reasons. That is, human beings are “sensitive to reasons” which entails both that we can speculate about we ought to believe (about what is true, which is the same) and about what we ought to do or say (about what is good, which is the same).

“However, she then turns to ask just how suitable the kind of natural facts characteristic of Foot’s account look, from within a developed space of reasons, for grounding the rational justification of morality. On her reading, the outlook is not good. But in her attempt to reconcile the apparently incommensurable views of these two neo-Aristotelians, Hursthouse pursues a laudable goal, since success here would contribute significantly to the appeal of their shared perspective. It would be significant to at least provide an outline for the reconciliation of two central Aristotelian themes, the role of human function and the role of a proper moral upbringing, in the rational justification of morality.”
Thompson’s essay adjudicates this issue: can natural facts be reasons for acting? The first answer is that yes, they can be reasons for acting without mediation through culture. The second answer is no: they can only be reasons for acting after proper mediation through culture, after being “imported” from bald nature into the space of reasons. 
Ferreira summarizes the two positions as “empirical naturalism” and “excellence naturalism.” Ferreira, “Reasons from Aristotelian Naturalism”. 
(Ferreira 2007)
What is wrong with empirical naturalism?
It cannot account for the enculturation of human values. Take for example the human practice of making and wearing clothing on top of our skin. Is this natural? On the one hand, it is clearly artificial. Beavers do not make, select, and wear their fur — it simply grows. Birds do not shop for new fashionable feathers. On the other hand, it is clearly natural. Ignoring speculative pre-historical history for the moment, the earliest archeological and written evidence tells about humans wearing clothing. We wear clothing “automatically.” But we make it from natural materials and wear or trade it “automatically.” So it is both natural and artificial. This is an acceptable introduction to the concept of second natural. For humans, clothes-wearing is second nature. 
What is wrong with excellence naturalism?
The remaining problem with excellence naturalism is… 
Developing Foot’s ideas about natural normativity, Annas says this:
“What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out, but was rendered invisible for many decades by the ascendancy of non-naturalistic theories of ethical discourse. (Once we appreciate it, we can understand why those theories have been so barren of insight.)” (Annas 1996)</Text>

            <Title>Stephen Brown chapter draft 1</Title>
            <Text>### Stephen Brown Chapter

Brown's project is to advance the cause of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism.  His opening lines are these: 

&gt;Human beings are a species of social animal for which there is a characteristic way of life. An individual human being may be evaluated as good or bad according to how wall that individual realizes the human way of life. I argue that there is teleology in nature; that the fact/value gap -- however we reasonably construe that idea -- is not an overriding concern; and that neo-Darwinism is no threat to the theory. (Brown 2008, 1)

Brown's aim is to defend a species of ethical naturalism that is cognitivist and in which "important ethical norms and evaluations are grounded in natural facts." (2008, 2). He does not reject outright but rather brackets the supernatural. And he defines 'nature' as "what[ever] our latest and best science tells us it is" including psychology and sociology along with physics and biology. 

What is the explandandum for ethical naturalism? There are several. Each may need to look to its own science for an answer. 

* How an individual comes to have the norms he or she does: psychology, personal history. 
* How a group comes to have the norms they do: sociology, anthropology, etc. 
He admits, and seems melencholically resigned to the fact, that what we "end up with [might be] a mere description and not, alas, a justification..." (Brown 3)

The metaphysical framework in which Brown wants to build ethical naturalism is this: nature is teleological. (Compare Nagel's natural teleology and ) He doesn't want to reduce ethics to biology or physics, but to explain ethics in "terms of the *rest* of nature" (Brown 5, quoting Bernard Williams). But what is the "rest of nature?" Especially if human beings are radically continuous with nature, as he avers, why do we even keep such locutions as "the rest"? He means that "the rest" of nature includes non-human stuff (rocks, stars, trees) and non-ethical human stuff (psychology, biology, culture, etc.). But wait. Does ethical naturalism have to ground normative facts in non-normative facts? No. He, along with Nagel, finds this dogmatic starting point unjustified. Rather, some normative facts are brute (for their domain at least) and ground other normative facts. These natural normative facts are natural teleological facts. "Teleology allows us to infer normative conclusions" (Brown 5). 

He also wants to account for our criterion [x] that ethics seems objective. He also wants to account for the sense that ethics can be or should be a science or something like a science or continuous with another recognizable science or (at the very least) not inconsistent with other recognizable sciences. 

#### Social Utility 
As a social group, we have a common good. For Aristotle -- and Brown seems to agree -- your good, my good, and our social good are intimiately interrelated. 

Social and political pluralism has pros and cons. Brown hopes a naturalistic ethical theory may be of some use in negotiating the "methods of dealing with conflicts among divergent belief systems" (2008, 10). Rather than rooting putative ethical truths in contentious religious claims, we may hope to root ethical truths in a universally accessible nature. We may hope to have "freedom *of* religion as well as freedom *from* religion", enjoying whatever truths might originate from a religious tradition without relying on that religion (10). We may hope that the one thing that unites us, our common human nature, may be a source of commanility in guidance on how to live. 


#### Telos and Function - General considerations
The way we discover our common nature is by examine our *ergon* (our proper work). Brown says that this ergon is almost *function*, but not quite. He summarizes Aristotle's famous argument that *eudaimonia* is our good but seems to favor the second argument. 

&gt;If we know a thing's function, then we can easily figure out what it is for the thing to function well. A thing's functinong well is its best good. Thus, if we know what the function of a human being *qua* human being is, then we can figure out what it is for a human being to function well, and this well functioning of a human being is the best good for that sort of being. (Brown 23)

The function of a thing, in Aristotle, is the work it performs that is not also the function of other things. Each thing like 'hammer' has a differentia from all non-hammers -- namely, pounding or hammering. And each type of hammer has a differentia from other hammers: framing, finishing hammer, mallot, sledge, etc., all pound but pound different objects or do so differently. But human beings live and grow and metabolize like plants; we sense perceive like horses, oxen, and other animals; our ergon 'expresses' or 'requires'  *reason* (or as Foot would have it, speech). Our function is to reason; our good is reasoning well. 

How reasoning well relates wth virtue is a bit trickier. Are virtues simply (by definition) the reasonable activities? If so, then the connection between reason and virtue remains tight. But if not, they need to be connected. 

I was illuminated by Brown's discussion of three related concepts:

* the human good
* the good human being
* good for a human being

Here is one way of putting it: If virtue is the human good, then a good human is virtuous, and virtues are (as we say of spinach and broccoli) "good for us." By "virtue is the human good" we seem to mean our good qua species. By "good for us" we mean something more specific to individual members of the species. Something related to the human good is good for us in that it feels good, actualizes our potential, fulfills us, perfects us, or something like that. 


#### The function of artifacts and natural kinds

What is the function of a horse? Brown's discussion effectively explores all the options here. Unlike a knife or other artificial object, the function of a horse would not be defined by human artifice. Nor is a horse's function or ergon obviously some work relating to human use (riding, pulling, etc.). It is implausible to suppose that a species is indexed to another species, that a the species is incomplete without being used by humans; furthermore, the individual jobs horses do might be more effectively done by other species (oxen, etc.). But horses have been in some part bred by humans for human purposes (riding, showing, fighting, hunting). So it might be that the *current* breeds of domesticated horses *are in fact* more like knives than wild dogs. Even so, what about other non-domesticated horses? Either they have no ergon at all, or their ergon is something unrelated to human artifice. 

Take the first option: horses have no ergon, no function, no discernable final cause, no unique activity they do that nothing else in nature does. Does this option mean we are giving up on "natural teleology" for biology? Plato and Aristotle both speak as if all of nature was teleological. So it would mean giving up on the platonic or Aristotelian version of teleology, for whatever that is worth. But Plato's teleology in the *Timaeus* is admittedly mythical and speculative, while Aristotle explores non-teleological explanations of natural phenomena in his *Physics*, the he says that "Nature does nothing absurdly or to no purpose" (*De Caelo* 291b14). So we haven't quite given up on Aristotle yet. Rather, we need to hear how, if at all, he articulates the natural teleology of individual biological species. 

#### An argument by analogy?

Brown highlights that Aristotle's argument by analogy amounts to a rhetorical question with which he is trying to "badger" us.  Aristotle's human craftsmen have jobs or functions -- the carpenter works with wood, the horse trainer trains horses, and so on -- so are we to say that humans have no function?

* Humans A, B, C, etc. (qua roles we play, mothers, fathers, craftsmen, etc) all have functions. (via observation)
* Therefore humanity (qua species) have functions. (via inductive generalization)

* Humans (qua members of the species) are like craftsmen.
* All craftsmen have functions. (via observation)
* Therefore humans (qua species) have functions. (via analogy to first premise)

But in what way are humans "like" craftsmen? Aristotle's argument crucially depends on whether one accepts the fundamental comparison between humans qua biological creatures and the roles humans play. 


#### Contemporary methods

Brown's suggestion is to apply more familiar methods for finding function. Suppose we find a mysterious artefact in an archeological dig. How would we discover its function? We would compare it to similar known objects of the same time and place, if possible. If there are no similar objects, then we might use the object for various purposes to ascertain what it does (not just what it does *uniquely well*). Of course, multiple objects do the same thing: Brown mentions that phones and email both communicate across long distances. 

A response: His example doesn't tell. The "primitive human stumbling across various items" does not have time to familiarize herself with the telephone and email. He does not mention that, given time and/or instruction, the primitive human would discover what we industrialized moderns already know: that email is most often best for asynchronic communication, and phone most often best for synchronic communication. 

Regardless, Brown suggests that the biologist looking at organs "faces similar problems"  (Brown 2008, 30). She can compare the functions of similar organisms; if no similar organs are forthcoming, she can see what it *does*. And she can "look at the organ from an evolutionary standpoint" -- that is, "see what effects the existence of the organ has on the survival and reproduction of the organism" (Brown 2008, 30). This last does not invalidate the Platonic/Aristotelian method of looking for what the organism does best, but supplements it. 

#### The human function
So what about human beings qua species? Forget my individual telos for a moment. When we examine the function of any old item of human life, say, a knife, we see that it cuts. 
&gt;What is the purpose of cutting vegetables? To prepare them for cooking. Why prepare vegetables for cooking? So we can eat them. What is the purpose of eating? so we can go on living. The series could stop there, but one could continue on and ask what the purpose in living is. In that we confront an existential question. (Brown 31-32)
Before strongly arguing for or against any of the options, Brown mentions and considers several. 
He briefly considers just ending the series by repeating the last answer: we eat in order to keep living, and we live in order to keep living -- the end. He also considers that the question loses its species-indexed meaning at this point and becomes member-indexed -- what is *my* purpose.  He also considers whether that question has any meaning — perhaps it is an idle and ill-framed question — but ultimately endeavors to answer it. Finally, he considers what would be the significance of answering in the negative. If I qua member of my species have no intrinsic purpose does that mean that any of my self-selected purposes — from social work to suicide — are equally good? 

Brown ultimately concludes that we have no purpose qua human being. We have roles which are inseparable from purposes, even if there is no “humanity” at the base of these roles by which to judge a deeper or ultimate purpose. 

A response: I don’t think feeble speculations to the contrary will very satisfyingly hinder a suicidal person, in the grips of existential despair, from contemplating the wildest and most irrational deeds of harming self and other. That is not to say that my philosophy would. For the bar is set high for philosophies that would explain (a) why most people prefer to live and indeed love life, and (b) why, in spite of *arguments* to the contrary, (a) is still true. 

Carrying on with the notion that our roles define us, Brown considers a theological version of the story. The function of life is “to love God, to do His will, to serve Him.” (Brown 2008, 33).

            <Text>Introduction

Is normativity natural? Are normative facts part of nature?  In this paper, I make a brief case for an affirmative answer. 
In the first section, I present a presumptive argument for natural normativity. Normative truths can be expressed in Aristotelian Categorical statements of the form all A’s φ. The existence of natural normative facts is best explanation of two other natural facts, both wrapped up in apparent teleology or end-directed phenomena. 
In the second section, I present a battery of seemingly devastating objections to the existence of objective natural norms. Not only does one risk mockery when flying in the face of current philosophical orthodoxy, but some substantive scientific and philosophical objections seem devastating. I argue that these arguments against natural normativity persuade with suggestion more than substance. By contrast, the evidence for natural normativity is fairly obvious, and the traditional explanations can be articulated with a high degree of sophistication, coherence. 
In the third section, since my idiosyncratic interest in natural norms arises partly from my research in metaethics, I conclude by discussing one possible implication of natural normativity within ethical and metaethical conversations. 
In this paper, I draw from eclectic sources, but most from Aristotle, Philippa Foot, and Thomas Nagel. I take my readings of Aristotle and Nagel to be fairly standard; my reading of Foot, on the other hand, extends a bit farther into metaphysical speculation than she herself (following Wittgenstein) is interested in going. I take my thesis to be naturalistic in the broad sense: I am using philosophical and broadly scientific methods in an attempt to observe and explain natural phenomena, and bracketing divine revelation or the existence of supernatural beings. Furthermore, my thesis is naturalistic in that one important governing assumption of ethical naturalism is that humans are continuous with nature (Brown 2009). This naturalism I shall use to push back against one kind of objection. 

Norms
First, what is a normative fact? A normative fact “is what corresponds to a true normative statement” (Schaber). For reasons of space, I shall ask you to join me in simply assuming normative realism. So, value-statements, reason-statements, and ought-statements are refer to different norms. (I will use “norm” and “normative fact” interchangeably). “You ought not hit strangers with a skateboard” is a moral statement, but obviously, not every ought is a moral ought (Thomson 2001). “You ought to drink some hot lemonade” is a prudential norm (Thomson 2001). Drinking the hot lemonade is something you aspire to, rather than a description of how you are behaving. If you do not, your throat may remain sore. Importantly, not every norm uses the word ‘ought’. For example, “Eyes are for seeing,” is a description of their function, purpose, or the end-directed activity of that system. “Eyes are for seeing” is a normative and descriptive statement — that’s what eyes do and what they ought to do. Eyes that cannot see are defective qua eye. “Wolves hunt in packs” is a normative and descriptive statement. 

The basic thesis
So, the basic structure of the argument is this: there are two phenomena, two natural facts, that are best explained by the reality of natural normativity. If those two natural facts are real, then norms are part of nature, nature is normative. 
Consider those two natural facts: the first is end-directed (teleonomic) behavior of natural entities (eyes see, trees grow, stomachs digest); the second is the essentially normative (teleological) cognitive and practical activity of natural humans. The best explanation of each of these facts, and of both together, is that nature is normative.  By nature is normative, we could also say that there are natural teleological laws, natural norms, final causes, natural ends, natural functions. 

Aristotelian Categoricals 
“Wolves ought to hunt in packs” is a statement Foot calls an Aristotelian Categorical (Foot 2002). An Aristotelian categorical is a statement of logical form neither universal nor particular. That is, to assert that all A’s φ is not to distribute φ-ing to all members of the category A, nor simply to assert that some A’s that we have observed were observed φ-ing. 
For example, “all reptiles lay eggs” as universal categorical statement admits no exceptions.  The discovery of a new reptile, say, that gives live birth would not be the discovery of a defective reptile, but a discovery of a new species of reptile. Or rather, it would mean that either this newly discovered creature is not a reptile or that not all reptiles lay eggs. On the other hand, modestly confining oneself to a particular categorical statement like “some reptiles lay eggs” would be radically unambitious science. Our sample size of reptiles that lay eggs is enormous; we are justified in making the inductive leap that all reptiles lay eggs. 
Aristotelian Categoricals, then, are neither simply universal nor simply particular categorical descriptions. They are normative/descriptive judgments. And they are also formed by observation and induction. For example, we observe that many As do indeed φ, and we infer that A is supposed to φ, A is for φ-ing.  Categorical are inductive generalizations with a normative character.  We have observed a sample of A’s φ-ing and we inductively infer that (perhaps) all A’s φ. On the basis of the generalization, the observation that a particular A does not φ does not refute a simply, universal predication but identifies a defect in that particular A. When we observe an exception to a categorical we do not ipso fact debunk our categorical nor are obliged to re-interpret our observation. When learn that all wolves (say) hunt in packs, and observe a wolf hunting alone, we do not debunk the principle that wolves hunt in packs. (Nor do we think that we have discovered a new species of canine that is morphologically and genetically identical to a wolf!) Rather, we have observed that not all wolves are doing what they are supposed to do, not all wolves perfectly exemplify their lifeform.

A Presumptive Case for Natural Teleology
The presumptive case of natural teleology is this. 

	A. Argument for Normative Facts

	1)	If a normative statement is true, it corresponds to a normative fact. (Normative realism)
	2)	Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement. (From observation and induction). 
	3)	Therefore, eyes are for seeing corresponds to a normative fact. (From 1-2)

	B. Argument for Natural Normative Facts. 

	1)	Further, if a normative statement is true about natural entities, then there are natural normative facts. 
	2)	Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement about a natural entity. 
	3)	Therefore, there are natural normative facts. 

Argument (A) assumes normative realism for premise 1.  We learn premise 2 from observation and induction: an Aristotelian Categorical descriptive/normative statement: Eyes are for seeing (stomachs are supposed to digest, wolves hunt in packs, humans ought to think rationally, or what have you). (I) delivers conclusion (3), that there are normative facts. Then, argument (B) provides a simple variation on (A). True normative statements about natural entities correspond to real natural facts. Such normative facts are natural and not merely human, psychological, or projected. And (2) is, I take it, obviously normative and about a natural entity (not something man-made). So (B) delivers our thesis, that there are natural normative facts. 

Objections: It seems that nature is not normative
Let’s consider just a few of the powerful objections to this line of thinking. 
	1.	The first objection is that it is false that eyes are for seeing. Some will say, “Eyes that do not see died out; eyes that see were preserved naturally.” 
	⁃	As far as I can tell, evolutionary backstories about what eyes are and what eyes do has nothing to do with whether they have a real, end-directed function. There is disagreement about whether explanations undermines or underwrites teleological explanations (Brown 2009). All that I need for my argument to work is that possibly evolutionary backstories underwrite natural teleology. The only reason to assume that natural selection is undirected by natural teleology is dogma. If so, call me a heretic. 
	⁃	But is it really possible to doubt that eyes are for seeing? That eyes see is an empirical observation. That eyes ought to see, that eyes that cannot see are defective, is, I insist, equally empirical. It is just as empirical and no more theory-laden than other scientific observations like “all reptiles lay eggs.” 
	⁃	I save one more response to this objection in the last objection.
	2.	A second objection is to cling to an image. On one very powerful picture of the world, nature is a realm of pure descriptive facts. Nature is “bald”, “disenchanted,” and purely physical (McDowell 1996). Nature is an interlocking system of relations, spatial, temporal, and causal. Nature is “the world of quantity, as against the world of quality; of objects as against consciousness… of that which knows no values as against that which both has and perceives value; of efficient causes (or, in some modern systems, of no causality at all) as against final causes.” (Lewis 1943). Some call this the Laplacian picture (Plantinga 2011). On the Laplacian picture, norms are final causes, teloi, ways, and hence must be merely psychological. The Laplacian picture is the scientific picture of nature. So the assertion of norms is unscientific.  
	⁃	By all means, let us be scientific. I have an unwavering pro-attitude toward whatever earns the honorific title of science. If teleological laws are not discovered by scientific methods, then normative facts remain mere hypotheses or pragmatic assumptions or unshakable illusions. But the fact that eyes really are for seeing disproves the Laplacian picture of science. Natural normativity is scientific, and its denial is unscientific. It is empirical, and its denial is dogmatic.  
	3.	A third objection. The existence of natural teleology depends heavily on inferences to the best explanation. But “best” explanation depends in part on background beliefs. If one of our background beliefs is that we believe on good inductive evidence from scientific methods, that there are no natural norms, then appeal to normative facts to explain apparent normative truths like “eyes are for seeing” is blocked. So, on best scientific methods, we must deny the appearances: either normative realism is false, or normative natural facts are merely descriptive with the illusion of normativity. 
	⁃	By “scientific methods”  we mean one of two things: Firstly, when some people say “facts discovered by scientific methods” they do not mean a method at all but a doctrine, in this case, that normativity is not natural. But we can dismiss the dogma since I have given a case that, all things being equal, normative truths (described by Aristotelian Categoricals) are indeed apparently real and are indeed explained by inference to normative facts.  Or, secondly, some people mean by “scientific methods” those  that sometimes use the inference to the best explanation.  Scientists do use inference to the best explanation (abduction, hypotheses, explanation). It is a tool in the scientific tool belt. It is, in fact, ineliminable part of the scientific method. 
	⁃	And that is the kind of inference we used. The explanation of teleological phenomena (by teleological laws) may be wrong but it is not in the wrong ball park. It may be unscientific in the sense that any datum, theorem, proposition, law, or statement that turns out to be false is — ipso facto — unscientific. But it is not unscientific by being simply non-scientific, by being different from the scientific enterprise the way that street lights, rhetorical questions, and Cinderella movies are non-scientific. 
	4.	This is not strictly an objection: but someone might be thinking that the doctrine of natural norms is unpopular, and therefore probably false. If it were true, wouldn’t more scientists believe it? More philosophers of science? More philosophers? More people? My only response to this is that philosophical fashions come and go, and perhaps this particular fashion of denying teleology rests on a mistake; regardless, we can and should consider the argument on its own terms. I have argued that observing natural norms is an empirical business; who knows but that we may see natural normativity becomes the new, justified, scientific consensus? 
	5.	A fourth, very different objection. Suppose we grant that humans are supposed to think rationally is a norm, and a norm about human nature. We are, as a species, capable of advanced cognition and practice. (Those of us who think irrationally and act irrationally are, when we do so, defective.) So why not just explain the appearance of natural norms, of final causes, of purposes, of natural ends, by a combination natural selection and human projection? We are projecting our insides onto nature’s insides. When really, nature has no “inside,” no subjectivity, no consciousness. 
	⁃	Strangely enough, such an explanation divorces humanity from nature. It makes humans mysterious, radically discontinuous, opaque, anomalous, and queer. Since I am here assuming that humans are continuous with nature, I reject an account of teleology that makes it natural only to humans but unnatural to the cosmos as a whole. Furthermore, I have studiously avoided using too many uncontroversial examples of human normativity, preferring the more controversial (and hence more interesting) examples of non-human normative facts. 
	6.	A fifth, and also very different objection. Stephen Brown objects that arguments from an observation that A φ’s to the conclusion that A ought to φ prove too much, since it can be applied not only to non-humans but to non-living things. For example, we could “prove” that our hydrogen star is for radiating energy to the earth; the sun engenders life so therefore it is supposed to engender life. But this seems absurd: tthe sun does not have a purpose, a natural normativity. This is an objection about scope: if there are norms in terrestrial nature, do they extend to the whole cosmos? My presumptive case argues are really real and really natural but may be taken to prove only that norms exist for organic natural entities.
	⁃	On the one hand, I am perfectly content to rest my case. If I have persuaded you of a more modest conclusions, that normative laws obtain only in humans; or they obtain only in living organisms, or even more ambitiously, that they obtain only in organic systems (both organisms and their organs). 
	⁃	On the other hand, Thomas Nagel (2012) makes the case in Mind and Cosmos that teleological (and hence normative) laws are natural to the cosmos as a whole, including inorganic matter. I think there are two good reasons to be maximally ambitious about natural normativity. They are both reductios: suppose that there are natural normative facts about only organic entities, not non-living entities like the soil and the sun. Then we must affirm that when life appeared on earth, a new kind of case appeared as well: final causes. A new natural fact that was never there before, normative natural facts appear. For 13 billion years prior, there was only chance and efficient/material causes. Suddenly, and accidentally, the universe produced not only a new entity but a new kind of fact: normative facts. This sounds to me absurd, though if it does not sound so to you, I’m not sure how to persuade you otherwise. It makes more sense, I think, to suppose that natural normativity was there from the Big Bang forward. A second reductio: In the first objection, we considered that natural selection undermines the appearance of teleology. The problem is that natural selection does not apply to inorganic entities and systems like the soil, the sun, and the stars. There is no interstellar process analogous to genetic drift and the extinction of maladaptive traits. This also sounds to me absurd. The alternative, then, is more likely true: natural norms just are features of all of nature. Teleological normative laws are another brute kind of natural laws. 

Conclusion about Metaethics: Norms unite human nature and non-human nature
What is particularly exciting to me about natural normativity, if it is true, is its implication for ethics. I want to suggest, in closing, that the non-human stuff of the cosmos (quasars, deer, comets) and the human stuff of the cosmos (you and me) share a common structure, and that this underwrites many ethical claims. 
Descriptive natural laws describe formal relational structures at any given moment, a set of stable relations between natural entities; normative natural laws describe relational structures across time; a set of consistent end-directed relations between natural-things-as-they-are and natural things-as-they-ought-to-become. So the explanation for human end-directed behavior and non-human end-directed processes is the same: natural norms. 
Julia Annas puts it this way:  “What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already…” (Annas 1996). Natural normativity underwrites the belief that non-human nature and human nature share a common structure. This is just what ethical naturalism predicts. 
That structure is both formal and final, both descriptive and normative.  And discovering that structure is the joint task of philosophy (metaphysics) and science (the philosophy of nature), since experimental and theoretical methods are both fruitful. This is just what naturalism predicts. 
Ethical living is when we aim to become what we ought to become. Honesty, promise-keeping, rationality, prudence, moderation, perseverance, can be plausibly presented as traits that enable us to become what we are already are and what we ought to be.

            <Title>Naturalism's Demarcation Problem</Title>
            <Text>One of the key sub-conversations within metaethics is the naturalism/non-naturalism debate. Ethical naturalists, at least in this context, are moral realists of a certain sort. Namely, they think moral facts exist in the world but not in a supernatural or nonnatural realm of value, Sellars’ “space of reasons”, Popper’s “third world”, Plato’s heaven, or some such. Moral facts exist right here in this world of people, stars, gold, mountains, algae, deer, and human civilizations.  Whatever this world turns out ultimately to be like (atoms? superstrings?) we will be able to give an account of moral facts in the same privileged terms that feature in our accounts of physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology — or perhaps even just physics. Eventually science will out. Such is the faith in the scientific enterprise(s) and in the ultimacy of nature. 
Now, naturalism as a philosophical program or school of thought — metaphysical naturalism or “naturalism per se” — has its critics.  Successful is Naturalism?; Naturalism in Question; Naturalism Goetz and Taliaferro, Against Scientism. 
And its proponents are cool, confident, and collected. “The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized.” (Papineau 2007)
But an embarrassing number of philosophers admit that ‘naturalism’ means almost nothing. 
	•	“The term ‘naturalism’ has no very precise meaning in contemporary philosophy.” (Papineau) Papineau avoid the definitional issue with this apologia: “Rather than getting bogged down in an essentially definitional issue, this entry will adopt a different strategy. It will outline a range of philosophical commitments of a generally naturalist stamp, and comment on their philosophical cogency.” 
	•	“The term ‘naturalism’ remains contentious and subject to equivocation, misunderstanding, and abuse.” (Brown 2008, 2)
	•	“Naturalism has been held by many to be synonymous with ‘atheism.’ It need not be, of course, though what it actually means to reject supernaturalism is not so clear. If by ‘nature’ we mean ‘everything that is’, then of course there is nothing outside nature, so supernaturalism is rejected almost as an afterthought… nature is, more or less, what our latest and best science tells us it is… those entities countenanced by our latest and best science. What comprises those entities would require a treatise on naturalistic ontology” (Brown 2008, 2-3). 


In this essay, I survey the rich diversity of uses of the term ‘naturalism,’ and probe for some common significance (or a few significances) that unite them. 
Some of the possibilities are tautologous. (“Naturalists believe only in what is real and have knowledge of only what is true.”) 
I propose a novel definition of naturalism that captures the “spirit” of naturalisms. That spirit is a belief in the continuity of existence and the continuity of knowledge, their unity and harmony within themselves and with each other. 
I then revisit, in light of this probing discussion, naturalism’s two most commonly admitted substantive commitments: atheism and scientism. 
As for atheism, naturalism is either just atheism (in which case why call it by any other name?) or it is a belief in continuity of nature, which limits the kinds of gods that count as naturalistic but does not exclude gods per se. And it is not just atheism. So it is, I conclude, the belief in the continuity of nature and science. But nature is defined by everyone (above) in terms of science. So naturalism is, we might say, just a belief in (modern, empirical) scientific methods. 
As for science, our investigation into naturalism shows that our definition of science needs renovating — or rather, that some of the horrifying confusion that has gripped our discipline for the last hundred years needs dispelling, and some of the damage needs undoing. 
The demarcation problem within the philosophy of science impinges on our definition of nature, creating an iteration of the demarcation problem I’ll call the “demarcation of nature problem.” Science is either just knowledge or it is only part of knowledge (the empirical part). But science is not just the empirical part of knowledge, because math, logic, physics, computational science, and so on are not empirical. So science is just knowledge. In which case, nature is either everything that is knowable by any legitimate (empirical or non-empirical) methods of knowing. Since we can know about numbers, souls, and God by legitimate methods of knowing, mathematics, psychology, and theology are sciences. 
So the constraint “nature is only what is countenanced by the sciences” includes theology. 
The inevitable conclusion of this inquiry is that the naturalism/non-naturalism debate is bankrupt. It is not clear enough about its terms to sustain serious critical reflection. Ethical “naturalists” are either just materialists (moral facts are material facts) or they are no different from ethical “nonnaturalists” (moral facts are something real). 
This kind of merely terminology dispute, and the fact that it has continued for so many decades, is an embarrassment to our discipline. 
Instead of arguing about nature, we need to straightforwardly say what we mean: either moral facts have nothing to do with God or gods, or they do. 

——
The naturalist, as he hopes to define himself, is either a reductive physicalist or else his views are any and every possible philosophical view sans theism. Naturalism is either physicalism or atheism.

The problem is that the self-definitions offered are either fatally vague (even if coherent) or else clear and incoherent. We ought to eschew vague self-definitions just as willingly as incoherent ones. 

Naturalism’s demarcation problem is that “nature is what science studies” either includes formal sciences like mathematics, logic, and theology or excludes them. If it excludes them, then “nature” can not include metaphysically real abstract objects. If it includes them, then “nature” can include the Judeo-Christian God. The number of self-defined “naturalists” who want to include abstract objects but exclude such a God are many. But their problem is, how to do it? Can it be done? </Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>In the last five chapters, we have seen why there is excellent reason to believe moral realism is true and seen both theoretical and practical benefits of following a broadly Aristotelian virtue ethic. We have also seen that the metaethical theses belonging to  empirical moral realisms are inadequate to explaining our ethical lives, the way that our evaluative thought, talk, and action is vastly diverse yet unified under a single or a few evaluative predicates, like ‘good’, and ‘true,’ and ‘beautiful.’ 
We have articulated the four objections from naturalism, all of which amount to the discontinuity objection: that human nature and human rationality, on Aristotelian virtue ethics, are painted as radically discontinuous with nature, as “other,” as something sui generis and apart. 
Finally, we have critiqued some versions of “naturalism” that are, frankly, unthinking, dogmatic, and incoherent. We have given an account of science that is defensible and coherent, which delivers an account of naturalism (which defines itself with reference to science) that is also coherent. From the ashes we have argued for a novel version of naturalism that accommodates the core concerns of naturalists but is defensible against the iterative demarcation problem. 
In this chapter, I return to the four objections and spell out exactly how neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is naturalistic in our new and defensible sense of the term.

David Brink, Moral Realism
Overview:
Synopsis:
Reflections:
"We begin as (tacit) realists about ethics. Moral claims make assertions, which can be true or false; some people are morally more perceptive than others; and people’s moral views have not only changed over time but have improved in many cases (e.g., as regards slavery)." (Brink 1989, 23)

Moral realism is a defeasible presumption, like realism about the external world.  Michael DePaul summarizes Brink's book on Moral Realism as follows: "A commonsense view of the objectivity of science" and 'ethics is or can be objective in much the same way.' (Brink p. 6, DePaul p. 731). 

He says Brink combines "Externalist moral psychology, coherentist epistemology, non-reductive naturalism, and utilitarianism"

Brink critiques expressivism and prescriptivism by noting that "we can make moral judgments with no intention of expressing one's feelings and with no intention or even hope of influencing others' conduct" (Brink 26). 

Internalism about moral motivation at least is the view moral motivation follows inevitably upon the acceptance of a moral concept. (David Sztybel)

Brink notes a frequent boast of noncognitivists that since their theories commonly analyze ethics in terms of feelings or attitudes, they can better account for moral motivation, whereas merely agreeing to the “fact” of objective value need not motivate at all, as David Hume observed. The thesis that moral motivation follows from accepting moral ideas is called “internalism.”  

One objection to moral realism is the claim that moral facts are not causally important to the physical or non-moral world, that they do not feature in explanations of non-moral facts. "It has been said that moral facts even if they existed could not explain any nonmoral facts. However, Brink gives the plausible example that someone intending to keep a promise, a moral fact, helps explain the nonmoral fact of what they actually set about doing in the world" (Sztybel 6). 

Brink and Boyd are both utilitarians (or welfarists?) but Brink does not reduce happiness to pleasure or preference-satisfaction. 

Some objectively valuable things include: 
"…certain character traits, the exercise of certain capacities, and the development of certain relations with others and to the world, and that the value of such a life is independent of the pleasure it contains and whether or not this sort of life is desired or would be desired in some preferred epistemic state." (Brink 221)

##Abstract Draft 1

Virtue ethics has gained a resurgence of attention in philosophical as well as psychological and popular conversations about value, human life, happiness, and doing well. Philosophical naturalisms — from the very strict to the more liberal — have also been on the rise. 

The momentum of philosophical naturalism may continue until all of nature, life, the self, the cosmos has been subsumed under objective, third-personal categories and explained in objective, descriptive terms or else philosophical naturalism’s momentum may be checked by its inability to account for one or more features of (really real) reality. The putative entities that so far have resisted naturalization often include mind, consciousness, reason, practical reason, and value. As such, the naturalist ought to be interested and hopeful in finding or creating an account of value as virtue and of virtue as natural in some salient sense, or at least showing that one is in principle possible. A non-naturalist ought to be interested and hopeful in showing that any such account is in principle impossible, or at least that all such actual accounts are false and inadequate. 

This dissertation defends the thesis that all accounts thus far proposed for naturalizing virtue are inadequate, and that such an account is likely to be impossible, while giving due consideration to what the author judges to be the best naturalistic accounts of value and virtue, including reductive, eliminative, non-reductive rationalist, and non-reductive virtue ethical accounts. 


##Abstract Draft 2


Virtue theory, though resuming its popularity in analytic philosophy, has never quite disappeared from folk morality nor broader academic discourse. 

The criterion for an adequate metaethics is a satisfying explanation of those phenomena that puzzle us in life as lived, namely certain facts about human evaluative discourse, facts about our reasons for acting or not acting. 

Virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is such an explanation, in that it gives accounts for each puzzling explanandum and for all of them as a set.  

Other theories are not so satisfying. For instance, naturalistic neo-Aristotelian virtue theory either sacrifices virtue at the altar of (an ambiguous and ultimately vacuous version) of naturalism or sacrifices (the desired version of) naturalism at the altar of a robust virtue theory. 

Naturalistic ethical theories of a consequentialist sort that may be called  “welfarist” ignore all goods but human goods, and all human goods but human welfare and those actions that are liable to lead to human welfare. These theories, however sophisticated, have flaws — and moreover are woefully unambitious. 

Naturalistic ethical theories of a more scientific flavor also set out to explain explananda but ultimately resort to ignoring or denying the appearances — in other words, they refuse to explain at all. Ignoring phenomena that call for explanation does not do; especially if the explainer continues to help himself to virtue theoretical terms and concepts in daily life while denying their truth and adequacy in theory. 

Ultimately, metaethical and ethical theory (discourse about what is good per se and what is good for us) needs enrichment from virtue metaethical theory (specific discourse about virtues, happiness, practical reason) to be fully satisfying. And the ultimate question is not whether such neo-Aristotelian virtue theory is “naturalistic” or not; the contentious question is whether it is theistic or not. The question is not whether one can be good without God but whether one who is good can explain goodness without including a god in the account. Finally, the ultimate question is not whether we can get by without a god in our account — we can’t — but whether the god is us or someone else. Such questions are, of course, beyond the scope of an inquiry into metaethics. But likewise our theological stance can and should take clues from what seems most the most reasonable metaethical theory.

##*Abstract Draft 3*

Normative realism is rarely contested because it is so obviously true; moral realism is very often contested but is probably true as well. Virtue theory is making a comeback but is still hotly contested and the truth value of its various (often diverse) theses is far from settled. Naturalism is the new orthodoxy. So a primary research goal is to construct and give naturalistic accounts of normative realism, moral realism, and virtue theory. 

Virtue theoretical terms and concepts (not to mention the ethical history) can enrich our most plausible metanormative realist account. However, virtue theory challenges certain naturalistic assumptions that, however desirable they may seem, are at best vague, or trivial, or tautalogous and at worst simply false. 

A list of criteria is given for any adequate and satisfying metaethical account. These criteria are explandanda drawn from live as lived.  An account satisfying these criteria -- and explaining these explananda  is given.  This account is a virtue theoretical account that both draws support from metanormative realism and gives support to metanormative realism. Though it is incomplete and subject to important objections, the account is no worse off than rival accounts which have similar holes and suffer similar objections. 

Ethical naturalisms that are morally realist are considered. Neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism is found wanting. Scientifically naturalist moral realism is found wanting. 

Final clarifications and objections are considered. 


## Draft 4

The task of metaethics is to explain why an adequate ethical theory explains life as lived, gives order and direction to all practical thought, and makes some people extraordinarily good. 
The metaethical question of the last few centuries in analytic philosophy has been whether ethics can be naturalized. Various strategies have been proposed by affirmers; various nihilist views have been proposed by deniers. 
Two suppositions have animated this dialectic. The first is that moral or ethical realism is a defeasible presumption. We should be moral realists unless we have sound reasons not to. Moral realism is taken to be one or more of the theses that there are some moral facts, that moral knowledge consists in thinking about the moral facts, and that truth-apt moral discourse aims to represent such thoughts and such knowledge.  The second supposition supposition has been that naturalism gives sound reasons.
The naturalist objection to moral facts (and moral knowledge and moral discourse) amounts to three intuitive propositions: Nature is continuous — including human and non-human nature in a unified plurality. Ethics is endemic to humanity. And, nature is quantifiable, physical, mechanical, reducible. 
While showing the wisdom behind the three intuitive propositions of naturalism, they are shown to be misunderstood in their core import and in their application. The dialectic about nature must be clarified before we make any hasty restrictions on what kind of ethical theory will be “respectable.” Having clarified nature, it is possible to see that moral realism is incompatible with materialism, but compatible with both theism and humanism or atheism. 
In reality, naturalism gives no sound reasons to reject moral realism. Moral realism, as defeasible presumption, remains the most plausible metaethical explanation of the phenomena of life as lived. </Text>

“However, she then turns to ask just how suitable the kind of natural facts characteristic of Foot’s account look, from within a developed space of reasons, for grounding the rational justification of morality. On her reading, the outlook is not good. But in her attempt to reconcile the apparently incommensurable views of these two neo-Aristotelians, Hursthouse pursues a laudable goal, since success here would contribute significantly to the appeal of their shared perspective. It would be significant to at least provide an outline for the reconciliation of two central Aristotelian themes, the role of human function and the role of a proper moral upbringing, in the rational justification of morality.”
Thompson’s essay adjudicates this issue: can natural facts be reasons for acting? The first answer is that yes, they can be reasons for acting without mediation through culture. The second answer is no: they can only be reasons for acting after proper mediation through culture, after being “imported” from bald nature into the space of reasons. 
Ferreira summarizes the two positions as “empirical naturalism” and “excellence naturalism.” Ferreira, “Reasons from Aristotelian Naturalism”. 
(Ferreira 2007)
What is wrong with empirical naturalism?
It cannot account for the enculturation of human values. Take for example the human practice of making and wearing clothing on top of our skin. Is this natural? On the one hand, it is clearly artificial. Beavers do not make, select, and wear their fur — it simply grows. Birds do not shop for new fashionable feathers. On the other hand, it is clearly natural. Ignoring speculative pre-historical history for the moment, the earliest archeological and written evidence tells about humans wearing clothing. We wear clothing “automatically.” But we make it from natural materials and wear or trade it “automatically.” So it is both natural and artificial. This is an acceptable introduction to the concept of second natural. For humans, clothes-wearing is second nature. 
What is wrong with excellence naturalism?
The remaining problem with excellence naturalism is… 
Developing Foot’s ideas about natural normativity, Annas says this:
“What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out, but was rendered invisible for many decades by the ascendancy of non-naturalistic theories of ethical discourse. (Once we appreciate it, we can understand why those theories have been so barren of insight.)” (Annas 1996)</Text>

It is, indeed a character trait—that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say “goes all the way down”, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset.”

The labor of the essays comprising this dissertation has been to defend the claim that human virtue is not (merely) a part of nature, and that virtuous humans are not (merely) part of nature, if by nature we mean the non-living or the living non-human parts of existence. 
It has not been my task to defend the claim that virtue is real. Moral nihilism or radical skepticism are still viable “outs” from this conclusion for those who want to avoid it but who are persuaded by the dilemma. In this chapter I would like to very briefly address the anti-realist or nihilist option. Building off the moral realist arguments from Shaffer-Landau, Thomas Nagel, Philippa Foot, and more, I defend the claim that the best understanding of the facts of our moral thinking and the best explanation of our moral behavior are the realist understanding and explanation. Other explanations are so obviously false that they can only be tenable in light of the threatening consequences of becoming a realist. Other explanations are not soothing, comforting — they bring us face to face with the “horror of the normative.”
Philippa Foot concludes Natural Goodness with an essay on Nietzsche and moral skepticism. Is skepticism a rational possibility? 

###Draft 2
The labor of these chapters has been to defend the claim that virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is the most adequate explanation we have of a non-trivial set of explananda that puzzle us when we reflect on life as lived, and that the question of whether such a theory is ‘naturalistic’ is misguided. Ethical naturalism, depending on how one takes the term, is either inevitably going to succeed or inevitably doomed to failure. Such a range of intension is not philosophically tolerable. Rather, I have argued, the unambiguous and meaningful question is whether we must opt for a theistic ethical naturalism or an atheistic ethical naturalism.

I. Moral metaphysics — are moral facts real or not?  Is morality more a matter of taste than truth? 
	If not, then either constructivism or nihilism. (Mackie)
	If so, then moral realism (on one taxonomy). (Plato)

II. Are moral facts properly basic, brute facts or based on further foundation — are they “stance-independent” or constructed by the persons or groups who judge them? 
	If stance independent, then moral realism. (Shafer-Landau; Nagel; Wielenburg; Foot?) 
	If stance-dependent, then moral realism/idealism (McDowell; Hursthouse.)
		If stance-dependent, do they depend on the person? Relativism.

II. Moral epistemology — is moral knowledge possible? And how do we learn about the moral facts, if there are any?
	If so, by rational intuition the same as mathematic and logical and modal facts? Self-evidence? Moral rationalism (Shafer-Landau) Foot?
	If so, by empirical knowledge, the same as everyday facts and scientific facts? Moral empiricism (Boyd) Brown? 
	If so, by special moral intuition? (Audi)  
	If not, then error-theory. 

III. Moral semantics — do moral terms refer? Are judgments with moral terms as the predicate significant? 
	If so, then cognitivism. 
	If not, expressivism. 
		If expressivism, then either emotivism, prescriptivism, norm-expressivism, etc.


IV. Moral naturalism — are real moral facts natural facts?
	If so, ethical naturalism.
		If so, are they facts about natural kinds? (Boyd)
		If so, are they facts about human beings? Railton (Brown)
		If so, are they facts about humans relation to nature? (Nagel? Foot?)
	If not, non-naturalism. 

V. Moral motivation and action— are moral reasons necessarily motivating?
	If so, internalism (?)
	If not, externalism (Shafer-Landau)
	Are moral facts normative (rataional) norms? 
	How is it that moral facts set an appropriate standard for our behavior?

            <Title>## Section I: Excellence in Being For the Good</Title>
            <Text>Adams’ theory of virtue builds, in some ways, on his metaethical theory in Finite and Infinite Goods. 

For Adams, to be virtuous is to be for the good. ‘Being for’ is to be understood as a dispositional attitude, a stance, a direction, an overall disposition. But one can fail to be for the good in the proper way. Hence, to be virtuous is to be excellent in being for the good. 

Adams criticizes but builds upon the views of Thomas Hurka (2001 %). For Hurka, virtues are higher-level intrinsic goods involving morally appropriate attitudes to other (independent) goods or evils. Hurka is a virtue consequentialist. He notes that on one view virtue is a “disposition to produce what is otherwise good or to do what is otherwise right” (call these primary goods) in which case virtue is of only “derivative and instrumental significance.” (2001, 3%). On the contrary view, however, virtue is itself a primary good. On such a view, good and right are goods only derivatively.  Hurka’s account is “intermediate between these extremes” (2001, 3 %). Hurka’s account is not a rival to consequentialism but “satisfies consequentialist assumptions” while giving an account of the intrinsic goodness of virtue and intrinsic badness of vice (2001, 4).

            <Text>We have seen MacIntyre’s argument that a-teleological ethics is purposeless ethics. We have seen that much of modern moral theorizing is such purposeless ethics — a set of abstract rules (supposed to satisfy the demands of universal duty) or a set of actions (supposed to be likely to cause the desired consequences) devoid of historical context and social content. And we have seen that the restoration of teleological virtues, in their social/traditional context, makes the whole *quest of life* intelligible, including the practical reason needed to live well and the moral virtues needed to avoid temptations to live poorly and to become fully human. These teleological virtues we grounded in human practice. 
We have seen with Foot that there may indeed be *biological* grounding for teleological virtue as well. As Aristotle observed, and as any present day observer can confirm for himself, there is a parity between the *the nature of living beings as they appear to us* and functional and semantic properties in our language (both words and grammar). If this is right, then the Great Platitudes that living virtuously is living a *fully human* life is vindicated. We are required by practical rationality, by our social nature, *and* by our biological nature to develop virtues like loyalty, promise-keeping, courage, and practical wisdom. Furthermore, we vindicated the presumption that a special sort of deep happiness (contrasted with pleasure) is the natural, intrinsic result of the excellence or perfection of our nature (social, psychological, biological, etc.). We contrasted Foot’s theory which McDowell critiqued as “empirical naturalism”  with Stephen Brown’s similar theory and argued that Brown more justly falls under that condemnation than Foot. 
The recurring theme of these explorations has been what the Great Platitudes say about human nature as creatures in the broader cosmos. We saw with John McDowell how the fear of “spooky” metaphysics compels some to sharply distinguish human nature from nature as a whole; to transpose human “second nature” or culture on the vast, interlocking matrix of space-time and energy that is the dominant image of Laplacian nature. But McDowell’s brand of neo-Kantian idealism promises more than it delivers. When pushed, the dichotomy between nature / human nature collapses under the pressure of the absolute or unrestricted conception of nature and a restricted conception. McDowell wants nature to be restricted, but the line restricting it leaves mysterious everything outside nature. When he wants it unrestricted, then he cannot exclude (except by definitional fiat!) the supernatural entities or properties he is spooked by. The upshot is that McDowell’s theorizing is vulnerable to being ransacked by an Aristotelian realist (like myself) who plunders the realism while discarding the physicalism, anti-realism, or idealism. McDowell’s objections to such a plundering can in-principle contain no adequate rejoinders.

            <Title>Quietism: Thomas Nagel </Title>
            <Text>###Stubborn Rationalism in Thomas Nagel

Thomas Nagel is one of those frustrating thinkers who allude to and interact with many but cite or name only a few.  

One of our governing questions in this dialectic has been: how do we know good from bad, right from wrong, desirable from undesirable when we in fact know it? This question assumes quite plausibly that we know the good at least some times and in some ways.  What does it mean to be good or right or desirable and how did we come to knowledge that X was such?
Thomas Nagel’s view is that morality is objective, that moral values are really real, that moral knowledge is possible, that there are moral truths, etc. and etc. For Nagel, “objective” means that reducing all values to merely subjective (in various senses of the term) is impossible, both theoretically and practically. The alternative then, is some kind of objectivity. He says, “The problem of the place of value in the natural world... has to do specifically with the practical domain — the control and assessment of conduct.” When the dust settles on long and complicated abstract discussions of the foundations of value, we still have to do something with our lives. And we cannot psychologically nor logically assert consistently that our choices of what to do are based on no reason. 


There are two senses of “objective” that can be opposed to Nagel’s sense of “subjective.” The thinner sense is that we can’t help but treat it as objective, whether it is or not — this sense remains agnostic. The thicker sense is that we can’t help but treat some value as objective and the reason we psychologically or logically cannot do so is because it is really objective. This sense of objective is, by Nagel’s own argument, a hypothesis to explain a psychological or logical  impossibility, but it is a very good hypothesis. 


Nagel’s position here is that normative judgments are truth apt. He says, “Normative realism is the view that propositions about what gives us reasons for action can be true or false independently of how things appear to us, and that we can hope to discover the truth by transcending the appearances and subjecting them to critical assessment” (View from Nowhere 139). However, he is quick to distinguish this answer from various answers to Question 3 — what makes evaluative propositions true. He assures us, “it is not a form of Platonism. The claim is that there are reasons for action, that we have to discover them instead of deriving them from our pre-existing motives— and that in this way we can acquire new motives superior to the old” (139). So his answer to Question to is a staunch yes, but he wants to distinguish that affirmative from various ways of spelling out exactly how to explain truth aptitude. He says, “perhaps a richer metaphysic of morals could be devised, but I don’t know what it would be” (139). 


His stance here may seem simply stubborn. But it is not. He treats objective values — like the freedom of the sort relevant for moral accountability and self-responsibility — as a “defeasible presumption” (VFN 143). The burden of proof is on those who wish to argue that there are no objective values and no objectively true value judgments, or that putatively true value judgments like “we ought to treat others as equal to ourselves” are not even truth apt. Like the reality of some item of the external world, the reality of an objective value can be defeated in individual cases, as when a long-cherished value judgment is exposed as a mere prejudice or instance of groupthink. But when I learn that a mirage is not real or a prejudice is false, I rightly conclude that some appearances are deceiving and that some products of groupthink are false. I do not — and should not — jump to the conclusion that all is appearance or all is prejudice. Just because some X are Y does not entail that all X are Y. We can only totalize a local exposoure of non-objectivity into global subjectivism if we make that invalid inference or hasten to hypothesis that unlikely explanation. 

Now, the explanation is more likely on the assumption that “if values are real, they must be real objects of some other kind” (VFN 144). As the external world realist, so long as the moral realist can defend the mere possibility of objective value, the presumption of objective value remains the default position (VFN 143-144). He says, “If I have a severe headache, the headache seems to me to be not merely unpleasant, but a bad thing. Not only do I dislike it, but I think I have a reason to try to get rid of it. It is barely conceivable that this might be an illusion” (VFN 145). Such glaring truths of daily experience may be puzzling against a background of physicalism, but it is not thereby to be abandoned. 


Thomas Nagel may be considered radically uncurious about the metaphysical question. He is right, I think, to say that metaethical questions often confuse the normative questions — or rather that only by retaining focus on the primary normative questions can we keep perspective on metaethics.

            <Text>## Metaethics and Ethics  

### Moore and after
Metaethics in its modern form began with G. E. Moore’s *Principia Ethica*. Of course, the questions that concern modern metaethicists were posed and discussed by prior thinkers. However, the *Principia* gave a distinctive form to these questions and suggested a distinctive range of possible answers. We shall see how Philippa Foot and others dispute the validity of that form and that range. For now, it is better to summarize a bit of Moore’s thinking and the legacy his thinking created. 

Moore argued that all previous ethical philosophers had failed to resolve their disputes for a failure to define their terms. The question of what the word ‘good’ *means* (and, possibly the same question, what ‘good’ *refers to*) is distinct from the question *which things are good?* The first question is a conceptual question that aims to define a category. The second question is a substantive or existential question that aims to bring other concepts within that category. 

Moore argued (or according to some critics, *assumed*) that ‘goodness’ was indefinable. That is, the good could not be defined in terms of any other property. It is false that ‘goodness is pleasure’  or ‘goodness is whatever is most real’. That we pursue pleasure is a psychological claim, not an ethical one; that we judge something to be real is a metaphysical claim, not an ethical one. 

#### G.E. Moore, The Naturalistic Fallacy

If the good is indefinable, then any attempt to define it is going to fail. Any attempt to reduce the concept to a concept of lesser intension, or to translate it it as a concept, commits the “naturalistic fallacy.” Moore is clear that the naturalistic fallacy isn’t *just* the error of defining the good as a natural property (such as the pleasant) but also the error of defining the good as a metaphysical or supernatural property (such as the Really Really, or the Divinely-Ordained). 

#### Ethics

Moore’s book comes down from its metaethical heavens back to the normative earth. He argues that whatever is good intrinsically can be known by direct moral perception. Whatever is good instrumentally can be known a posteriori through probabilistic reasoning about causal links between actions and their effects. Whatever necessarily brings about (or tends to bring about) intrinsically good states of affairs is instrumentally good. 

Intrinsic goods, for Moore, are three: aesthetic pleasure, friendship, and knowledge.

#### The Legacy 

Moore set off a firestorm of debate on this issues. By the account of most of my five key authors, Moore’s legacy is largely a tangent from the deeper philosophical questions within ethics. </Text>

            <Text>Can objective moral truth be known by any rational observer, regardless of the agent’s moral character, point of view, background beliefs? 
Robert Fitterer (2008) argues that some emotions, especially an agent’s love, is a precondition for seeing the objective ethical truth. Hursthouse (1999) is somewhat sanguine about denying that ethical truth can be achieved from an “external” third-person perspective — what particular ethical judgments shore up our continued reflection? Thomas Nagel (1989) thinks that objective and subjective standpoints are both valid even though they sometimes contradict. Alasdair MacIntyre is famous for asserting that all arguments, including his own, issue from within a “tradition” and can only be judged from within that tradition but also denying that his position leads to relativism. Talbot Brewer’s (2009) passionate plea for a retrieval of ethics is also a retrieval of the self — he shies away from Iris Murdoch’s more gutsy locution: recovering the soul. 

In this essay, venture into these treacherous waters. My inquiry shall follow the lead Anscombe, MacIntyre, Murdoch, and Brewer. My antagonist, not through ill-will but through a need for dialectical interlocutors, will be Hursthouse and Nagel. Nagel is too pessimistic that the “objective” viewpoint is the scientific one — assuming as he does (and many others) that empirical and quantitative science is all there is to science; instead, I propose, optimistically, that the subjective viewpoint is scientific, since theoretical and qualitative science are also science. And Hursthouse (and with her, John McDowell) are too optimistic about the Neurathian project of rebuilding our ethical outlook from within, without being impinged upon by objective (stance-independent) moral reality that is “out there.” The correct balance — no, not balance: the correct union of wild optomism and wild pessimism is in Robert Adams, for whom simply being for the good is enough to begin one’s journey to objective moral truth; but being for the good is only a beginning, with a thousand distractions and obstacles that get in the way to becoming truly virtuous. 
In the virtue ethical framework we have been developing, there is only one narrative: our life is unfolding dialectically along cognitive and practical lines, as we strive for wisdom and for virtue. Each step of “progress” is not progress for the human race or the culture but for the person progressing. 






Fitterer first demonstrates how certain cognitive operations set out in Aristotelian virtue ethics can indeed arrive at objective moral truth precisely through the contribution emotions make in moral discernment. Then, drawing on Lonergan's notion of inductive insight, he argues that objectivity is the result of the properly functioning subjectivity of a moral agent. Finally, building on his study of Nussbaum's ethical writings, Fitterer concludes that compassionate love is an attitude that actually fosters the likelihood of discerning and choosing the genuine good, and encourages objectivity in moral decision-making.</Text>

            <Text>##Terence Cuneo - The Normative Web

Terrence Cuneo’s fascinating book builds an argument for moral realism on the key premise that “if moral facts do not exist, then epistemic facts do not exist” (The Normative Web 90). This premise leads us, if we affirm the antecedent, to the “undesirable results” of having to affirm that epistemic facts do not exist. Once we affirm that epistemic facts do not exist, it follows that we do not believe anything, let alone that view, on the basis of epistemic facts. 

Moral facts are thought objectionable by some for their ‘queer’ features, such as (in the words of Lenman’s review of Cuneo): 
(a) the supervenience of moral facts on other, prosaically descriptive, facts
(b) the intrinsically motivating character of moral reasons
(c) the inescapable or categorical character of moral reasons
(d) the supposed mysterious nature of moral facts in failing to fit neatly into a naturalistic picture of the world
(e) the failure of moral facts to play a role in explaining other facts -- or a sufficiently rich range of such facts
(f) the great extent and apparent intractability of moral disagreement.

David Enoch agrees. 

“Why are people so suspicious of morality, robust-realistically understood? Sometimes the worries are metaphysical – moral properties, or truths, or facts, or values, or duties, or some such are said to be metaphysically queer, not to find a comfortable place in a naturalistic worldview, and so on. The merits of such worries are a matter for Chapter 6, but my point here is much more limited: if you think that things like the purported fact that we ought not to humiliate others is metaphysically queer, you should be equally metaphysically suspicious of things like the purported fact that two-boxing is the uniquely rational policy in Newcomb’s Problem. If you find it hard to metaphysically stomach things like the value of humanity (or the negative value of pain), you shouldn’t (prima facie, at least) find the value of excitement more appetizing. If the scientific worldview can’t find room for the wrongness of murder, it is hard to see how it can find room for the irrationality and (sometimes) irresponsibility involved in wishful thinking. The metaphysical worries about morality seem to just be instances of metaphysical worries about normativity more generally.

More or less relatedly, some suspicions about morality (robust-realistically understood) are epistemological in nature. If there are truths of the kind that the Platonist (say) envisages, how is it, it is sometimes asked, that we can have epistemic access to them? And if we can’t, should we conclude that on this view none of our moral beliefs are justified? And isn’t this a reductio of this kind of Platonism? Again, a discussion of the merits of this and related objections will be postponed, this time until Chapter 7. But for now the crucial thing to see is that the epistemological challenge – whatever exactly its details – seems to apply just as forcefully to other, non-moral normative truths and facts. So here too, the objection to Robust Metaethical Realism is just a particular instance of an objection to a similar view about the normative as a whole.” (89)

Cuneo’s “Interlude on Naturalism” interests me greatly (101-4). 

&gt;To this point I've traversed some fairly familiar territory in contemporary metaethics—four variants of Mackie's celebrated ‘argument from queerness’.20 I want now to interrupt the flow of the discussion for a moment to make a general comment about what is going on in these antirealist arguments and to draw out a further implication of my argument.
&gt;The four lines of argument we've considered hinge on the claim that, were moral facts to exist, they would be objectionably ‘mysterious’ and, hence, we have excellent reason to believe they do not exist. While it is fairly commonplace to hear philosophers say such things, it is not always so obvious what is meant when they do so. Imagine an outsider listening in on this discussion between moral realists and antirealists—one who, say, is used to wondering about whether there are four‐dimensional space‐time worms, (p.102) closed space‐times, event‐horizons, or universals. She might find herself deeply puzzled by the discussion thus far. What, after all, renders moral facts more objectionably mysterious than these other kinds of putative entities? And why should this oddness count against the existence of moral facts?
&gt;I take the answer to be that the antirealist thinks that moral facts are mysterious in two ways. They are mysterious, first, in the sense of being anomalous; moral facts don't fit into our best picture of what the world is like. Moral facts are mysterious, second, in the sense that they are impenetrable. We have no illuminating account of their nature or behavior. Of these two senses of mystery, I judge that it is the first that is doing the most work in the antirealist's arguments.21 So, let's focus on it for a moment.
&gt;That nothing is brutely anomalous I take to be a truism. Entities are always anomalous relative to some set of assumptions or background picture of what the world is like. And it is no secret that the background picture against which moral facts are supposed to be anomalous in the arguments we've considered thus far is a naturalist picture of the world.22 Almost without fail, antirealists object to moral facts because they appear to fit so poorly into the world picture science is supposed to give us. Simon Blackburn puts the point particularly vividly in his essay ‘How to Be an Ethical Anti‐Realist’, when he writes that moral antirealism is ‘demanded’ by a naturalistic worldview and claims that, according to moral antirealists, ‘moral properties . . . are not in this world at all, and it is only because of this that naturalism remains true’.23 If Blackburn is right, a necessary condition of naturalism's being true is moral realism's being false. Now my own conviction is that this is not the sort of thing a naturalist ought to say. According to a popular and broadly Quinean understanding of naturalism, the naturalist's creed is that we ought to follow science wherever it goes. (p.103) Arguably, however, accepting this creed is incompatible with claiming that naturalism implies that moral realism is false, for we cannot rule out a priori that science may reveal that there are moral facts and, hence, that moral realism is compatible with naturalism.24
&gt;Be that as it may, what I would like to point out is that, if naturalism implies that there are no moral facts and if this claim implies that there are no epistemic facts, then naturalism gives us strong reason to believe that there are no epistemic facts. If, however, my overarching argument is correct and there are epistemic facts, then we have good reason to believe that naturalism—at least of the kind that is driving the arguments we've considered—is false. The apparent price of tying naturalism so closely to moral antirealism is, I suggest, to increase the vulnerability of the naturalist project.

In a footnote, Cuneo criticises our contemporary use of the term 'naturalism', deprecating it as a "philosopher's weasel-word" that "admits of a great variety of incompatible meanings" [@cuneo footnote 22.] [^9]

[^9]: Cuneo says: "(22) Blackburn (1993), Ch. 9 and (1998), Ch. 3, Gibbard (1990), Part II, Horgan and Timmons (1990/91), Mackie (1977), Ch. 1, and Timmons (1999), Ch. 1, are explicit about this. In my estimation, the term ‘naturalism’ is a philosopher's weasel‐word, which admits of a great variety of incompatible meanings. In some senses of the term, I believe that moral and epistemic realism are compatible with naturalism. My use of the term borrows from Rea (2002), Ch. 3.

Cuneo’s core argument he phrases like this:

* (1) If moral facts do not exist, then epistemic facts do not exist.

* (2) Epistemic facts exist.

* (3) So, moral facts exist.

* (4) If moral facts exist, then moral realism is true.

* (5) So, moral realism is true. 

The first premise he calls the ‘parity premise.’ The argument in its favor rests on four “salient respects in which putative moral and epistemic facts are similar” (Cuneo 225).  The second stage of the argument for the first premise shows that all of the “standard objections” to the “objectionable features” of moral facts, should they exist, would also establish that epistemic facts display the same objectionable features. 

Cuneo constructs “epistemic analogues” of three “prominent forms of antirealism” in Chapters 4-7. But each of these strategies for avoiding epistemic realism are false. The first form of antirealism is nihilism of the sort that claims there aren’t any epistemic facts and so there aren’t any epistemic reasons to believe anything. It follows that there is no epistemic reason to believe anti-realism. Epistemic nihilism can be discarded by all of us who are “minimally rational.” 

The second strategy is “epistemic expressivism.” This strategy is very sophisticated. However, Cuneo pushes the view into a disjunctive critique where expressivism either captures much of our ordinary epistemic discourse but entails that all such discourse systematically misapplies epistemic concepts or doesn’t capture our epistemic dicourse at all since it entails that all such discourse does not “involved the application of epistemic concepts at all” (226). The upshot is that epistemic expressivism collapses into a skepticism not far different from nihilism. 

There is one other form of antirealism I do not summarize here. 

Even so, Cuneo has some clean up work to do. He discusses three other objections to his core argument. 

“The more expeditious manner of proceeding, which I shall adopt, is to concede that the standard objections to epistemic realism considered in Chapter 3 have some evidential force. But, I suggest that, even if we concede that at least a subset of these arguments creates problems for epistemic realism, then at best what these arguments establish is that the epistemic realist must countenance some metaphysical mysteries. If we grant, for example, that the standard objections are right to assume that supervenience relations are brute determination relations not amenable to explication, or that we have no informative account about how we apprehend epistemic facts of certain kinds, or that epistemic facts fail to play a wide explanatory role, then it follows that epistemic realism implies the existence of phenomena that are impenetrable—at least to agents with a cognitiveconstitution in an environment such as ours. (If the argument of the last chapter is correct, epistemic reductionism is really no different from realism in this respect; it is no less mysterious in these respects than is realism.) I submit that countenancing mysteries of these types, while perhaps not very attractive in some respects, is a significantly better theoretical option than embracing wholesale epistemological skepticism. Accepting mysteries of these types is, for example, not as such irrational; indeed, arguably, were there mysteries of this sort, they would be among many other mysteries that philosophers must accept (issues regarding the nature of intentionality, qualia, free choice, numbers, and so forth, spring to mind.) Embracing radical skepticism, by contrast, is irrational, for one cannot be a minimally rational agent and accept that there is no reason to believe anything. And on the plausible assumption that, if given a choice between accepting two incompatible positions, the acceptance of only one of which is compatible with being minimally rational, then we should accept that position” (Cuneo 241-2).

I take it that any ethics based on virtue requires an account of the good life which the virtues enable us to achieve.1 On this issue of the good life most modern forms of virtue ethics are naturalistic, and often take a form called neo-Aristotelian, harking back to the best-known naturalistic theory from antiquity, Aristotle’s. When we are investigating what the good life is, these theories hold, and how living virtuously might achieve it, we are aided by investigating our human nature. This in turn we do by seeing how we humans are a part, though a distinctive part, of the world that the sciences tell us about.” (Julia Annas, “Virtue Ethics: what kind of naturalism?” Virtue Ethics, Old and New, edited by Stephen M. Gardiner. Cornell, 1996. 

The alternatives are metaphysical or religious virtue ethics and non-naturalistic virtue ethics. She calls the first one a “perfectly possible form” but does not discuss it further. She calls the second “more radical” and argues that we should not be “tempted” to it. The reason is that it treats humans as non-continuous with nature. 

Developing Foot’s ideas about natural normativity, she says this:
“What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out, but was rendered invisible for many decades by the ascendancy of non-naturalistic theories of ethical discourse. (Once we appreciate it, we can understand why those theories have been so barren of insight.)” 

In this section, I aim to explore a theistic virtue ethics. I have been at pains to specify that “theistic” does not mean non-naturalistic. </Text>

            <Text>## Philosophical Ethics


### How do we live well? 

How do we live well? This is the first question of life that human beings, upon arriving at the age of reflection, ask. It is also the first question of ethical philosophers. 

Ethics is the discipline of practical reason. There are ‘right answers’ in ethics since there are right ways to live one’s life, there are wells to live well and ways to live poorly; things can go well or badly for us. One of the fundamental governing assumptions of this work is that there is no special domain of the moral. Value theory is a whole package. There is at bottom no intelligible distinction between morality and prudence. Morality is not a special domain of practical reason but is the whole domain of practical reason. 

How did this broad sense of morality as living life excellently narrow? 

### How did the meaning of ‘morality’ narrow? 

Practicality as a whole domain was sub-divided. 

First, it meant any particular way of life — something like idiosyncrasy, habit, character. Second, any practical lesson — something like the “moral of the story”, the point, that to be acted on, the rule, the maxim. Third, a domain of rules of conduct that are “neither theological nor legal nor aesthetic”[@macintyre1984 39]

The conventional distinction that “morality” is a special sub-division pertaining to right and wrong behavior toward others traces to the 1700s, where “immorality” meant sexual misbehavior.  The conventional separation of “moral” from “non-moral” considerations traces to John Stuart Mill who divided the former domain as concerned with duties to benefit and to not harm others. 



### Ethics, Morals and Practical Reason

The word “ethical” is sometimes taken to have a broader connotation than the narrow “moral,” but I think such distinctions etymologically suspect. As MacIntyre summarizes: “‘moral’ is the etymological descendant of ‘moralis’. But ‘moralis’, like its Greek predecessor ethikos — I invented ‘moralis’ to translate the Greek word in the De Fato — means ‘pertaining to character’ where a man’s character is nothing other than his set dispositions to behave systematically in one way rather than another, to lead on particular kind of life.”[@Macintyre1984after 38] The early uses of Moral did not contrast with “‘prudential’ or ‘self interested’” nor with “‘legal or ‘religious’”. MacIntyre concludes: “The word to which it is closest in meaning is perhaps most simply ‘practical’.”

In the older, broader (and I think more sensible) sense of the term, it would not sound like nonsense to assert that, say, driving on the right side of the road in the US is the moral thing to do — it is a more, a custom. And following the customs and mores of a culture is *the thing to do*. 

As one MacIntyre scholar puts it: ‘The term practical rationality is derived from Aristotle’s *phronesis*. It is to be distinguished from *sophia*, a more technical form of reasoning. Practical rationality leads to more approximate conclusions; it takes context and relative facts into account, and it usually leads to moral or political conclusions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 60-61] 

Rosalind Hursthouse likewise says that: “The concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its possessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or admirable person who acts and feels well, rightly, as she should. These are commonly accepted truisms.”[@sepvirtue] 

There is more to being an admirable person than *avoiding* transgressions. Admirable people command our respect for their brains, their guts, their strength, their rare talents, their outstanding achievements, their unimaginable creativity, their wit and eloquence. In a word, we admire *what they do* with *what they are given*. 

When we moderns confusedly think of “morality” we are really thinking only that part of morality pertaining to non-maleficence, or avoiding the harm of others. 


### Three Dimensions of Practical Reason

Now, the domain of non-maleficence is a real domain. Duties and obligations pertaining to others is a legitimate division. But the division is not between morality and non-morality but between different types of morality or sub-domains. I shall call this domain “2nd-personal morality”, that is, my duties to *you* or to *you all*. This domain is vast. But there are *other* domains for the 1st-person and 3rd-person. 

The entire set is the domain of practicality — what one *ought to do* or ought to think, say, etc. The three sub-domains are defined by the object with regard to which one ought to do and not do this or that. 

The domain of 1st-person morality is proper respect and care for one’s self — self-love or enlightened self-interest. (This is what Mill called the domain of “prudence” and sharply distinguishes from “morality.”) It includes the virtues that benefit both oneself and others (moderation and courage) but especially practical wisdom, without which none of the other virtues do me much good. 

The domain of *3rd-person morality* is a bit harder to articulate. It is proper respect and care for everything that is not *you or me.* That could include animals and plants, pets and work animals, our possessions, our earth and environment, and perhaps even our solar system. The primary virtue of this domain is justice, a respect for the whole and the proper arrangement of all the parts. If God exists, then 3rd-personal morality would require piety to him or her, since on most theisms God is not strictly speaking “one of us” and so the appropriate responses or behaviors (allegiance, sacrifice, or what have you) are of a different order from self-regarding and other-regarding virtues. 

The domain of 2nd-person morality, I said, is vast. It includes interpersonal moral obligations, values, and virtues as well as broader social or political ones. I suggest that the dominant virtue here is not only justice but love — i.e., a strong regard for the other, a charitable orientation to promoting the good of others, refusing to harm them, and committing to protect them from harm. But we shall return to these themes. 

For now, I only want to make it clear the distinction between "morality" (qua the value of nonmaleficience and perhaps benevolence) and morality (qua the value of doing good and avoiding *all* kinds of evil, of discovering and executing *"the thing to do"*). 

### Consequences

What hangs on this distinction? Many things. I’ll give a couple of examples. 

#### Internalism/Externalism

The internalism/externalism debate within metaethics is in part about whether moral facts are objectively prescriptive.[@smith2007externalist 233] Smith distinguishes two facets to this question: first, is the concept of a moral fact simply the concept of an objectively prescriptive and *motivating* feature of the world? Mackie, and Smith, think Yes. Second, do any such moral facts obtain? Mackie thinks no, Smith thinks yes. 

While Mackie would deny that there are any such *moral* facts, it would be much harder for him to deny objectively prescriptive epistemic facts, or prudential facts. To deny that there is ever a *thing to do* is to commit oneself to explaining *all* action and *all* deliberation in other terms. When we deliberate about what to do, we are *only* deliberating about what we wish would come true, what we want, what we prefer, what we desire, etc. We are not trying to figure out *what is the best course of action*. 

Smith discusses the amoralist challenge in David Brink’s work[@smith2007externalist 234] The amoralist Brink (and others) imagine is aware of moral demands “yet remains unmoved”. But we cannot simply let this example into play without scrutiny. My worry about the example is that the amoralist here is that although the amoralist is not moved or claims not to be moved by “moral” considerations he is obviously motivated by something; he has practical reason — the ability to act on reasons, to behave this way and not that way on purpose, the ability to undertake projects, and so on. The amoralist needs more detail. Is he an egoist? If so, then he denies that nonmaleficence is an objective value and affirms *only* autonomy or prudence is an objective value. The egoist is regularly immoral (by our standards) but not because he denies objectively prescriptive features of the world across the board but because he thinks only the pursuit of *his* good is worth the effort. 



### Defense?
I believe this fundamental assumption of mine is defensible. But it is not defensible a part from the details of the metaethical virtue theory I am trying to work out in the remainder of the book. That is, the critic who arrives at the conclusion of the book and objects to that conclusion may either object to one or more particular chapter or particular claim, or else she may object that such governing assumptions themselves have lead us astray. 

The only defense I will offer now is not so much a defense but a strategic rhetorical reversal of the burden of proof. It is this: why assume that there is a special domain of the moral? The ancient and medieval philosophers in the west thought of the domain of practical reason as a natural unit: all that is voluntary or under our control may be done well or badly. Our goal in living well is to to identify what to think, what to do, and what to make. As a corollary, we must identify what not to think, what not to do, and what not to make. But shrinking the whole domain of practical reason down to the domain of a few absolute prohibitions on harming others is a modern innovation. If it is right, then it is a modern invention. If it is wrong, it is a modern ignorance. Either way, its proponent needs, I think, to offer some account of why such a shrinking amounts to progress rather than regress in moral theorizing.

            <Title>### Other disclaimers - my tradition</Title>
            <Text>## Disclaimers and Miscellany

### My own views

One of the key technical terms we will learn from Alasdair MacIntyre is *tradition*. For MacIntyre, a tradition is a socially-embedded argument. Each of us is raised within a tradition. 
I speak from within the broad tradition of western civilization, which has argued since Plato over fundamental questions about goodness, reality, truth, beauty, and knowledge. I consider myself an Aristotelian, not in that I agree with every jot and tittle of his complete works, but in that I and many if not all westerners are descendants of the Greco-Roman culture that survives in Europe and America, and has in many respects spread to Asia, Africa, Russia, Australia and the world. 




But traditions are concentric; I am also an anglophone U. S. American from California. I count this as an exercise in American Ethics. Now, any philosophy that claims to be American must be in some way pragmatist. But method over doctrine doctrine means that the doctrines are fluid, flexible, in process, evolving. So those who resist my conclusions must either refute them or be branded enemies of progress. For a methodological naturalist who is consistent to deviate from the present orthodoxy is not a complaint but a necessary project demanded by present orthodoxy. Just as to be a single called organism is to cease being single called but become multi-celled, to be human is to become transhuman. 



I am a born-again Orthodox Christian. Only in the later chapters do I revisit some of these questions from the unique vantage point offered by the Christian narrative, which is just the vantage point offered by seeing all of Christ’s creation (especially ourselves) in light of Christ. In this and in the subsequent chapters leading up to that final one, I restrict myself to the Aristotelian tradition. Firstly, I wish to seek common ground with my atheist, rationalist, or humanist readers who share with me not a common faith but a common civilization. Secondly, I wish to find out as much about nature and human nature by the light of reason, philosophical reflection on experience, and empirical study.

I count this as an exercise in Greco-Roman-Euro-American philosophy.


### Audience

My audience are not merely those who (like me) trust, admire, worship and obey Jesus. My audiences are those who admire but do not worship, trust but do not obey.  These might be agnostic, spiritual but not religious, or atheistic. But I do not presume atheism in this work. I presume that all evidences, physical, psychological and social are on the table. All experience and all science and all reason are for me sources, but no revelation other than the revelation of reason.

I hope in future work to explore those questions of especial interest to us who have more resources available to answering them, like Alvin Plantinga and Robert Adams.

### A double danger
My goal is not to write from within my tradition as a theist and indeed a Christian. The resources available for thinking about virtue are much greater. Rather, if the church to which I belong is a citadel on the hill, and the broader western tradition is a city spread out like a wheel on the surrounding terrain, my goal is to leave the citadel and see how much work can be done in the city. Outside the city, of course, are the villages, towns, and countryside homes. And beyond that, wilderness. I shall not have much to say to the wild men who are utter moral strangers. 
The double danger of limiting myself to what can be said about virtue and nature from within a public and secular tradition is that both audiences are liable to misunderstand me: fellow theists or fellow Christians in particular may assume that I ignore the extra resources available to me out of disbelief or ignorance; fellow westerners who do belong or might belong to the tradition of Aristotle will assume that I consider the more narrow domain of secular discourse as a means of proselytizing for my faith, inching towards God. Both sides may think me either disingenuous or misguided. This is a danger that can be mitigated by explicit avowals of my true intentions. But such misunderstandings cannot be wholly guarded against. I think the reward is worth the risk. To detail neo-Aristotelianism and to give a novel account of naturalism that both theists and atheists or agnostics can consider, modify, and in part accept, is worth all the trouble. 

### The amoralist objection
My tradition accepts that it is good to be good and that we have a rational obligation to become virtuous. My tradition also generates an impressive list of virtues and a cohesive account of their relation and ultimate foundation. I do not pretend that this dissertation gives an account adequate to the task of *persuading* an amoralist, a moral skeptic, or moral nihilist. Then again, I’m not sure *any* account of morality could do that task. Plato’s *Republic*[@plato Republic, 621c] is devoted to (among many other things!) answering Glaucon’s hypothetical question: is virtue for its possessor better than vice? Why be virtuous? Is there *any* reason to be virtuous, excluding the admittedly external, contingent, or social benefits that accrue to the person who *appears* virtuous — such as honor, respect, position, friendship, etc. Yet even that book ends ambiguously with Socrates urging a *story* that “could save us, if we are persuaded by it”; as for Glaucon’s response… we hear only silence. Is he persuaded? Asleep? Still hesitant? Plato leaves us questioning. 

Foot *will* attempt to address the Nietzschean immoralist. Not being hungry for such an answer myself, I cannot judge whether it would satisfy someone genuinely undecided as to whether or not being being good is a good idea. 

My goal rather is to *clarify* and *elucidate* the tradition in which I find myself. This will mainly be of interest to fellow adherents of the tradition (broadly) of virtues. But it will be of interest to others in related or rival traditions. 

My position within my tradition renders impossible two goals — goals that are otherwise fine and admirable goals for someone to aim for. The first is the goal of persuading the amoralist. I leave that for others more worthy to the task.[@superson2009moral] The second is the goal of persuading the adherent of a rival tradition. Though MacIntyre occupies the center stage of only one chapter, the entire dissertation is undertaken in a *MacIntyrean* spirit. The best a member of a rival tradition can hope is for an “as if” account — a clear account that can serve the philosophical imagination of one who *already wants* to learn a “second-language” of another moral tradition.

            <Title>Non-cognitivms compatible with realism</Title>
            <Text>Thus a complete ethical theory and on adequate one will highlight and include the truths in the deontological system. And the utilitarian system. But it will transcend them.

	Very simply, the virtuous agent living well and wisely and being happy does her duties according to her roles and according to her rational nature and also brings about the best consequences in the world, and the most happiness for the greatest number. But she does not find in duty the soul motive for moral action nor expanding the happiness of all I.

	As for non-cognitivism, Alan Gibbard latest work is not only compatible with realism, that is I would argue a sort of realism.

	Gibbard's's latest work builds a moral theory around the human activity of planning. Plans, and our activity of plan formation, are for. Him the foundation of express exist Siri but also make moral discourse subject to rational constraints and make it exemplified logical relations that we expect of truthapt discourse. Plans can disagree with one another. Plans can be rational or irrational.

But on my view planning is just one paraphrase for practical reasoning, deliberating about what to do, or what is good.

            <Title>A Case for Natural Human Teleology</Title>
            <Text>The goal of this section, building on and extending MacIntyre’s account, is to establish the following two theses: 

Thesis 1: Human rational practice is essentially end-directed. (Human Practice Teleology Thesis)
Thesis 2: Human nature is essentially end-directed. (Natural Human Teleology Thesis)

In the following section, I will defend a third thesis: 
Thesis 3: At least some of nature is essentially end-directed. (Natural Teleology Thesis)

The three theses are closely related. I should say a word here about their relation before I present the cases. The fact that human practice is essentially end-directed is not so controversial. The controversy is over how to interpret or explain this fact. 
That human nature even exists is controversial (what is a ‘nature’?) and that it should be essentially end-directed is not widely discussed. My route to Thesis 2 is by way of Thesis 1. 

Argument 1: 
1. If human rational practice is essentially end-directed and human nature is essentially practical, then human nature is essentially end-directed. 
2. Human rational practice is essentially end-directed (From Thesis 1). 
3. Human nature is essentially practical.  
4. Therefore, human nature is essentially end-directed. 

If we can amass evidence that to be human is to act and to act for reasons, and if such rational practice (acting for reasons) is end directed, then we have good reason to think to be human is to be end-directed. 
Thesis 3 is, of course, the least likely to persuade a certain sub-population of readers. Many take a dogmatic opposition to the notion that nature (non-human nature, that is) is end-directed as a sort of creed (section 2, sub-heading 4a) of the scientific worldview. But in spite of the abundance of appeals to authority decrying natural teleology as heresy, we must assess the evidence. Indeed, there are only a few reasons to reject the age-old picture of the cosmos as an at least partly directed system. Atheism is not, by itself, sufficient evidence that the cosmos as a whole or certain (non-human) parts of it are not end-directed systems. It might be that, even absent a god or geist or alien intelligence or panpsychist world-soul directing nature, that mindless teleological laws are fundamental natural laws (along with gravity, strong and weak micronuclei force, etc.) operating on and shaping the development of the cosmos or of certain of its parts. But this is to get ahead of ourselves. 
There are two ways to conceive the relation between Thesis 2 and Thesis 3. The first is that 2 is evidence for 3. Let’s look at that argument, in brief, first: 

Argument 2: 
1. Human nature is essentially end-directed. (Thesis 2, from Argument 1)
2. Human nature is part of nature. (Assumption of Naturalism)
3. At least some of nature is essentially end-directed. 

Argument 2 is ploddingly obvious. If humans are natural objects in the same sense that dolphins and giraffes are natural objects — creatures that appear within the cosmos as a result of natural laws operating on normal physical stuff — and if human nature is essentially end-directed, then the conclusion is hardly an inference at all as much as a re-statement of the premise that human nature is essentially end-directed. An analogy: Grand Cayman ocean water is transparent. And the Grand Cayman ocean is part of the oceans of the earth. Therefore, at least part of the oceans of the earth are transparent. 

But there is another way of conceiving the relation between Thesis 2 and Thesis 3. Thesis 3, if it can be supported on independent empirical and metaphysical grounds, can actually furnish support for Thesis 2. A preliminary version of that case runs thusly: 

Argument 3a:
1. At least some of nature is essentially end-directed.
2. Human nature is part of nature.
3. Therefore, humans are essentially end-directed. 

Clearly, this argument is invalid as it stands. It takes the same form as the following true but invalid argument: At least some of the oceans of the world are transparent. The Pacific Ocean is part of the oceans of the world. Therefore, the Pacific Ocean is transparent. Argument 3 does not specify whether all of nature is end-directed (the notion of cosmic teleology) or if only parts which parts. So it would need a supplementary hypothesis like: All natural entities that are living are essentially end-directed. 


Argument 3b: 
1. At least some of nature is essentially end-directed.
2. Human nature is part of nature.
3. All natural entities that are living are essentially end-directed. 
4. Humans are natural entities that are living.
5. Therefore, humans are essentially end-directed. 

The biologist’s incorrigible operating assumption that organisms (and their parts?) have both functional forms and formal functions gives prima facie reason to think that living things are indeed end-directed. They are directed, for instance, toward life. And obviously humans are living things. So it would follow that humans are essentially end-directed. 

I will leave these theses as they stand for now and dive into the case that human practice is essentially end-directed. 

Thesis 1: Human rational practice is essentially end-directed. (Human Practice Teleology Thesis)






Thesis 2: Human nature is essentially end-directed. (Natural Human Teleology Thesis)

Human nature is essentially rational 
Is human nature essentially and unavoidably teleological? If so, then it is essentially and unavoidably normative. 
To believe that, say, “to be human is to think rationally” is to believe the fundamental normative truth that humans ought to think rationally, that that is what we are supposed to do. The force of “ought” there is not a divine law ought, as Anscombe criticized. It is simply a reflection upon what as a species we are capable of attaining and what exemplary members of our species attain.  
We are (as a species) are capable of rational thought, barring the effects of birth defect, mental illness, impaired brain functioning from injury or brain-addling drugs, and so on. Those who for any reason outside their control do not attain to to any individual capacity for rational thinking are defective in a sad but ultimately non-culpable way. Those who for some reason in their control do not attain to their individual capacity (assuming that such capacity is set, in part, in advance, by genetic factors among others) are defective in a culpable way. They are, in a word, bad thinkers. I won’t go so far as to accuse bad thinkers of being bad people (I.e., morally bad), just culpably bad in an important respect. And of course, people are responsible only to actualize their individual member-specific capacity for rational thinking, not some abstract or generalized species-specific capacity for rational thinking. The greatest math geniuses in the world who sweat and labor over their discipline to master new frontiers are praiseworthy for cultivating their intellects so far; the greatest math dunces in the world who nevertheless sweat and labor to grasp the basics are praiseworthy for cultivating their intellects so far. Intuitively, there is no blame on the math dunce for not being born with a mathematically-wired brain. 
To sum up: commonsense beliefs about human beings “Humans are capable of higher-order, rational thought” distinguish us as a species from other animals. Moreover, they are normative.  Asserted explicitly as a normative statement, we make ‘ought-y’ judgments all the time, like “People should think things through,” or “Bob should not be irrational.”  Asserted implicitly as an abbreviated Aristotelian Categorical, we say things like, “we think rationally,” or “to be human is to be rational.” And these provide presumptive reason to think that human nature is essentially teleological. There are facts — facts we seem to discover rather than invent — about the way we are and the way we ought to be. 

Human nature is essentially practical (we are practical reasoners)
Take a second commonsense belief: A human being is a practical reasoner in a human community. I would venture so far as to suggest this axiom as a definition of our species. (It is more accurate than flat-nailed featherless bipeds.) We are social animals by nature, and we are practical animals by nature, and we are reasoners by nature. But, building on the above paragraphs about rationality, each is important. All three together pick us out better than any one alone. 
The intuitive evidences for this axiom are so abundant and ready to hand it is hard to know where to start. A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. Each of these situations, I hope, so familiar that my analysis will not (yet!) be controversial. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 
If this is true, the converse would be true: those who are not practical reasoners, or not in community, are not human. This corollary is the natural extension of the Greek view that exile was on par with, if not worse than, public execution. To remove you from your community is in an important sense to destroy you as a person. A hanging or poisoning only destroys you as a body. An exile is far worse than that. It rips you from your context, tears out from the social fabric the thread that you are. It turns you, while existing, into a non-being, a non-entity, an object. Regardless of whether we can sympathize with this way of thinking about exile, we can understand how one can be demoted from human status. 
We should not say that a non-praactical-reasoner is not human, but that they fail to be exemplary. Brain-dead, or mentally handicapped, or injured etc., persons are not non-human but they are importantly defective qua humans, as I think common sense can recognize. 

So are is human nature teleological? We have built a presumptive case from common sense that this is so. Human nature is what we are, and some (if not all) of the facts constituting what we are are normative facts about what we are capable of, what we ought to be.

Non-Reductive ethics



In this chapter, my goal is to give two accounts of how virtue might be naturalized. The first I think untenable and shall present arguments which have persuaded me to that effect and which I hope will persuade you. The second is not without its flaws, but it is tenable. It is, in short, the best theory we have going. When we are convinced that more empirical theories are false, and that virtue theories shackled down by empiricism are subject to the same fatal objections, we shall pursue with interest the problems and prospects of the second sort of virtue account.

            <Title>## How I deal with Objections</Title>
            <Text>## How I deal with Objections

One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocutors, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproariously funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocutors are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergraduates are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. 

Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to “let the dead bury the dead.” 

While writing a platonic dialogue is a form of art I still find appealing and still use, that is not the best vehicle for this dissertation. So I am forced to give the views I think mistaken the best hearing I can give them in my own voice. 

The challenge of metaethical inquiry, I think, is to engage readers who do not already agree with you. A constant danger to which we are all liable is assuming too many crucial propositions and arguing at length about a bunch of relatively peripheral propositions. Metaethicists who steer clear of this danger are the likes of Alan Gibbard and Robert Adams. There is some value to articulating, clarifying, and defending a view that reader and author both (already) share. But that is not the valuable enterprise I aim for. 

The test, I think, shall be whether these pages find readers who disagree with the core thesis I present, and if such can recognize "their own" purported view in the pages that follow. If they can not only recognize but resoundingly affirm the view expressed in that chapter, then my objections may have some bite and may earn the high honor of receiving a rebuttal. 

It would not be a failure if no one found these pages; most such essays do not find readers, even if they deserve them. Failure would be for some ethical naturalist to pick up the book or a chapter on a shelf or online, glance at the view expressed, and to disown what I claim is his own.

            <Text>The labor of the essays comprising this dissertation has been to defend the claim that human virtue is not (merely) a part of nature, and that virtuous humans are not (merely) part of nature, if by nature we mean the non-living or the living non-human parts of existence. 
It has not been my task to defend the claim that virtue is real. Moral nihilism or radical skepticism are still viable “outs” from this conclusion for those who want to avoid it but who are persuaded by the dilemma. In this chapter I would like to very briefly address the anti-realist or nihilist option. Building off the moral realist arguments from Shaffer-Landau, Thomas Nagel, Philippa Foot, and more, I defend the claim that the best understanding of the facts of our moral thinking and the best explanation of our moral behavior are the realist understanding and explanation. Other explanations are so obviously false that they can only be tenable in light of the threatening consequences of becoming a realist. Other explanations are not soothing, comforting — they bring us face to face with the “horror of the normative.”
Philippa Foot concludes Natural Goodness with an essay on Nietzsche and moral skepticism. Is skepticism a rational possibility? 

###Draft 2
The labor of these chapters has been to defend the claim that virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is the most adequate explanation we have of a non-trivial set of explananda that puzzle us when we reflect on life as lived, and that the question of whether such a theory is ‘naturalistic’ is misguided. Ethical naturalism, depending on how one takes the term, is either inevitably going to succeed or inevitably doomed to failure. Such a range of intension is not philosophically tolerable. Rather, I have argued, the unambiguous and meaningful question is whether we must opt for a theistic ethical naturalism or an atheistic ethical naturalism.

            <Text>### How I deal with Objections

One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocutors, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproariously funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocutors are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergraduates are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. 

Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to “let the dead bury the dead.”

            <Title>Why Shafer-Landau is a naturalist</Title>
            <Text>Russ Shafer-Landau has become a go-to defender of moral non-naturalism. And moral non-naturalism needs defenders. Since G. E. Moore, it is hard to come up with one non-naturalist name (Robert Audi) to every five naturalist names (J. L. Mackie, Alan Gibbard, Richard Boyd, Peter Railton, Philippa Foot). 
And yet Shafer-Landau is explicit that the debate within metaphysics between naturalism and non-naturalism doesn’t amount to much. Non-reductive naturalists are, by his lights, virtually indistinguishable from non-naturalists. The taxonomy game devolves into a trivial debate over labels. (Here’s another interesting but ultimately trivial question: Should Montesquieu be classified as a political philosopher, a historian, a philosopher, a moral philosopher?)

            <Text>How Successful is Naturalism?


The essay from Nancy Murphy is especially helpful. It applies the MacIntyrian notion of tradition to theism and naturalism. 

"How successful is naturalism"
Two camps
Naturalism is no single entity. But its many forms can be grouped under two primary camps. Those two camps that have been variously described. 
These pair are characterized in different ways:
"strict" and "liberal" naturalism.(Goetz, Taliaffero, Naturalism)
"bald" and "relaxed" naturalism (McDowell, Mind and World, 89)
"hard" and "soft" naturalism (Gerhard Vollmer, "Can Everything Be Rationally Explained Everywhere in the World?" in How Successful is Naturalism?)
"reductive" and "non-reductive" naturalism ("How successful is naturalism?")
"reductive materialism" and "evolutionary naturalism" (Sellars, "Why naturalism and not materialism")
"Unrestricted" and "restricted" naturalism (Fink, "Three Sorts of Naturalism" in John McDowell: Experience, Norm, and Nature, Jakob Lindgaar, ed.)
What distinguishes the two?
The first camp is essentially a form of reductive physicalism, the descendent of the older materialism.
The second camp is a non-reductive physicalism, the descendent (arguably) of older theories like Stoicism, Aristotelianism, nominalism, naturalized platonism.
The first claims that it is currently able or one day will be able to reduce all branches of knowledge to physics, all branches of ontology to physicalist metaphysics, and all human psychology phenomena to neurophysiological phenomena. This claims that "second nature" (humanity) is just a part of "primary nature", the spatio-temporal manifold. 
Everything can be described from the third person perspective. 
The second claims that the things of "the human spirit," first-person consciousness, rationality, morality, and so on must not be reduced in our scientific picture of the world. "Second nature" is part of nature but is not merely a segment of the spatio-temporal manifold. Humanity and all that is human cannot be described exhaustively from the third-person perspective, but must be described in part from the first-person perspective. 
What unites the two?
Why are both of these widely diverging schools of thought called naturalism? There seems to be a sociological contributing cause: naturalism is a positive word for us. All who want respect and esteem scramble to lay claim to their membership in the naturalists club. But it can't be all that. There is also a rejection of the supernatural. So is naturalism just atheism? If so, why develop a different name for atheism? Is 'naturalism' just a way for atheists to say I "I don't believe in God but I do believe in everything else." 
Other classifications?
Hard naturalism is sometimes equated with scientism, both by those who accept the label and those who do not. (Rosenburg, Atheist's Guide to Reality) 
Sometimes so-called hard naturalism just claims that unqualified title. (Drees). Sometimes so-called soft naturalism just claims the unqualified title of "naturalism" (Sellars). 
Within the restricted form of naturalism, sometimes a distinction is drawn between idealism and supernaturalism. (Fink 2009; Sellars 1927).

What is naturalism? What is at stake?
Sellars says, 
"Let its concentrate now upon the differences between naturalism and materialism. It may be that we can find a clue in the distinction between cosmology and ontology. I would say that ontology is the more specialized of these two divisions of theory of reality or metaphysics. Materialism is distinctly an ontological theory, a theory of the stuff of reality. Its polar opposite is usually taken to be mentalism of some kind. Naturalism, on the other hand, is a cosmological position; its opposite is supernaturalism in the larger meaning of that term. I mean that naturalism takes nature in a definite way as identical with reality, as self‑sufficient and as the whole of reality. And by nature is meant the spaaaaaace‑time‑causal system which is studied by science and in which our lives are passed. The whole nature of nature may not be exhaustively known, but its location and general characteristics come tinder the above categories. Supernaturalism essentially affirms that nature is only a part of reality. This supernaturalism may be of the myth‑believing, popular type bound up with traditional religion or it may be quite opposed to the miraculous. For instance, nature is for Bradley only a part of reality and in that sense it is appearance. The status of matter for Plato is another instance of supernaturalism in this large sense." Roy Sellars, "Naturalism and Not Materialism.”

            <Title>Nature and God</Title>
            <Text>##Nature and God
Two broader metaphysical considerations merit a returning comment. The first is about the concept of nature. If nature is just that which is, then it is a truism and a tautology to say that naturalism is a true doctrine, where ‘naturalism’ is the thesis that only nature exists. Saying “only nature exists” just means, on this account, “only things with natures exist” or better yet, “only that which exists exists.” I dare say only a madman would earnestly disagree. 

So on the one hand the doctrine that only nature exists is true but trivially true. On the other hand, the doctrine is question-begging and (in my view) false. If “nature” is just physical stuff, then at least the statement “only nature exists” is synthetic and not tautologous. On this account, of course, naturalism cannot but be physicalist. There is no “relaxed naturalism” on this view. And it won’t do to assume physicalism without argument, especially in the face pressing reasons (from the ethical considerations about virtue inter alia) to believe some values and virtues and even our own human nature is not physical in this sense. But the present case is much worse than just begging the question. The attempt to clarify that takes “nature” to mean “physical stuff” will not do. Because the Greek word physis (φύσις) from which we derive “physical” — exactly like the Latin word natura from which we derive “nature — just means the inner core or essence or real substance of a given entity. To speak of God’s physical properties is quite literally to speak of what properties he has by nature, as opposed to by choice or convention or some other way. To say that the soul is physical is to say that the soul has it’s own nature, essence, form, underlying substance, hypostasis, or reality. At least, that is what those words might mean. So to assume that the very word ‘physicalism’ gets us to what we might want — a denial of spooky stuff — is already moving too fast, let alone assuming that the doctrine we are (futilely) expressing is true. 

What does the naturalist want to affirm or deny by claiming ‘nature’ as his own special metaphysical or epistemological ally? Perhaps she can take recourse to ostensive definitions. Ostensive definitions (like Frank Jackson’s) point to familiar exemplars of natural objects, tables, mountains, badgers, stars, etc. and define ‘natural properties’ as those ‘needed to give a complete account of things like them” (183, quoting Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics, p.7). First, a non-naturalist can “insist that moral properties” need be included in a complete account. Secondly, we cannot just assume that tables, mountains, badgers, stars are merely physical in that what appears to be is fully what is. It turns out that the table appears solid but is composed of an interlocking sub-atomic lattice shot through with empty space (or so we now surmise). Since ‘atom’ in Greek signifies ‘uncuttable’, the “atoms” of the early 19th century are not actually atomic; what seems to be uncuttable, the smallest elemental bit of matter, turns out to be composed of hadrons (either baryons or mesons), which hadrons are composed of quarks, which are composed of... etc. As scandalous as it may sound, not even physical things are necessarily just physical. </Text>

The chapters composing Part I are concerned with the claim that virtue is sufficient to make us happy. This claim resolves into two key premises that (a) humans qua practical reasoners even *have* a telos which virtues enable us to achieve, and that (b) “the” human telos (with the definite article) is something like “happiness” — taking happiness to be a concept determinate enough to be a helpful starting point but not determinate enough to be final. @annas2011intelligent  argues persuasively that happiness is a more “empirical, intuitive” notion than is commonly supposed.

The chapters concerning Part II are concerned with worries about metaphysical naturalism. This worry resolves into challenges to the claim that (c) human beings are natural, and that therefore (d) our telos and our virtues are natural.

Julia Annas, Platonic Ethics, Old and New

0. Introduction
She aims to examine Platonic ethics with an eye more to the so-called Middle Platonists than to Aristotle or modern scholarship, because they share (unlike even modern virtue ethicists) his eudaimonist presupposition and (unlike Aristotle) deeply care what Plato actually thought (2-3). They do not use the “developmental” approach (3-4). They think Plato’s view is that virtue is sufficient for happiness (5). Their view of Plato’s teachings on pleasure is (to us) fresh (5-6). They, and Plotinus, see how Plato connected happiness with becoming like God (6). 

1. Many voices
Plato is thought by the skeptical Platonists to have no doctrines of his own, but to commend a “model of philosophy” as “arguing against positions” (10). The later Platonists thought he had doctrines (11). Reading their interpretations disengages us salubriously from our own assumptions (11).

Does Plato have doctrines of his own? Socrates self-describes himself as a barren midwife but also propounds some doctrines. Plutarch helps us see that as teacher he only worked against the views of his interlocutors, while as philosopher he worked to elicit recollection (a la Meno) in his listeners/readers. The skeptical Platonists took it that the deconstructive work was successful and never made it to their own constructive views (passing scrutiny); the “doctrinal Platonists were more optimistic” (22-23). 

Tracking Plato’s development — if there is one — corresponds to his develping use of the historical Socrates, and finding the historical Socrates is hard. Stylometry hasn’t helped (26). Comparing with a clear and certain historical biography is impossible (28). Albinus, by contrast, treats the dialogues like a circle: no matter where you start, you will be able to track the whole shape (27). The common objection against unitarian interpretations is that they flatten out or ignore distinctions and contradictions between dialogues; developmental approaches do this too, and sometimes worse (29). 

The point is that it might be worthwhile to set aside the developmental/unitarian debate and read the ancients (30).

            <Title>The Key Ethical and Metaethical Challenges </Title>
            <Text>The Key Ethical and Metaethical Challenges
	Each of my six writers promotes a philosophical ethics that is both ethical and metaethical. This is not surprising. As Sayre-Accord (2014) says: it is no surprise that, in Plato's Republic, Polemarchus’ claim that being a just person enhances one's life developed quickly into a decidedly metaethical discussion of the origin and nature of justice. 
	Much of the resistance to virtue ethics in contemporary philosophy does not come from disagreement about whether perseverance is really praiseworthy trait or drunkenness really a blameworthy one; the resistance comes the difficult or dubious claims about nature (that it is teleological) and human nature (that it is essentially different from animals). 	
	So what metaphysical, epistemology, anthropological, and linguistic theses does a virtue ethicist need in order to underwrite her basic normative commitments? Neo-Aristotelian is widely viewed as “the official metaethical theory” (Lenman 2006) of a mainstream virtue ethical theory. Neo-Aristotelian naturalism is taken by its adherents to be a species of moral realism (and hence cognitivism), of ethical naturalism. (Whether it is best understood as a form of “stance-independent” realism or constructivism is an important question I shall consider below.) Neo-Aristotelians have a cognitivist semantic theory (albeit inchoate), a moral epistemology, a theory of motivation, and a philosophical anthropology. But this neo-Aristotelianism must be clarified and critiqued before it is defended. 
	I set myself the task of meeting seven challenges. The first four are primary ethical, the second four may be seen as metaethical. The seven challenges are as follows: 
	◦	First, assuming that virtues exist and are real, what is a virtue? Virtue ethicists struggle to articulate just what defines them all, what “virtues” are, and what the relationship is between virtue and happiness. There is unrest in the ranks. Each writer has a nuanced account that will bear close examination. Each account must contribute to our account. Virtues are human character traits,  (Hursthouse; MacIntyre; Foot; McDowell) but what kind? What non-controversial examples of virtues can we point to? Virtue is often defined in relation to happiness, as those qualities that contribute to or constitute happiness. What is happiness? 
	◦	Second, virtue ethicists struggle on the primary normative level to defend objections from rival approaches and from moral skeptics that the pursuit of virtue is merely egoistic, that virtues are culture-relative, that virtue norms are not action guiding (especially in the face of dilemmas), that it is self-effacing. 
	◦	Third, If we know what a virtue is, we can ask whether they are useful? An ethical theory is both practical and intellectual. It must be answer our questions but also give us at least some guidance, albeit general guidance, in living ethical lives. An objection on this point is that virtue ethical principles are not “action guiding” enough. A second objection is that they are action guiding but basely egoistic.
	◦	Fourth, there are metaethical challenges. Do virtues even exist? Aristotle thought so, and so do my exemplars in contemporary virtue ethicists. But the first objection to taking virtue ethics as our ethical theory may be the challenge to the very existence or coherence of virtues. Harman and R. Scott Smith pose versions of this challenge. The challenge must be met. 
	◦	Fifth, even if virtues exist, are they important or essential to our ethical lives and ethical theories? Not every ethicist who utters words like ‘virtue’ and ‘vice’ and ‘happiness’ and ‘wisdom’ is a virtue ethicist. Kant and Mill also discuss virtue, as recent scholarship has made clear. But they do not make virtue the cornerstone or even very central to their ethical theories. Picking out one differentium that all contemporary virtue ethicists share is, perhaps, impossible. But what plausible or ostensive conditions can we lay out that a virtue ethicist satisfies? 
	◦	Sixth, virtue ethicists of the neo-Aristotelian sort (those that constitute my focus in this dissertation) take themselves to be a species of cognitivism, moral realism, ethical naturalism. So it, like its consequentialist or deontological co-realists, suffers under the  burden of defending each of these positions against sophisticated non-cognitivism, moral anti-realism, and ethical non-naturalism. Is being moral justified? 
	◦	Seventh, there are questions of relativity and idealism. Even if we are cognitivists, should we be realists or constructivists? Thomas Nagel calls constructivism a species of subjectivism, while Hursthouse calls a view that is apparently identical a species of objectivism. 
	◦	Eighth, and last, there are broader metaphilosophical and cosmic questions about the relation of virtue ethics to naturalism and theism. I suspect that some of the psychological and social opposition to virtue talk originates not from intellectual objections but from stereotypes and guilt by association. Is virtue ethics metaphysically naturalistic? Or is it theistic? Plantinga argues that theism, not naturalism, is the scientific worldview (Plantinga 2011, p. 309). Virtue ethicists like MacIntyre (1981), Foot (2001) and Stephen Brown (2008) depend heavily on the concept of telos for overcoming the is/ought gap. Anscombe (1967) recommends virtue talk as an alternative to divine law moralities; yet Robert Adams (2006) recommends virtue talk as a complement to divine law morality. 
Each of our writers has something to say to some or all of these challenges.

            <Text>## Section 1: The Tradition of Virtue and Practical Rationality ##


### MacIntyre’s Project: An Invitation to Restore Virtue ###

Perhaps the core of MacIntyre's ethical writings has been the invitation to restore Aristotelian and Thomistic tradition of virtue.  MacIntyre extends this invitation to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. He says that he writes to "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.]

MacIntyre's influence has been remarkable. Many have taken the invitation. Sympathizers tend to be dissatisfied with the present modern culture of "emotivism" or moral nihilism. In such a culture, unmoored from its deeper past, shrill and intractable moral disagreement reign, and the only means of resolving disagreement is not rational appeal but moral manipulation. In such a culture, life has no apparent objective purpose and each individual has no ready-made identity out of which to discover a purpose. In the seventeenth century, such a culture was billed as a radical improvement on the older Aristotelian tradition. Liberal Enlightenment thinkers promoted a purely formal, disengaged freedom as a superior replacement to any more narrow, substantive goods that were thought to constitute human happiness and to unify political and social groups around a common goal.  

Non-sympathizers who decline the invitation to recover the virtues fall into one of two broad groups: the first (which MacIntyre calls “encyclopedists”) tend to be more or less satisfied with the theory and practice of our present modern culture; the second  (“genealogists”) agree with some of MacIntyre’s diagnoses but reject his prognoses. 

Encyclopedists might think that one or another moral theory — Kantianism, consequentialism, contractarianism, Humean sentimentalism, egoism (or even a particularly modern sort of virtue theory)  — is substantially on the right track. They might think such a theory, albeit imperfect, needs minor corrections but not a major overhaul. Encyclopedists tend to find MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. 

Genealogists think that Kantianism, utilitarianism, divine command theory, *and* virtue theory are *all* false. They are *all* just masks worn by contemporary prejudices. They often commit to immoralism, amoralism, error theory,[@joyce2013irrealism],  philosophical irony about morality (as well as metaphysics).  

The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) is not a demand -- it really is an *invitation.* Readers who are discontent with modern culture and morality may well find MacIntyre's solutions compelling. Readers who are not so discontent may find something of interest in his criticisms; if not, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would this be a good solution?"

With this reconstruction McIntyre took himself to be replacing a ‘biologically teleological’ account of virtue by a ‘socially teleological’ account – that is to say, one that ‘does not require the identification of any teleology in nature’ (p. 183, my italics). His target was the view that ‘[h]uman beings, like the members of all other species, have a specic nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos’ (AV, p. 139). Or, since it is primarily other species of animals that are in question here, the same target seemed close to the view that ‘[t]he standard . . . is set by man qua animal, man prior to and without any particular culture’ – a creature, as he went on, ‘of whom we know nothing . . . [and do not] actively meet in history’ (pp. 150–1).

### Section Introduction

MacIntyre's philosophy is highly interesting, but forms such an interconnected whole that it is difficult to pick out and criticize just one part. For those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are “historically extended arguments."</Text>

This dissertation defends four claims: It argues that (a) commonly accepted virtues of the mind and will (such as courage, justice, moderation, and practical wisdom, wisdom) are perfections of human nature in practice, that (b) such virtues are necessary for human beings as such — i.e. the task of becoming  virtuous is *a categorical imperative,* a perfect duty, an unconditional obligation that also has the best consequences, makes the most people most happy; that (c) only virtuous people are happy (but not all virtuous people are happy) and a second-order claim that claims (a)-(c) are compatible with metaphysical naturalism correctly understood.  

These are age-old themes. Treating them adequately is the task of a lifetime, not a single dissertation. Yet they are worthy themes. Even an inadequate treatment of a worthy theme may hope to attain some value. 

To render these themes more manageable, I limit my scope to the ethical writings of five contemporary "neo-Aristotelian" virtue theorists: Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Robert M. Adams. Each chapter offers a treatment, however incomplete, of one of these thinkers. Each chapter elucidates key insights and defends what I take to be true in these insights.

The first three claims are liable to be seen by some as platitudes. The fourth is perhaps still lively and controversial. Regardless, there are objections to all these claims. Just as importantly, there are objections to *the assumptions undergirding* such claims. The articulation and defense of these claims proceeds in a pattern not strictly linear. Each chapter is sensitive and responsive to a given thinker -- to his or her project and major claims, to the constructive arguments supporting those claims, and to the various local skirmishes that arise from particular critics. Even so, common themes emerge and this author's (perhaps idiosyncratic) commitments become clear as the dust settles. 

My goal is not in the end to uncover any fresh moral truths nor even to freshly demonstrate age-old platitudes. My strategy is essential conservative: to dismantle common prejudicial objections to the assumptions undergirding (a)-(c) and rendering it plausible to believe (a)-(c) if each objection can be either undercut or rebutted. 

The defense of these claims, therefore, takes the form of an exploration of virtue, practical reason, and happiness.  Though of course details are needed, I think it best to offer a very rough initial account of three key terms: *Virtues* are positive character qualities that are admirable, necessary for living well; *practical reason* is that rational faculty of reflective and intentional deliberation by which we construct and execute life plans; and *happiness* is quite simply a name for a person (or group) whose life is going well, who has good character and has a good life plan and is executing it more or less according to plan. 

The concepts of virtue, practical reason, and happiness are the primary focus of this research. But my focus will extend to include other key concepts that these philosophers invoke in their account of virtue. For instance, *practice* is a key secondary concept in MacIntyre because he defines virtues as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to *practices*.”[@macintyre1984after, 191, emphasis added. *After Virtue* was published in 1981. Unless otherwise noted, the citations in this proposal refer to the 1984 second edition.]  To discuss MacIntyre's account of virtue it will be useful to discuss writings like that of Michael Thompson, who gives an account of life, action, and practice.[@thompson2008life] Another key secondary concept is that of a *human lifeform*, because Philippa Foot argues that virtues are necessary for creatures like us. She says, “virtues play a necessary part in the life of human beings as do stings in the life of bees.”[@foot2001natural 35] To discuss her account of virtue it will be useful to discuss concept of what is “necessary for humans” in the writings like that of Peter Geach. Similarly, the concept of *human nature* is key for Hursthouse, as is *second nature* for McDowell. 

For each writer, I shall remaining sensitive to their particular project, while keeping an eye on some or all of these thematic questions.  My primary governing questions are: how does each philosopher conceive of virtue? How does he or she defend that conception against the battery of objections from critics? And what can we cull from their accounts that is of value?

            <Text>Robert Adams I: Being For the Infinite Good
Before summarizing the debate between Boyd and Adams, we should say a few words about Robert Adams’ project. At an opposite metaethical extreme from Boyd, Adams represents supernaturalism. Adams’ fascinating Finite and Infinite Goods: A Framework for Ethics is a comprehensive case for, and explanation of, an ethical framework organized around an infinite good (God) who grounds a great variety of finite goods. 

Importantly, as we shall see below, Adams places a high premium on what he calls being for the Good. “Being for” something is a general orientation towards it, love for it, allegiance to it, and so on. Being for the good with love and allegiance is critical for Adams and for my comments about Boyd’s critiques. Why is it so critical for Adams? One reason is that one cannot love all finite goods, yet he sees (and I think rightly) that this inability is not a fault. But one can love the infinite good — be devoted to it. One can be for the Good without loving an unlimited set of finite goods. In fact, one can express ones orientation toward the infinite good by way of loving limited sets of finite goods.

A second reason being for is so important for Adams’ account is that we can and ought to love many different kinds of goods: people of various kinds, beauties of art and nature, abstract truths of mathematics and philosophy, and so on. Being for the good (in general) makes sense of our generic aspirations for excellence of many kinds,  and our admiration for those who are able to successful love and exemplify such a variety of excellences, both personal and impersonal. Even when our aspirations are unsuccessful, even in the case of ill consequences of our pursuit of excellence, there is something praiseworthy about the fundamental orientation toward the good.</Text>

            <Text>## Philosophical Ethics ##

### How do we live well? ###

How do we live well? This is the first question of life that human beings, upon arriving at the age of reflection, ask. It is also the first question of ethical philosophers. And there are various answers. 

Anyone who has long engaged in dialectical disputes over the various answer to the normative question of how to live well eventually comes to ask a secondary question: Are there any ‘right answers’ in ethics? Is there anything to all this discussion besides gas? Some worry that ethics has no ‘right answers’ because it is all just intuition-pumping. Some people view ethics as too easy because it is only a discussion of one’s opinion. 

We must admit that normative ethical conclusions — whatever conclusions satisfy us at the end of a long philosophical discussion about what is good and right — are different from conclusions in paleontology, medicine, or calculus. What does the difference amount to? Why is ethics *as a discipline* so different from, say, natural sciences? 

There are two sorts of interpretations of ethics as a discipline in light of the diversity of answers to the question about how to live well. The first is Hume’s answer, that ethics is “easy” (while metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophical anthropology are presumably difficult). 

The second is Aristotle’s, that ethics is *a different sort of science* because it has a *different subject matter* to which it must correspond. He says, “For a well schooled man is wanting searches for that degree of precision in each kind of study which the nature of the subject at hand admits: is obviously just as foolish to accept arguments of probability from a mathematician has to demand strict demonstrations from an orator.” [@aristotle Book I.3]

By the traditional classification, ethics is a form of philosophy. Russ Shafer-Landau persuasively argues this simple equation in defense of moral realism[@shafer2007ethics] but the point has broader import. If ethics is *not* a species of philosophy, it is something else entirely. Perhaps it is a species of politics. Such a categorization assumes, at the outset, that power prevails over truth. But to concede that there are no right answers in ethics, that ethical philosophers have no hope of finding any ethical truth is to give up on ethics as a discipline. 

So suppose ethics is a species of philosophy. The indirect answer is another question: Are there ‘right answers’ in philosophy? Isn’t the relation of philosophy in general to ethics in particular the relation of genus to species? This is the relation Russ Shafer-Landau argues for.[@shafer2012ethics] So the fate of ethical claims or ethical theories hangs on the fate of philosophical claims and theories as a whole. If we are philosophical optimists at all — if we are not total skeptics or nihilists — then we can be ethical optimists. 

So what species of philosophy is ethics? If philosophy is its genus, what is its differentia? Ethics is the discipline of practical reason. There are ‘right answers’ in ethics since there are right ways to live one’s life, there are wells to live well and ways to live poorly; things can go well or badly for us. One of the fundamental governing assumptions of this work is that there is no special domain of the moral. Value theory is a whole package. There is at bottom no intelligible distinction between morality and prudence. 

The word “ethical” is sometimes taken to have a broader connotation than the narrow “moral,” but I think such distinctions etymologically suspect. As MacIntyre summarizes: “‘moral’ is the etymological descendant of ‘moralis’. But ‘moralis’, like its Greek predecessor ethikos — I invented ‘moralis’ to translate the Greek word in the De Fato — means ‘pertaining to character’ where a man’s character is nothing other than his set dispositions to behave systematically in one way rather than another, to lead on particular kind of life.”[@macintyre1984after 38] The early uses of Moral did not contrast with “‘prudential’ or ‘self interested’” nor with “‘legal or ‘religious’”. MacIntyre concludes: “The word to which it is closest in meaning is perhaps most simply ‘practical’.”

Practicality as a whole domain was sub-divided. The conventional distinction that “morality” is a special sub-division pertaining to right and wrong behavior toward others traces to the 1700s, where “immorality” meant sexual misbehavior.  The conventional separation of “moral” from “non-moral” considerations traces to John Stuart Mill who divided the former domain as concerned with duties to benefit and to not harm others. 

As one MacIntyre scholar puts it: ‘The term practical rationality is derived from Aristotle’s *phronesis*. It is to be distinguished from *sophia*, a more technical form of reasoning. Practical rationality leads to more approximate conclusions; it takes context and relative facts into account, and it usually leads to moral or political conclusions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 60-61] If we take philosophical ethics to be reflection on morality as a whole then, on this view, philosophical ethics is reflection on practical rationality. Practical rationality is simply the process of deciding what to do. It is the process of thinking through what to do. Or, in Gibbard’s unforgettable phrasing, it is “thinking how to live”.[@gibbard2009thinking] 

Rosalind Hursthouse likewise says that: “The concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its possessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or admirable person who acts and feels well, rightly, as she should. These are commonly accepted truisms.”[@sepvirtue] These truisms encompass our everyday moral judgments about who is admirable much more broadly than our judgments about who is morally upstanding or who avoids being morally despicable. There is more to being an admirable person than *avoiding* transgressions. Nicholas Gier’s memorable image of the “couch potato” illustrates this point. The Couch Potato works a mindless job  which he is able adequately to perform while watching television (and today we can add, checking his Facebook and Twitter feeds); he rarely rises except to receive himself and microwave his dinners; he is even religious, watching his favorite preachers on Sunday morning television and tithing regularly. Yet the couch potato is by my standards living a wasted life and pitiable life. (I am counting on your similar intuition.) We do not want to imprison him for being such a failure; but we certainly do not admire how he lives. 

By contrast, admirable people command our respect for being morally upstanding, and so much more. We admire them for their brains, their guts, their strength, their rare talents, their outstanding achievements, their unimaginable creativity, their wit and eloquence. Some people are remarkable for *what they are given* (great beauty, great intelligence, and so on). But the admirable person is remarkable not just for good fortune. In fact, admirable people are often admirable for overcoming extraordinarily bad fortune. We truly admire *what they do* with *what they are given*. In a word, we admire how they live. 

How did this broad sense of morality as living life excellently narrow? 

### How did the meaning of ‘morality’ narrow? 

First, it meant any particular way of life — something like idiosyncrasy, habit, character. Second, any practical lesson — something like the “moral of the story”, the point, that to be acted on, the rule, the maxim. Third, a domain of rules of conduct that are “neither theological nor legal nor aesthetic”[@macintyre1984 39]

### Three Dimensions of Practical Reason

Now, the domain of duties and obligations pertaining to others is a real domain and a legitimate division. But the division is not between morality and non-morality but between different types of morality or sub-domains. I shall call this domain “2nd-personal morality”, that is, my duties to you or to you all. This domain is vast. But there are other domains for the 1st-person and 3rd-person. 

The entire set is the domain of practicality — what one ought to do or ought to think, say, etc. The three sub-domains are defined by the object with regard to which one ought to do and not do this or that. 

The domain of 1st-person morality is proper respect and care for one’s self — self-love or enlightened self-interest. This is what Mill called the domain of “prudence”. It includes the virtues that benefit both oneself and others (moderation and courage) but especially practical wisdom, without which none of the other virtues do me much good. 

The domain of 3rd-person morality is proper respect and care for everything that is not you or me — animals and plants, pets and work animals, our possessions, our earth and environment, and perhaps even our solar system. The primary virtue of this domain is justice, a respect for the whole and the proper arrangement of all the parts. If God exists, then 3rd-personal morality would require piety to him or her, since on most theisms God is not strictly speaking “one of us” but still demands our allegiance, sacrifice, or what have you. 

The domain of 2nd-person morality, I said, is vast. It includes interpersonal moral obligations, values, and virtues as well as broader social or political ones. I suggest that the dominant virtue here is not only justice but love — I.e., a strong regard for the other, a charitable orientation to promoting the good of others, refusing to harm them, and committing to protect them from harm. 

### Defense? ###

I believe this fundamental assumption of mine is defensible. But it is not defensible a part from the details of the metaethical virtue theory I am trying to work out in the remainder of the book. That is, the critic who arrives at the conclusion of the book and objects to that conclusion may either object to one or more particular chapter or particular claim, or else she may object that such governing assumptions themselves have lead us astray. 

The only response I will offer now is not a defense, strictly speaking. It is a strategic rhetorical reversal of the burden of proof. The response is this: why do we moderns *assume* that there is a special domain of the moral? The ancient and medieval philosophers in the west thought of the domain of practical reason as a natural unit: all that is voluntary or under our control may be done well or badly. Our goal in living well is to to identify what to think, what to do, and what to make. As a corollary, we must identify what not to think, what not to do, and what not to make. But shrinking the whole domain of practical reason down to the domain of a few absolute prohibitions on harming others is a modern innovation. If it is right, then it is a modern invention. If it is wrong, it is a modern ignorance. Either way, its proponent needs, I think, to offer some account of why such a shrinking amounts to progress rather than regress in moral theorizing.

            <Text>Return of the Virtues
Virtue talk is astonishingly enduring. It is almost old as human history yet as cutting edge as any philosophical fad. 
Virtue talk lost purchase during the heady days of the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment, especially in western Europe and North America. Yet in the last 60 years in analytic philosophy, virtue ethics has achieved a kind of ascendancy. According to the Chalmers survey, 18% (almost a fifth) of analytic philosophers are virtue ethicists, with only 25% and 23% avowing deontology or consequentialism respectively. (The rest were “other.”)
Even so, the contemporary virtue ethicist who thinks virtue talk is indispensable has challengers on every front. Within virtue ethical conversations, what exact doctrines "virtue ethics" is supposed to entail is far from clear. Then there are normative ethical challenges from deontologists, utilitarians, relativists, and moral skeptics. Most broadly, the foundations of virtue ethics are still largely unexplored. There are metaethical challenges from anti-realists, constructivists, non-cognitivists.

Ethics and Metaethics: Virtue and Foundation of Virtue
According to some philosophers, (second-order) metaethical theories like cognitivism and non-cognitivism are neutral with respect to (first-order) normative theories like consequentialism or virtue ethics.  And yet, one's conclusions about metaethical foundations do bear natural relations to specific ethical theories. Moore's Principia, a metaethical source text, is consequentialist, and many naturalist realists (like Boyd and Railton) and even non-cognitivists (like Mackie) are consequentialists. Non-naturalists tend to be realists (like Shaffer-Lanau) and divine command theorists (like Robert Adams) or deontologists (like Kant, who is a non-naturalist with respect to ethics if not metaphysics). No one to my knowledge has attempted to wed non-cognitivism with virtue talk. 
An adequate philosophical ethics cannot divorce ethical and metaethical concerns for long (Darwall 2006). The very notion of divorcing ethical questions about what is good from metaethical questions about what the term ‘good’ means is a modern notion, dating to G. E. Moore’s (1903) proud proclamation (and I paraphrase) that every ethicist before him had failed clearly to define terms. But virtue ethicists pre-existed the modern metaethical conversation and will not accommodate its demand to keep formal and material ethical questions separate. 
	So how might the core commitments of virtue ethics affect one's conclusion about metaethical foundations? The virtue ethicist is committed, minimally, to virtue talk, to the conceptual definition of virtue as somehow beneficial (Hursthouse). Also, she is committed to notions of practical wisdom (Annas). Although some are not eudaimonists (Stephen Brown), traditional virtue ethics is committed to the notion that happiness is the telos of human life or at least that human life has a telos (MacIntyre). 
For philosophical ethics, a criterion is that an ethical theory exemplify both theoretical and practical virtues. A good theory must be both abstract and pragmatic. It is a tall order to demand that a theory match our overall world-picture and be adequate to explain a wide range of phenomena in our ethical lives — but even that is not enough. The theory must also be useful to us, help us in dilemmas, be a map by which we navigate difficult transitions. And an ethical theory that appeals to virtues and vices can do just that. 

To that end, my plan is to examine six virtue ethicists to build an adequate virtue theory that also pays due attention to abstract metaethical challenges, questions, and objections about realism and idealism, naturalism and theism. It would be impossible or perhaps foolhardy for me to attempt a full treatment. Instead, I work toward this end by examining six influential virtue ethicists to discover their positions (if any) on these metaethical debates, and the strengths and weaknesses of their metaethical positions. Those six virtue ethicists are: Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, John McDowell, Stephen Brown, and Robert Adams.  These six writers are exemplars whom I take to be representative of particular tradition or sub-sets of a particular tradition. That tradition is rooted explicitly in Aristotle and the medieval Aristotelians (like Aquinas) but critiques, extends, and otherwise modifies the orthodox Aristotelian doctrine (especially that laid out in the Nicomachean Ethics).

Brief Outline
In the first section, I shall briefly review the virtue theory of Aristotle and the historical ascendancy of the Aristotelian virtue tradition in the English-speaking philosophy (via Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, and others). I situate virtue ethics within modern moral philosophy alongside deontology, consequentialism, and divine command theory. I also situate neo-Aristotelian naturalism within metaethical context of other moral naturalisms. 
	In the second section, I give a chapter to my six writers. For each writer, we shall ask a set of core normative ethical questions. By asking the same questions of each writer we will build a clear picture of where this tradition has come from. By examining each writer in turn, clarifying their view, critiquing, and (hopefully) correcting it, I may hope to extend that tradition, building an account of my own. 
	In the third section,  I present my own contribution. I synthesize what I take to be what is correct in each of these thinkers and reject what I take to be faulty or implausible, building (or beginning) an account that constitutes a metaethical foundation of virtue.  This synthesis shows that seemingly disparate notions actually gather themselves into two coherent and competing accounts. Both of which are non-reductive, morally realist accounts, but differ especially with respect to the metaphysical status of nature, God, and human nature. Finally, I articulate the theoretical costs and benefits of each in light of the broader debate between theism and metaphysical naturalism.</Text>

For instance, I reject part of his notion that virtues are relative to changing traditions rather than a stable human nature. And I endorse the thesis that human practice is teleological and hence that non-teleological ethics are either false or (in the end) *actually* covertly teleological, but defer the question of the relationship between *social* teleology and *physical*,  biological, natural, or metaphysical teleology.

            <Text>
Richard Boyd I:  Homeostatic Property Clusters
In this section, I shall examine a written conversation between Boyd and Adams spanning one book and three articles. I offer my own contribution to their conversation. 
 
Richard Boyd’s metaethical project began in force with the influential “How to Be a Moral Realist” (1998). He established the strong plausibility of one kind of ethical naturalism. Boyd is not a non-cognitivist or “otherwise deflationary” naturalist. He is interested (along with Sturgeon, Brink, Miller, et. al.,) in justifying moral realism within the bounds of a strict, scientific naturalism. Their project has at least two claims, one epistemological and the other ethical. The first (epistemological) claim is that ethics is a science (or should be!); ethical inquiry can and should be continuous with empirical scientific inquiries. The second (ethical) claim is that ethics is somehow consequentialist; Boyd and others think ethical inquiry will involve giving some kind of naturalistic account of our collective human welfare and of those natural properties that contribute thereto. 

Most of Boyd’s writings have focused on the formal schema rather than the content of a naturalistic moral realism, offering a general framework rather than detailed and comprehensive moral realist accounts, including a list of goods. Even so, in sketching out the schema, he has offered an account of “important human goods”, both physical and psychological, like food and friendship. Exactly what natural entities and properties count as human goods will become important below. 

Natural Kinds
For Boyd, goods are importantly like natural kinds. Normal natural kinds, like ‘water’ and ‘metal’ indispensably feature in our inductive and abductive reasoning.[^2] For example, suppose that I begin typing on a friend’s laptop on a cold day, but I notice the keys are surprisingly cold to the touch. My friend points out that his keyboard keys are not plastic but metal. “Metal” of course, is not one single element on the periodic table, and so has no one single essence, understood as a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for instantiation. So what is such a natural kind? Certain properties tend to cluster together (conductivity, malleability, etc.), where the presence of each of which makes likely the presence of the others. This understanding of natural kinds is flexible enough to show why ‘metal’ can feature in a good explanation (of why the keyboard is cold) and also why exceptional or unusual metals —- ones that lack some typical properties — still count as members of the natural kind.

Biological natural kinds follow the same pattern. Tigers are real, and ‘tiger’ the natural kind is real. We do not invent, but discover, the nature of tigers.  Yet ‘Tiger’ is not one property-instantiation of a simple universal, but denotes a cluster of properties that tend to make likely others in that cluster.

Goodness, Boyd suggests, is just such a natural kind and homeostatic property cluster. Something similar to our application of terms like ‘metal’ and ‘tiger’ is going on in our application of value terms and the semantic relation to real — but natural —  value-properties. Our value talk  is answerable to something in the mind-independent real world: such property clusters. Property clusters like goodness, however, have no one analytic definition — at base, they are not unities but pluralities. Keeping goodness as a natural kind without supplying an analytic definition helpfully avoids the definist fallacy.[^3] Beyond this schema, Boyd thinks that the properties that make up the goodness cluster tend to come together in certain political and social contexts (like democratic, respectful, egalitarian, courteous, educated societies) where we pursue and somewhat successfully achieve human welfare.[^4] So virtues, right actions, laws or policies and so on earn the predicate “good” when they “tend to foster the realization of these goods” (Boyd 1988, 203). As Adams says (in summarizing Boyd) “The good is more fundamental than the right in his view, and well-being or what is good for people is more fundamental than moral goodness” (Adams 2003, 60).

Transgenerational Scientific Disciplines
The correct account of ethical terms as natural kind terms will also include considerations of the inquiry as a whole, the disciplinary matrix. The disciplinary matrix is an interweaving set of terms and projects shared by practitioners and researchers within a discipline. The terms ‘metal,’ ‘tiger ’and‘ goodness’ are currency in chemistry, biology, and ethics respectively. Our account of them should make sense of how experts in that discipline intelligibly converse, form predictions, and achieve successes in that field. It should make sense of how that field or discipline exists across generations.

Boyd’s ambitious project, we can see, is both naturalist and realist. He invokes concepts like natural kinds and disciplinary matrices from his metaphysics and epistemology of scientific realism to build a similar explanation of moral natural kinds and moral inquiry. Unlike “deflationary” naturalists like Mackie, Boyd does not take the (shorter, but more problematic) path of denying that goodness is a real thing.

Scientific explanation
 	“What, asks Boyd, is to play the role in ethics that observation plays in science? And the answer, he announces, is simply observation. He favours a substantive ethical view he labels “homeostatic consequentialism” which identifies goodness with a cluster of properties, conducive to the satisfaction of human needs, tending to occur together and with a tendency to promote each other (or to be promoted by the same sorts of things). If this theory is right, goodness is a natural property and as amenable to observation as any other.”Footnote %   

Boyd thinks that values, to be respectable naturalist entities, must feature in scientific explanations, like other facts. Much of the the promise of this theory is that moral facts can can feature in explanations, as when I explain the death of millions of people in Germany by Hitler’s “depravity.” Much of the objections to this theory center around whether moral facts are the right kind of explanation, or function in the right kind of way, as other non-moral facts. 

Boyd also admits that “naturalist moral realists have also advocated some version or other of consequentialism as the substantive naturalist moral theory to which they are committed. Indeed, although nothing like entailment between these positions obtains, the idea that moral questions are questions about how we can help each other flourish seems central to contemporary naturalist moral realism. In a certain sense, some version of consequentialism seems to be the natural position for naturalist moral realists.” 

&gt;Stephen Darwall (2006: 25) notes that, nevertheless, “there do seem to be affinities between metaethical and roughly corresponding ethical theories,” for example, metaethical naturalists have almost universally tended to be Utilitarians at the first-order level, though not vice versa. Notable exceptions to this tendency—that is, metaethical naturalists who are also first-order deontologists—include Alan Gewirth (1977) and Michael Boylan (1999; 2004). For critical responses to these positions, see Beyleveld (1992), Steigleder (1999), Spence (2006), and Gordon (2009). (Kevin DeLapp, "Metaethics")[@delapp]

&gt;Matthew Kramer (2009: 2) has argued that metaethical realism (see section four below) is itself actually a first-order moral view as well, noting that “most of the reasons for insisting on the objectivity of ethics are ethical reasons.” (For a similar view about the first-order “need” to believe in the second-order thesis that moral values are “objective,” see also Ronald Dworkin 1996.) Torbjörn Tännsjö (1990), by contrast, argues that, although metaethics is irrelevant to normative theorizing, it may still be significant in other psychological or pragmatic way, for example, by constraining other beliefs. Nicholas Sturgeon (1986) has claimed that the first-order belief in moral fallibility must be grounded in some second-order metaethical view. And David Wiggins (1976) has suggested that metaethical questions about the ultimate foundation and justification of basic moral beliefs may have deep existential implications for how humans view the question of the meaning of life. [@delapp]

 
Adams II: The “Critical Stance” Tells against Naturalism
Adams second chapter of Finite and Infinite Goods takes aim at naturalism. Naturalisms, of which there are many, are united in seeing the good as immanent to either the physical, natural world or at least to human nature — our thoughts, motivations, physiology, psychology, and so on. The transcendence Adams argues for includes (at least) three points: The Good itself surpasses every (finite) good thing. Since the Good is limitless, it explains the (in principle unlimited) potential for new instances and kinds of human and non-human goodness and beauty. Finally, and most importantly for our purposes, the Good being limitless explains why we ought to maintain a critical stance Adams argues is indispensable to our ethical thinking. The “critical stance” is the key theme I want to trace in this paper.

In Chapter 2, section 4, Adams takes aim at (especially) Richard Boyd’s naturalism. The main critique is that (Boyd’s sort) of naturalism allegedly excludes a “critical stance” that is necessary for any ethical theory. Just what is the “critical stance”? Adams’ own summary is this: “For any natural, empirically identifiable property or type of action that we or others may regard as good or bad, right or wrong, we are committed to leave it always open in principle to raise evaluative or normative questions by asking whether that property or action‐type is really good or right, or to issue an evaluative or normative challenge by denying that it is really good or right” (Adams 2002, 78).  Our ethical thinking and practical judgments must be “open” when we judge finite goods to be good. The reason is not (pace G. E. Moore) that we can simply assume the good to be indefinable and then dismiss attempted definitions. Rather, because there is a metaphysical gap between the transcendent, infinite good and any finite thing, our certainty that there is a good is always counterpoised with our uncertainty that this is as good as it seems to us at present. This critical stance is, according to Adams, definitionally a part of our value talk.  He says, “I think the critical stance is part of the general intentional framework in which we use evaluative and normative terms, at least where morality and excellence are concerned, and thus affects the semantically indicated role of such terms.” (Adams 2002, 78) To fail to account for it would be a grave error.

What is wrong with Boyd’s view, according to Adams? Boyd thinks that empirical knowledge — albeit hypothetical, future knowledge — could be enough to settle a question of value. Adams thinks that the “settling” of the question would always and in principle be hasty. Of course, Boyd can accommodate the proper open, critical stance right now, but cannot guarantee that it is the right stance to take in some hypothetical future when our empirical data is perfectly full and adequate.

One final corollary of Adams’ critical stance thesis that Boyd also discusses is that some of our moral beliefs are already (prior to idealized empirical justification) more epistemically secure than some well-grounded scientific theories. Putting the matter a little more sharply, Adams says, “...it would surely be crazier to give up the belief that it would be wicked to torture children than to say that there must be something wrong with quantum mechanics” (Adams 76). Boyd’s naturalist realism seems to entail that even beliefs like the (almost certain) proposition ‘it is wicked to torture children’ are as open to revision as the latest beliefs about sub-atomic particles. Despite Boyd’s attempt to secure such beliefs under the umbrella of ‘quasi-analycity, that openness, Adams thinks, is far too open.

Somewhat more succinctly and less clearly than Adams puts it, we might say that if a  metaethical theory is true, it must include (in the sense of either justifying or at least not contradicting) a critical stance toward ethical judgments and ethical questions. Boyd’s ethical theory — his sort of consequentialist naturalism — does not include such a critical stance. So Boyd’s ethical theory is false.
 
Boyd II: Partial Denotation &amp; Epistemic Normativity
Boyd’s response to Adams is, largely, to consent that the “critical stance” is critically important (Boyd 2003, 508). So he must show how his naturalism can accommodate it. Where necessary, where naturalism cannot accommodate the “criticalness,” Boyd must show how it is not important. Of course, Boyd clarifies, not every stance that qualifies as ‘critical’ is desirable. Boyd sketches the “critical-stance-on-the-cheap”, in which any conclusion “not analytically entailed by empirical evidence” is falls short of deductive certainty (2003, 524). Empirical evidence just doesn’t underwrite conclusions that certainly.

Of the more substantive openness or criticalness, Boyd thinks it “epistemically correct” to take “something like the critical stance [Adams] articulates” (2003, 513). We are to be open to new insight, new conversation, new challenges to our ethical conclusions because (a) they depend on empirical observations and empirically-based arguments, and (b) such observations and arguments are “complex” and it is difficult to say when they are “definitive” (2003, 513). Consenting to this much, Boyd thinks it is false that the critical stance is “part of our current conception of ethical reasoning” (2003, 514). So how much and what kind of “openness” to reevaluation does Boyd endorse?

Boyd’s overall project is to present epistemic, metaphysical, and semantic considerations that defend or increase the plausibility of naturalist moral realism. It would be impossible to summarize his lengthy article entirely. In this section, I shall attempt to organize Boyd’s instructive responses under two headings: Partial denotation of ethical terms and epistemic normativity. I shall then summarize more briefly Adams’ responses to Boyd before giving my own.
 
Partial Denotation, Externalism, and Quasi-Analycity
The first consideration Boyd discusses throughout is “partial denotation.” This semantic notion does metaphysical and ethical work. Denotation occurs when language users mean to denote k with term t. Partial denotation is the notion that language users mean to and successfully do denote k1 with term t, but at the same time (erroneously and unintentionally) also denote another kind (k2).  For example, the term ‘species’ partially denotes (and properly so) the concept of a family of, say, animals, or trees, or systems; it also (improperly) implies that species is the same in animal species and a floral species, qua species. Terms partially denote when they bear “a strong reference-like connection” to a kind but the reference-connection is not clean or complete. One way to approach this notion is to think about a natural kind term that has referred to the same natural kind entity for centuries.  How did language users successfully use the term ‘water’ (or ‘lead’) denote H2O (or atomic number 82) before we had the chemical knowledge that water is (atomically) H20 or the chemical makeup of Pb? Boyd’s answer is partial denotation.

This is where “partial denotation” comes in to help keep a place for the critical stance. Partial denotation allows us to give credit to early language users and explain their successful application of terms to the relevant properties while also denying them full knowledge of the referents of those terms, and endorsing our own more advanced knowledge. As Adams phrases it, “If ‘good’ does... indeed signify a real property, there must be a tendency for members of the relevant community of discourse to be approximately right in (much of) what they say about the good, though this tendency may, and almost certainly does, fall hugely short of infallibility” (Adams 2003, 128). Notice that both philosophers are obliged to account for our successes and failures as ethical thinkers, but their emphases are different. Adams can explain why we already grasp the good enough to be for it, but must tell a story about how can err; Boyd can easily explain how we err, but must tell a longer story to explain how we often get the reference of moral terms right.

Another way partial denotation helps Boyd is to develop a plausible externalism. Internalism is the conception that something being good is sufficient reason for preferring it. The good is the admirable, desirable, worthy, etc. by definition. (Needless to say, it may or may not be admired, desired, or ascribed worth — but it is so.) Boyd admits that “it is hard to defend internalism and naturalism simultaneously” (2003, 532). As I understand it, Boyd’s solution is to offer that some terms that definitionally include ‘worthiness of pursuit’ do indeed partially denote things or actions that are worthy of pursuit, but not completely.

How exactly partial denotation works in each case is much less clear. He says that “if we are faced with evidence which seems to establish that the term ‘good’ refers to some natural phenomenon, P, the moral implausibility of P’s being the good can in principle undermine or override such evidence. Moral inquiry has a certain level of autonomy with respect to other areas of inquiry. If one thinks of this autonomy as absolute, then the appeal to partial denotation might be one way to save some sort of moral realism without adopting Adams’ solution” (2003, 531). Yet Boyd denies that moral inquiry is (completely) autonomous. He sees ethical reasoning as “continuous” with other natural and social sciences, both methodologically and ontologically. Each branch of science has a certain level of autonomy, but none complete. So deliverances from its autonomous domain cannot coherently serve as principles that trump the empirical discoveries of any other domain.

As a particular example, Boyd notes that many approbative terms like “just,” “fair” and so on tend to be used in contexts where the referents are convenient to the ruling class. The morally implausible conclusion that the ‘good’ both refers to ‘the convenience of the ruling class’ and that such convenience is in fact good is urged upon us by examining the “reference-like relations” between the use of the term historically and the oftentimes referent. We can be mistaken because the convenience the ruling class is not quite what goodness really is. “We (let’s hope rightly) take ourselves to be informed moral practitioners, and we rely-with serious qualifications-on our own moral judgments as evidential with respect both to the extension of “good,” and the aims of moral practice.” (2003, 545)

To take another particular case of moral implausibility, Boyd discusses the proposition that torturing children is wicked. Boyd (borrowing from Putnam) defines some propositions as ‘quasi-analytic’ — meaning that “even when we know that their justification is a posteriori rather than a priori, we find it extremely difficult to envision circumstances under which they would be disconfirmed” due their “conceptual and methodological centrality.” Changing them requires not simple empirical observations but “pretty serious conceptual and theoretical ‘revolutions’.” He offers two examples of quasi-analytic statements: torturing children is wicked and “the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics” (which he does not further specify).  To empirically confirm that torturing children is wicked, the term ‘wickedness’ picks out a natural property or family of properties “related to human goods and harms” etc., and that our judgments “track this family of properties” (2003, 525). Even though the proposition is ‘quasi-analytic’, the naturalist must remain open in principle to the possibility that empirical investigation could reveal the proposition to be false (in some cases, at some times, etc.). In this way, Boyd hopes to retain room for a kind of critical stance.

 
 Epistemic (Morally-Neutral) Norms
A second key component of Boyd’s case is the primacy of epistemic norms. Can the study itself of ethical terms and properties be value neutral? Boyd imagines an intelligent, amoral, non-human linguist who wants to study the semantics of human languages, but who does not itself have any moral commitments (533). Boyd admits that his scientific realism (the analog to which he is trying to compare or with which he is trying to equate moral realism) is not value neutral; but he says it is moral-value neutral. The only norms (or “values” if you like) in force are epistemic norms governing, presumably those governing valid inferences, likely hypotheses, and so on. For instance, Boyd says that “in deciding what the referent is of a natural kind term, we are seeking to identify... the one which best fits the explanatory role associated with natural kind terms” (2003, 535, author’s emphasis). The notion of a “best fit” is, of course, normative — but epistemically so only. The only normative judgments “involved in determining that the nature of water is H2O ... are purely epistemic judgments about the merits of competing explanations...” (Boyd 2003, 536). Also, strangely, Boyd thinks these norms are hypothetical. He gives a rough example in imperative form: “Classify this way if you want to discover true generalizations about how chemical reactions work” (2003, 536).

Boyd extends his account of these epistemic hypothetical norms that govern practitioners in various disciplines in order to show how an amoral extraterrestrial still might be able to identify the reference of the moral terms of “moral practitioners” over time, accounting for old errors and new improvements (544). He hopes that these reflections show that one need only endorse epistemic norms to “explore the nature of the (moral) good” (2003, 545). In these ways, Boyd tries to bolster his naturalistic account and make room for (one kind of) critical stance.

One final question demands some comment. For Boyd, some of these ethical questions are metaphysically neutral. Ultimately, he believes the kind of openness that is epistemically or morally required depends in some part on one’s prior metaphysical views. Boyd thinks “that in fact neither naturalistic moral realism nor theistic moral realism has any difficulty in accounting for this sort of critical stance” (2003, 526). 

Rather, our approach to the question depends on each philosopher's prior metaphysical reasoning in general, (largely) independent of the conversation about the metaphysics of morals in particular. 

For instance, Adams sees our uncertainty about particular ethical judgments (that X is good, admirable, etc.) as rooted in God’s infinite nature. The unbounded nature of the good makes the a priori delimiting of goods impossible. That account both Boyd and Adam agree *could* be the right one, that it has some plausibility, that it is at least the right kind of account. 

On the other hand, Boyd can build something just as plausible: human nature is such that “uncertainty of knowledge of complex psychological, social, political, and economic factors” make a priori delimiting likewise impossible. “It is a matter of how we, as knowing subjects, are situated in a complex web of physical, psychological, and social causes” (2003, 529). 

But these metaphysical questions Boyd punts to another discussion. He says, “I believe, we should do the relevant metaphysics. If you have (largely) independent reasons to accept theism... then you have reason to accept the deeper metaphysical explanation and justification of for moral doubt” (2003, 530). While keeping two difficult inquiries separate is important for clarity, there is a danger to this strategy, as I shall comment below.


Adams III: On Epistemic Norms
Adams’ paper is a warmly approving and thorough response to Boyd’s “Finite Goods.” They agree on many points. Where they disagree, again, is on the question of a critical stance, on the moral neutrality of epistemic norms, and on the internalism (of identification of the good and motivation).

What is his particular response to Boyd’s brand of critical stance? Adams says, “We do not endorse the same kind of openness.” (2003, 129) Boyd “seems to envisage ... refusing any longer to be committed to being for the good, while still believing that there is a real property... actually signified by ‘good.’” (2003, 130). By contrast, Adams “assumes that [goodness] gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good” (2003, 130). This is a telling critique, and I shall give my best explanation of the difference below.

Adams also differs from Boyd’s putatively ‘value-free’ epistemic norms. Boyd insists that the only normativity operative in identifying natural properties to which moral terms refer is epistemic normativity. Adams argues that “properly-attuned Eros” is response to excellence in a way that allows us to fix the reference of moral terms. Adams admits that Boyd might be able to “domesticate” such a notion into naturalistic account, but the attempt would be dubious. He would have to aver that “causal relationships [are] ultimately decisive for the nature of proper attunement of Eros” (Adams 2003, 130).  Adam’s response is to strongly recommend internalism. Adams affirms existence internalism when he says he “assume[s] that [goodness] is a property that gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good.” (Adams 2003, 130).

Boyd and Adam seem to disagree about what kinds of ethical propositions are up for grabs. Adams summarizes the problem in this way: “It is a serious problem, discussed in more than one place in Finite and Infinite Goods, how to hold firm moral convictions, on points on which one ought to have them, without failing idolatrously to acknowledge the distinction in principle between one's own convictions about the good, even on the most obvious points, and the good itself.” (Adams 2002, 128) As I see it, the dual propositions that we both know the good (irrevocably) and don’t sufficiently know the good (and so must always remain open) are in tension, but both true. The tension demands “a measure of trust, mingled no doubt with caution or distrust, in the stirrings of our own Eros” (131). We can be mistaken about the good and incorrectly apply the term, but we cannot be deeply and pervasively mistaken. The good must be something to which we have “epistemic access” and “epistemic access in the right way, partly through our Eros and other affective volitional responses” (Adams 2002, 131).

For Boyd, the attempt to settle the reference of value terms might need the kind of objective, third-person perspective of an intelligent extraterrestrial. But this leads to strange conclusions. What would an external observer guess is the reference of the term good? Quite often “the convenience for the ruling class”, something Boyd does not admire but that does satisfy or seems to satisfy the reference of the term. Boyd tries to keep ironic distance from endorsing this denotation by admitting that it might be (and is probably) only a partial denotation. For Adams even this admission is too near to a horrible falsehood. He says he would rather give up moral realism entirely than endorse the proposition that ‘the good’ means ‘the convenience of the ruling class.’

 
Responses
Some of my responses I have already hinted at above. In this section I try to spell out with a little more detail some key points in this debate.  I organize my comments under a few three headings: openness, “third personal” morality, virtue epistemology.
 
Openness
I began this inquiry with a quotation from Plato because it captures a tension that we shall see is crucial for understanding the debate between Adams and Boyd. For Plato, two seeming paradoxes are thematic, and recur (I think) throughout these writings. The first is that the good is mysterious even to specialists (“dialecticians”) and yet plain to everyone. We ‘divine’ it, but do not know it. The second is that the good is simple and unitary but underlies and causes a bewildering plurality of kinds of goods.

The first paradox is very close to the internalism/externalism debate, and heart of the Boyd/Adams conversation.  For Plato, the belief that P is good moves an agent to act — or rather, the fact that agents pursue P is due to their generic, overriding pursuit of the good. Good things intrinsically motivate pursuit, and our judgments about what is good or bad intrinsically motivates us, at least somewhat. Yet we can still err in judging the wrong thing to be good or in not pursuing the good well enough. There is a balance that Plato’s insight maintains: To emphasize too much our knowledge of the good is to risk undue rigidity and moral hubris. To emphasize too much our ignorance of the good is to risk undue flexibility and moral cowardice. Even today, any ethical theorist has to explain both how we are correct when we think about, talk about, and pursue various goods (beauty, excellence, justice) and how we are incorrect when we err. That we err often is, I hope, obvious. For we do misjudge the good, pursue the bad, whether or not we do so intentionally. That we are not therefore completely or utterly ignorant of the good seems to me equally obvious.

In my reading, one (unstated) reason that being for the good is so central to Adams’ framework is the truth in Plato’s statement above: We “divine that the good is something” (we have knowledge) but are “perplexed and cannot adequately grasp what it is.” Plato (and Socrates) see a truth that seems to me critical: we both know and do not know the good. To deny that we know it through “divination”, intuition, or some such less-than-adequate faculty is to risk betraying the good, to risk not being for the good.

Keeping these dual propositions in mind is the key to my own interpretation of Adam’s critical stance. We must hold two true propositions in view at all times. First, that we know the good, somehow and someway. Adams does not call this knowing an incorrigible intuition, but he does seem to rely on it. But secondly, and just as importantly, we do not know the good sufficiently; we don’t know it well enough to avoid error. Both propositions, and the tension between them, are essential to clear ethical outlook. To lose one would be like closing one eye.

How do these reflections relate to the so-called critical stance? It seems to the choice of the words ‘critical’ and ‘open’ are unfortunate. For, one can be “open” with regard to first principles or open with regard to conclusions derived therefrom. For example, one should be open to the possibility that one’s deductive reasoning, even when the argument seems watertight,  is erroneous in some unforeseen way; one should most emphatically not be open to the possibility that, say, the law of non-contradiction is false. Are there any principles of ethical thinking or practical reasoning that are as irreproachable and incorrigible as the law of non-contradiction is in speculative or theoretical thinking? I think Aquinas’ estimation that the proposition good is to be done and evil avoided qualify as propositions just about as fundamental and obvious as any, within an ethical context or outside (Summa Theologiae, 1-2, Q. 94, Art 2). That we know the good well enough for the proposition ‘the good is to be done’ to be intelligible seems to me a fundamental truth that Plato and many others have clung to.

Even so, as ethical inquiries (those with long histories and those active today) become more detailed, complicated, and practical, the conviction that option A or B is good becomes more difficult to justify with anything like certainty. So here remaining open and critical is the proper epistemic stance.

Boyd, I take it, would say that our success in pursuing the (real) good by name is due to a partial denotation, and the our failures in pursuing it are due to the fact that the denotation is only partial. But Adams has a stronger explanation for our confident that the good is to be pursued antecedently to any but the vaguest notion of what particular properties are conducive to human welfare. We know that excellence is desirable before we know very clearly or very thoroughly what human excellence consists of. Adams seems right that we can even recognize new and unprecedented forms of excellence when they appear to us, because we have first cognized the good.

Third Personal Morality
Now for the second paradox. The Republic quotation highlights that the good is unitary yet causes all kinds of goodness. It is maximally single yet its effects are maximally plural — there are moral goods (virtues, etc.) but also aesthetic goods and many others. The good, therefore, explains all goodness. Like other Platonic forms, the good is the ‘cause’ of all good things insofar as they are good. Equality itself is the cause of equal things being equal. Both explain all instantiations of the given property in various substances. But the range of instantiations for goodness seems wider than that of equality. One can eat good food, have a good social standing, enjoy good health, create and obey good laws, contemplate good theories. Adams appropriates this framework to explain the commonsensical notion that there are not just many excellent things but many vastly different kinds of excellence. He says, “The things that I take to be excellent —  great books, beautiful music, heroic deeds, the dynamic complexity of a living body or an ecosystem — are very diverse, and so are the ways in which they are excellent. I take beauty, moral virtue, and the aptness of a response or interpretation all to be types of excellence” (Adams 2003, 119). Since God is the good, and finite goods are good by resemblance, Adams can account for the dappled and diverse range of incommensurable kinds of goodness.

For the ethical naturalist, a long and difficult account is required to unify all of the things to which we predicate a set of somewhat unified value predicates. If the good is a natural property cluster, Boyd may be quite some distance toward giving an account of just what property clusters are good for us, but he is quite a distance away from giving an account of systems (say, the excellence of an ecosystem) in which humans do not play a major part or any part at all, or of a piece of natural beauty (say, a billion-light-years distant nebula) that has never been and perhaps will never be viewed by human eyes. Intuitively, an ecosystem can be working well, a many-colored nebula can be lovely or admirable even if no (human) appraises it as such. On this front, I think the ethical framework Adams provides is more plausible, other things being equal, than Boyd’s.

Traditionally, ethical thinking and practice have included principles and maxims related not only to the treatment of others and the cultivation of virtue but also attention towards one’s final end. This comprehensive moral view included what we might call first-personal, second-personal, and third-personal dimensions. That is, one important ethical question is who ought I to become? What is psychological order? A second is how ought I to treat you? And you me? A third is What is the proper purpose of human life? Where are we headed?  For example, Aristotle writes about eudaimonia as participating in the life of god (3rd-person), about justice (2nd-person) and about moderation (1st-person).   Boyd, predictably, makes the same narrow move that many modern thinkers do — that of reducing all ethical thinking and practice down to “care for others”. When he talks about the particular contents of a normative ethics (to fill out the details of his metaethical framework) he seems to be thinking only of second-personal morality. When he summarizes the “problems we face in trying to care for each other” as largely “features of social, economic and political structures” (531). He does not think much about human welfare as a species of excellence (say, enjoying excellence as Adams has it), where individual, social, aesthetic, personal goods and so on all participate in the same kind of goodness. The point of these reflections is that the more values we include in our search for a cogent, unified account, the less plausible becomes the notion of homeostatic property clusters for natural kinds. Whether we look at the several different kinds of human goodness, or the innumerable different kinds of nonhuman (aesthetic, biological) goodness, even if we hypothesize that a homeostatic property cluster explains each one, it becomes more and more difficult to even imagine exactly which properties those might be, let alone how one set or cluster of properties is a good-making feature in such different entities.

 
Virtue Epistemology
On a related point, Boyd’s discussion of epistemic norms assumes that “good explanations” can be epistemically good without being morally good. Adams is right to say that Boyd’s discussion of epistemic norms is the weakest and also the most opaque of his essay. On Adams’ account, moral goodness and epistemic goodness are both species of excellence related similarly back to the (one) infinite good. This latter account much more plausibly fits the prima facie facts. 

I can here only gesture to the growing field of virtue epistemology.[^7] The intuitive premise, according to Ernest Sosa, is this: “Rational beings pursue and value truth.”[^8] Truth is a value; truth is a good thing. My attaining true beliefs is a good thing, and ought to be pursued. This sense of goodness is not, surely, that of moral goodness in the most narrow sense. But are the two senses completely divorced? When a scientist fakes his data and thus demonstrates a defective devotion to truth, we do not hesitate to apply the term bad, without qualification. Intellectual fraud is, among other things, a moral error. If the (correct) epistemic norms we hold and accord to are or plausibly can be moral-value-laden virtues, then all of the reasoning Boyd constructs on the edifice of a presumptive (moral) value neutrality must be rethought.

The [second] criteria above demands we respect the parity between epistemic and moral norms, between virtues of intellect and will. Boyd denies this parity without argument. Unless he can explain why we should not, we will continue to treat these norms as sharing something in common, even while being distinct.

            <Title>## Conclusion</Title>
            <Text>## Chapter Conclusion ## 

MacIntyre’s work is difficult to pick apart and summarize or critique in fragments. The compressions of his orchestral arguments in this chapter are inevitably going to leave some readers dissatisfied, perhaps even dismayed, by what I have made it appear that he is saying. Readers are of course invited to revisit the source. But if my summaries have captured with any accuracy the outline’s of MacIntyre’s contribution to virtue ethics, then we can say a few things with some confidence: virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. 

Differing traditions explain differing accounts of virtue. Though MacIntyre’s career began in straightforward engagement in dialectical disputes about philosophical ethics, it turned a corner when he thought to treat ethical disagreement in a manner analogous to the way Kuhn treated scientific disagreement. The result of turning this corner — MacIntyre’s own paradigm shift — was an account wherein he argues (similarly to some postmodern philosophers) that malleable traditions define standards of rationality, justice, and virtue. But he also argues, to the chagrin of postmodernists, that traditions are answerable to the world, and can be falsified.  He argues that a thoroughgoing cultural relativism (or “tradition-relativism”?) is inadequate. Such a theory holds the promise to explain why various cultures disagree about what qualities are virtues (humility or pride? acquisitiveness or contentment?) and why the same culture disagrees over time with itself about what exactly defines a particular virtue (is chastity moderation of sexual pleasure or just abstinence?) 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


### Chapter Conclusion There are probably natural teloi as well ### 

Now, MacIntyre later changed his mind about the "metaphysical biology" objection. He later thought that it could be answered a second time, even more strongly. It is not just *social teleology* that necessarily exists as part of our human nature; teleology is in some sense part of non-human nature as well. He came to accept the Thomistic and ultimately Aristotelian argument that natural causes include both efficient/material causes and formal/final. He, along with many others, came to believe that modern science has succeeded *in part because of* an enduring belief in final causation or natural teleology, not because of a rejection. The story about scientists dispensing with final causes in biology and astronomy and chemistry is largely a myth. Scientists and philosophers of science abound who can give empirical and rational grounds for thinking nature is riddled with final causation. 

MacIntyre's *ethical* case does not depend on this more robust account of natural teleology. All it needs is social teleology. But if it turned out that social teleology was in *instance* of natural teleology -- that the ends of human nature were a type of the ends of nature per se -- then the framework in which virtues enable the achievement of human ends would certainly be given additional credibility. 

Making the case on behalf of natural teleology I shall not do here. That is a task for the next chapter.

            <Title>4 Objections</Title>
            <Text>These considerations are not decisive; they are not meant to be so. As Boyd points out, the relative merits of the metaphysical accounts behind Boyd (atheism) and Adams (theism) will change the background plausibility of the metaethical accounts. But also, might not the sword cut the other way? Perhaps we should say that the relative merits of our metaethical account will modify the plausibility of our metaphysical theory, be it theistic or atheistic. Our metaethical account examines our ethical stance, after all, a stance which is as close to us as our very hearts. Our examinations of theism and atheism are liable to be aiming at a putative reality foreign and far outside us. 

Nagel's general direction -- start with defeasible morally realist presumptions and build from there to metaphysics and epistemology -- is right. I am more certain that I ought to care for my children and respect my parents than I am convinced all the world is not exhaustively material nor all the world just my perceptions of an unknowable ideas. 

Regardless, our sensitivity to both the “progress” of new truths in natural scientific inquiry and the (relative) stability of at least some truths of ethical inquiry can better explain the reality of goodness, our epistemic access to it, and our successful deployment of ethical terms, points to a framework more like Adams’, where the good itself is transcendent and yet many (and very different) kinds of things can be good by relation to it. The philosophical naturalist who refuses — rightly so, I think — to retreat to moral antirealism has a tough road ahead. He must fully articulate a plausible framework either that accounts for more natural kinds of goodness, or for other kinds of goodness that are not immediately like natural kinds. But much more so, he must fill in the details of real, natural goodness.</Text>

## How do we live well? ##

How do we live *well*? This is the first question of life that human beings, upon arriving at the age of reflection, ask. It is also the first question of ethical philosophers. 


### Character Ethics

Edmund Pincoffs distinguishes two broad conceptions of philosophical ethics he calls “Quandary Ethics” and “Character Ethics.” Character ethics is focused on the long-term goal of living well as it is to be executed in every day life. Quandary ethics, by contrast, is focused on the short-term resolution of immediate moral problems, either by dissolving moral perplexity or giving some (hopefully rational) basis for a particular decision or course of action. Aristotle is an example of a Character Ethicist. ”[Aristotle] as is well known, thought of ethics as a branch of politics, which in turn he thought of as a very wide-ranging subject having to do generally with the planning of human life so that it could be lived as well as possible. Moral problems are given their due but are by no means stage-centre. The question is not so much how we should resolve perplexities as how we should live."[@pincoffs1971quandary 553-4] The Quandary ethicists are those Pincoffs quotes at the beginning of his article (such as Hare, Toulon, Brandt). They think that “the business of ethics is with " problems ", i.e. situations in which it is difficult to know what one should do; that the ultimate beneficiary of ethical analysis is the person who, in one of these situations, seeks rational ground for the decision he must make; that ethics is therefore primarily concerned to find such grounds, often conceived of as moral rules and the principles from which they can be derived; and that meta-ethics consists in the analysis of the terms, claims, and arguments which come into play in moral disputation, deliberation, and justification in problematic contexts.”[@pincoffs1971quandary 552]


### Practical appraisal and action

MacIntyre puts (what I take to be) the same point in different terms. His earliest ethical work distinguished the significance of moral judgments compared to other kinds of judgments. In a careful critique of both intuitionists such as Moore and emotivists such as Stevenson, MacIntyre concluded that both (mistakenly) assume that moral judgments and moral terms have significance only in their referential meaning. The intuitionists, of course, concluded that moral terms refer to a non-natural property, while the emotivists concluded that moral terms do not refer to such a property and so do not refer at all. (Naturalists, later in the 20th century, argue that moral terms refer to natural properties.) MacIntyre’s alternative denies the assumption entirely; moral judgments “have their own kind of logic” and their significance, like other kinds of judgments, comes from “exhibiting the logic of their usage.”[@murphy2003 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] The significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.” That is their place in “a pattern of language and action…” He continues: 

&gt;Above all they arise out of the way in which we see the world and the way in which our language allows us to see the world. We cannot sufficiently emphasize the direction given to our appraisals by the language which happens to be available for our descriptions. It is as we see the facts that we judge the world.

MacIntyre’s point is that moral judgments are not *simply* useful in moral dilemmas or quandaries. They appear, at the earliest stages of childhood development, in a pattern of usage that is inextricable from the human activities of reasoning, acting, and appraising. Evaluative judgments appear in the widest imaginable spread of human activities, from politics to playgrounds, from sociology to social life, from the practices of law and medicine to the professions of journalism and psychology, from the sciences to the arts. 

Even if this point be granted, moral dilemmas are not *unreal*. Moral dilemmas are a special version of our general “problems of appraisal and action.” They may be particularly vexing, but they are no different from the general problems of how to live, how to be happy, what kinds of public policies to pursue, what apparently meaningful types of life are really meaningful. 

### Gibbard - Planning

Alan Gibbard’s metaethical work has the delightful flavor of a good-natured provocateur. For almost 20 years he has stood almost alone — contra mundum — in defending sophisticated, robust expressivism (though Blackburn and now Schroeder have joined the fight). The evolution of his thought, from *Wise Choices, Apt Feelings* to *Thinking How to Live* demonstrates a sincere intellectual honesty. He has a genuine commitment to heeding substantial critiques and responding to honest critics. 

While I am not a norm-expressivist in his vein, I think his theory full of useful insights. The one that pertains to my introduction here is *planning*. Plan-making is not just one of the many kinds of practical reasoning we engage in; it is almost synonymous with practical reasoning. It is instructive to consider what a plan is not: A plan is not an *action* nor a *motivation*, nor a *justification*, nor an *argument*, nor a *feeling*, nor a *decision*. When friends ask me what I am going to do when I finish graduate school, I say, “I am going to apply for jobs near my family.” That proposition expresses a plan. The plan itself is, we might say, a maxim I endorse: “apply for jobs near family.” But what kind of endorsement is it? It is not a *belief*. I do not intellectually affirm the truth of “applying for jobs near family.” Nor are there any evaluative terms explicit in the plan. I don’t say, “I it good to apply for jobs near family” nor “I am going to apply for jobs in the best possible location, that is, near my family.” Evaluations are not absent from my plan but they are implicit within the plan. It is, we might say, *a given* that my plan takes into account *all* salient factors I possibly can take into account. A friend might challenge my plan: “Near family? Aren’t you going to apply for jobs *everywhere*?” My friend is alluding to the received wisdom that your first job, if it’s a good one, should be taken wherever you can get it, regardless of familiar or social connections. He is implying that being near family is *a* consideration, surely, but is calling me to justify how I weigh out being near family versus getting a job at all. So the endorsement of a plan is, we might say, simply *planning*. Plans are intimately related to intentions. They are end-directed. But a plan seems to me different from an intention in at least one respect: I am not *doing* anything about my plan right now. I am not *executing* the plan. Right now I am working on a dissertation. My intention to finish and defend the dissertation is, so to speak, active at the moment. The plan to apply for jobs near family is dormant — it is hypothetical. That’s why I say, “I am going to…” before stating the plan. I have the intention of executing that plan, but not now. But my commitment to the plan is not therefore somehow less committed. It is not a “dream” of someday maybe applying for jobs. It is a firm, settled, plan to apply for jobs when the time comes. 

All of life is an exercise in plan-making. We deliberate about plans, make plans, lament the failure of plans, try to execute plans, criticize plans, praise plans, discover new plans, scrap old plans when new information comes to light, and (in the twilight of our years) evaluate our plans and how well we reached them. 

###  The problem of disagreement

The question of how to live, and of how to resolve pressing moral disputes and dramatic moral conundrums, is not easy. There are various answers. People disagree.

Anyone who has long engaged in dialectical disputes over the various answer to the normative question of how to live well eventually comes to ask a secondary question: is there even any truth to be found? Are there any ‘right answers’ in ethics? Is there anything to all this discussion besides gas? Some worry that ethics has no ‘right answers’ because it is all just intuition-pumping. Some people view ethics as too easy because it is only a discussion of one’s opinion. 

We must admit that normative ethical conclusions — whatever conclusions satisfy us at the end of a long philosophical discussion about what is good and right — are different from conclusions in paleontology, medicine, or calculus. What does the difference amount to? Why is ethics *as a discipline* so different from, say, natural sciences? 

There are two sorts of interpretations of ethics as a discipline in light of the diversity of answers to the question about how to live well. The first is Hume’s answer, that ethics is “easy” (while metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophical anthropology are presumably difficult). 

The second is Aristotle’s, that ethics is *a different sort of science* because it has a *different subject matter* to which it must correspond. He says, “For a well schooled man is wanting searches for that degree of precision in each kind of study which the nature of the subject at hand admits: is obviously just as foolish to accept arguments of probability from a mathematician has to demand strict demonstrations from an orator.” [@aristotle Book I.3]

By the traditional classification, ethics is a form of philosophy. Russ Shafer-Landau persuasively argues this simple equation in defense of moral realism[@shafer2007ethics] but the point has broader import. If ethics is *not* a species of philosophy, it is something else entirely. Perhaps it is a species of politics. Such a categorization assumes, at the outset, that power prevails over truth. But to concede that there are no right answers in ethics, that ethical philosophers have no hope of finding any ethical truth is to give up on ethics as a discipline. 

So suppose ethics is a species of philosophy. The indirect answer is another question: Are there ‘right answers’ in philosophy? Isn’t the relation of philosophy in general to ethics in particular the relation of genus to species? This is the relation Russ Shafer-Landau argues for.[@shafer2012ethics] So the fate of ethical claims or ethical theories hangs on the fate of philosophical claims and theories as a whole. If we are philosophical optimists at all — if we are not total skeptics or nihilists — then we can be ethical optimists. 

So what species of philosophy is ethics? If philosophy is its genus, what is its differentia? Ethics is the discipline of practical reason. There are ‘right answers’ in ethics since there are right ways to live one’s life, there are wells to live well and ways to live poorly; things can go well or badly for us. One of the fundamental governing assumptions of this work is that there is no special domain of the moral. Value theory is a whole package. There is at bottom no intelligible distinction between morality and prudence. 

The word “ethical” is sometimes taken to have a broader connotation than the narrow “moral,” but I think such distinctions etymologically suspect. As MacIntyre summarizes: “‘moral’ is the etymological descendant of ‘moralis’. But ‘moralis’, like its Greek predecessor ethikos — I invented ‘moralis’ to translate the Greek word in the De Fato — means ‘pertaining to character’ where a man’s character is nothing other than his set dispositions to behave systematically in one way rather than another, to lead on particular kind of life.”[@macintyre1984after 38] The early uses of Moral did not contrast with “‘prudential’ or ‘self interested’” nor with “‘legal or ‘religious’”. MacIntyre concludes: “The word to which it is closest in meaning is perhaps most simply ‘practical’.”

Practicality as a whole domain was sub-divided. The conventional distinction that “morality” is a special sub-division pertaining to right and wrong behavior toward others traces to the 1700s, where “immorality” meant sexual misbehavior.  The conventional separation of “moral” from “non-moral” considerations traces to John Stuart Mill who divided the former domain as concerned with duties to benefit and to not harm others. 

As one MacIntyre scholar puts it: ‘The term practical rationality is derived from Aristotle’s *phronesis*. It is to be distinguished from *sophia*, a more technical form of reasoning. Practical rationality leads to more approximate conclusions; it takes context and relative facts into account, and it usually leads to moral or political conclusions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 60-61] If we take philosophical ethics to be reflection on morality as a whole then, on this view, philosophical ethics is reflection on practical rationality. Practical rationality is simply the process of deciding what to do. It is the process of thinking through what to do. Or, in Gibbard’s unforgettable phrasing, it is “thinking how to live”.[@gibbard2009thinking] 

Rosalind Hursthouse likewise says that: “The concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its possessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or admirable person who acts and feels well, rightly, as she should. These are commonly accepted truisms.”[@sepvirtue] These truisms encompass our everyday moral judgments about who is admirable much more broadly than our judgments about who is morally upstanding or who avoids being morally despicable. There is more to being an admirable person than *avoiding* transgressions. Nicholas Gier’s memorable image of the “couch potato” illustrates this point. The Couch Potato works a mindless job  which he is able adequately to perform while watching television (and today we can add, checking his Facebook and Twitter feeds); he rarely rises except to receive himself and microwave his dinners; he is even religious, watching his favorite preachers on Sunday morning television and tithing regularly. Yet the couch potato is by my standards living a wasted life and pitiable life. (I am counting on your similar intuition.) We do not want to imprison him for being such a failure; but we certainly do not admire how he lives. 

By contrast, admirable people command our respect for being morally upstanding, and so much more. We admire them for their brains, their guts, their strength, their rare talents, their outstanding achievements, their unimaginable creativity, their wit and eloquence. Some people are remarkable for *what they are given* (great beauty, great intelligence, and so on). But the admirable person is remarkable not just for good fortune. In fact, admirable people are often admirable for overcoming extraordinarily bad fortune. We truly admire *what they do* with *what they are given*. In a word, we admire how they live. 

Julia Annas’ presentation of virtue as as a skill illuminates this same point, I think, beautifully. She says, I should develop an account of virtue in which I show have central to the idea that the practical reasoning of the virtuous person is analogous in important ways… to the practical reasoning of someone who's exercising a practical skill.”[@annas2011intelligent 3]. What she calls the “skill analogy” might be taken as problematic since it drains the peculiarly *moral* quality out of virtue; but we might reverse this worry. The skill analogy colors even living one’s daily life with the moral quality of virtue. The virtuous person is *good at* and not just *good* — good at helping others, good at thinking ahead, good at human life. The vicious person, by contrast, is not just bad but *bad at* the essential elements of human life. Of course, being born with a paucity of natural talents is not a matter of immorality. 

How did this broad sense of morality as living life excellently narrow? 

### How did the meaning of ‘morality’ narrow? 

First, it meant any particular way of life — something like idiosyncrasy, habit, character. Second, any practical lesson — something like the “moral of the story”, the point, that to be acted on, the rule, the maxim. Third, a domain of rules of conduct that are “neither theological nor legal nor aesthetic”[@macintyre1984after 39]

Anscombe notes: 

&gt;The terms “should” or “ought” or “needs” relate to good and bad: e.g. machinery needs oil, or should or ought to be oiled, in that running without oil is bad for it, or it runs badly without oil. According to this conception, of course, "should" and "ought" are not used in a special "moral" sense when one says that a man should not bilk. (In Aristotle's sense of the term "moral" [ήθικός], they are being used in connection with a moral subject‑matter: namely that of human passions and [non‑technical] actions.) But they have now acquired a special so‑called "moral" sense-‑i.e. a sense in which they imply some absolute verdict (like one of guilty/not guilty on a man) on what is described in the "ought" sentences used in certain types of context: not merely the contexts that Aristotle would call "moral"‑-passions and actions‑-but also some of the contexts that he would call "intellectual.”[@anscombe1958]

The equation between moral and intellectual excellence is not obvious for us. The notion that morality has to do with absolute verdicts is not obvious to Aristotle — nor to contemporary neo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists. 

Kant admits the apparent inconsistency in radically dividing speculative or theoretical reason from practical reason: 
&gt;Here first is explained the enigma of the critical philosophy, viz. :how we deny objective reality to the supersensible use of the categories in speculation and yet admit this reality with respect to the objects of pure practical reason. This must at first seem inconsistent as long as this practical use is only nominally known.[@kantpracticalreason]


### Three Dimensions of Practical Reason

Now, the domain of duties and obligations pertaining to others is a real domain and a legitimate division. But the division is not between morality and non-morality but between different types of morality or sub-domains. I shall call this domain “2nd-personal morality”, that is, my duties to you or to you all. This domain is vast. But there are other domains for the 1st-person and 3rd-person. 

The entire set is the domain of practicality — what one ought to do or ought to think, say, etc. The three sub-domains are defined by the object with regard to which one ought to do and not do this or that. 

The domain of 1st-person morality is proper respect and care for one’s self — self-love or enlightened self-interest. This is what Mill called the domain of “prudence”. It includes the virtues that benefit both oneself and others (moderation and courage) but especially practical wisdom, without which none of the other virtues do me much good. 

The domain of 3rd-person morality is proper respect and care for everything that is not you or me — animals and plants, pets and work animals, our possessions, our earth and environment, and perhaps even our solar system. The primary virtue of this domain is justice, a respect for the whole and the proper arrangement of all the parts. If God exists, then 3rd-personal morality would require piety to him or her, since on most theisms God is not strictly speaking “one of us” but still demands our allegiance, sacrifice, or what have you. 

The domain of 2nd-person morality, I said, is vast. It includes interpersonal moral obligations, values, and virtues as well as broader social or political ones. I suggest that the dominant virtue here is not only justice but love — I.e., a strong regard for the other, a charitable orientation to promoting the good of others, refusing to harm them, and committing to protect them from harm. 

### Defense? ###

I believe this fundamental assumption of mine is defensible. But it is not defensible a part from the details of the metaethical virtue theory I am trying to work out in the remainder of the book. That is, the critic who arrives at the conclusion of the book and objects to that conclusion may either object to one or more particular chapter or particular claim, or else she may object that such governing assumptions themselves have lead us astray. 

The only response I will offer now is not a defense, strictly speaking. It is a strategic rhetorical reversal of the burden of proof. The response is this: why do we moderns *assume* that there is a special domain of the moral? The ancient and medieval philosophers in the west thought of the domain of practical reason as a natural unit: all that is voluntary or under our control may be done well or badly. Our goal in living well is to to identify what to think, what to do, and what to make. As a corollary, we must identify what not to think, what not to do, and what not to make. But shrinking the whole domain of practical reason down to the domain of a few absolute prohibitions on harming others is a modern innovation. If it is right, then it is a modern invention. If it is wrong, it is a modern ignorance. Either way, its proponent needs, I think, to offer some account of why such a shrinking amounts to progress rather than regress in moral theorizing.

            <Title>### The Great Platitudes </Title>
            <Text>### The Great Platitudes
Some ethical propositions are thought to be self-evidently true: it is good to be good. This is a tautology. And most (if not all) tautologies are trivial.  Other ethical propositions are not tautologous but are so widely and commonly accepted as to be easily mistaken for tautologies: it is good to be kind; cruelty is bad. Pleasure is good. Wise people make good leaders. I ought to keep my promises.  A just society is desirable. Fools are ridiculous and the wise are admirable. “Do good and avoid evil” (called the first principles of practical reason). Moderation is good (called the foundation of all ethics). “Drunkenness” or alcoholism are shameful. The Golden Rule (called the only objective rule in both religious and atheistic moralities). Injustice is bad. We ought to care for children and respect elders. Generosity is admirable. 

Of course, if we define “kindness” simply as “a good disposition to treat others well” then it appears that “it is good to be kind” amounts to the same tautologous proposition “it is good to be good.” But kindness is *not* best defined simply as *something good*. Kindness, it seems to me, and to many others upon reflection, is a special sort of quality we can recognize and name but not ultimately define. Cruelty, likewise, we “know it when we see it.” There is more to our recognition of cruelty than the arbitrary application of “a bad disposition to hurt others.” We know that children who tortures animals for fun is acting cruelly. We try to help him or her to satisfy curiosity or get parental attention through other means. We help them stop nursing a disposition to cruelty. 

These ethical propositions do not seem to me tautologies. Call these non-tautologous but basic ethical propositions Platitudes. Some Platitudes are small, others great. “It is polite to say please” is a Platitude. But “Treat others as you would wish to be treated” is a Great Platitude. 

Some philosophers take their task to be to debunk the Great Platitudes. They wish to explain them away, to explain *why* they are false and *how so many people fall in for them*. The platitudes are either *false* (“know your place” taken as a justification of socio-economic or gender inequality is false) or as trivial; *of course* “murder is unjust” is true because, ‘murder’ is defined as ‘unjust killing.’ 

Other philosophers take their task to be to *underwrite* the great platitudes. They wish to explain them, to explain why they are true and how it is we learn them, preserve them, and (most crucially) live well by taking them as sound practical advice. Both philosophers are sophisticated; but one is sophisticated in attacking and explaining away the Great Platitudes while the other is sophisticated in defending and explaining them. 

As examples of the Debunkers, consider J. L. Mackie and Alan Gibbard. Mackie claims to be running counter to the great tradition of European moral philosophy.[@mackie] Gibbard’s metaethical works aim to capture our common sense belief that morality is objective but without the Platonism. He says, "It might be thought ordinary conceptions of rationality Platonistic or intuitionistic. On the Platonistic Picture coma among the facts of the world are facts of what is rational and what is not. A person of normal mental powers can discern these facts. Judgments of nationality are thus straightforward apprehensions of fact, not through sense perception through a mental faculty analogous to sense perception..."[@gibbard1992wise 155]

As examples of Defenders, consider G. E. Moore, Robert Adams, and Frank Jackson. Moore’s grandiloquent denouncements of moral philosophy are not, as one might expect, the harbingers of a revolutionary transvaluation of values; by the end of *Principia Ethica* he has given a sophisticated 300 page articulation of the yawningly common judgment that beauty, friendship, and knowledge are goods. Robert Adams’ metaethical work aims to capture the common sense belief that morality is objective… by providing a systematic defense of Platonism. Plato sees goodness as becoming like god: “Fleeing [evil] is becoming like god so far as one can, and to become like god is to become just and pious with wisdom.[@plato *Statesman* 176a5-b2; @armstrong2004after] And Adams defends this resemblance relation as well. But not all Defenders are non-naturalists. Frank Jackson’s influential account of functionalism[@jackson1998metaphysics] aims to naturalize “mature folk morality” without necessarily invalidating all of it. 

It does no good to object that the Great Platitudes are *evil* or *oppressive*, binding women to social subjugation or condemning the poor to poverty. Rather, the corrections to the errors of European (and more broadly, western) moral philosophy are contained *within the resources* of western moral philosophy. “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” tells more powerfully against sexism or classism than any revolutionary ideal. </Text>

            <Text>Abstract: What is the purpose of metaethics? On one popular view, the purpose of metaethical theories is simply explain our moral talk. Now, our moral talk is not a simple, singular phenomenon: We evaluate people for their moral and intellectual qualities, and we also evaluate living things, systems, and non-living things. I call such a broad range of evaluative talk “normative discourse”. Metaethical theories try to explain or should try to explain such normative discourse. So in the debate over naturalism and non-naturalism, we cannot simply give an account of narrowly moral normativity and leave it at that. By applying this criterion, I critically appraise Richard Boyd’s concept of homeostatic property clusters and Robert Adams’ concept of “being for” the good.

            <Title>The Virtue of Promise-Keeping</Title>
            <Text>Oath-breakers are despicable. Promise-keepers are admirable. We take these truths to be self-evident. 
Promise-making is something only (as far as we know) humans can do. Promises are artifacts of language, and the kind of language apparently only we have. Promise-making is distinctively human; so promise-breaking is distinctively human. As one professor whom I had for a biology class at the Cypress Community College put it, “Humans are worse than ants, for ants cooperate; worse than penguins, for penguins raise their own; worse than black widows, for black widows only kill one at a time.” It is true that humans are (potentially) worse than the worst chimp or dolphin or vermin. But likewise humans are (potentially) better than the best chimp or dolphin or elephant. Promise-keeping is a virtue (as far as we know) only we can do. 
Speaking about “virtues” is liable to invite the objection: which virtues? Whose justice? I propose to keep the virtue of promise-keeping firmly in view. Drawing up a list of virtues is difficult. For, if virtues exist, is there a finite list? Secondly, those of various traditions or worldview are liable to object to one or another virtue on rival lists. Is magnanimity still a virtue, as Aristotle taught? Is humility a vice, as Nietzsche taught? 
But one cannot write about “virtue” in general without examples in view. I will be restricting myself to three sets. The first set has only one member: promise-keeping. The habit of keeping promises, the quality of reliably making and following through with what one says, fulfilling business contracts, showing up at the time and date you said you would for personal appointments. 
The second set is the classical Greek set of virtues: justice, courage, moderation, and practical wisdom. Diakosyne, andrea, sophresune, and phronesis. I have heard arguments that injustice is “better” for a person than justice (think Thrasymachus). I have never heard anyone seriously defend immoderation as a virtue: a cursory search through JSTOR, Philosopher’s Index, and Google Scholar reveals no results for the phrase “a defense of drunkenness.” Alcoholism may be a sickness or a vice or both, but it is not a virtue. Similarly, practical foolishness is never praised, even by Erasmus. A fool without power is a clown — either an annoyance or welcome comic relief. A fool with power is a villain, dangerous, and rightly feared. No one wants Dumb and Dumber flying the 747.</Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>“Every soul pursues the good and does whatever it does for its sake. It divines that the good is something but is perplexed and cannot adequately grasp what it is.” Plato, Republic 505e-506a.

What is the purpose of metaethics?Thanks to David Bradshaw, Timothy Sundell, Terrence Cuneo, Russ Shafer-Landau, Alan Gibbered, Peter Schaber, and the audiences at University of Michigan for helpful comments on drafts of this paper.  Is it to explain moral disagreement? (Schroeder) Is it to discover an objective basis underwriting our moral judgments or show why such discovery is impossible? (Shafer-Landau 2005, 1) To explore the foundations of moral values, properties, and words? (DeLapp) To understand the presuppositions of moral talk? (Sayre-McCord 2012). On one popular view, the purpose of metaethical theories is simply to explain our moral talk (Schroeder 2005; Gibbard 2008). I think this popular view is right. Anti-realists explain why the ethical talk is massively mistaken in some way, but show why we (nonetheless) talk like that (Rosen). Realists explain why moral talk is aspiring to refer to moral facts and express moral truths and how sometimes (or indeed often) it succeeds at doing so, giving accounts of just what moral facts are, how we might come to moral knowledge, and so on (Shafer-Landau 2005; Timmons). 

Section I
In the first section I elaborate just what the domain of “moral talk” includes, arguing for a broader set of data we might call “normative talk,” including but not limited to talk of morals, epistemic virtues, human and non-human goods, and beauty, and so on. These diverse normative concepts, words, and propositions belong to a natural family of normative discourse, or so I shall argue.  

Section II
In the second section, I apply this thesis to the debate over naturalism and non-naturalism. The point is that we cannot simply give an account of narrowly moral normativity and leave it at that. Another way of putting the same point: the domain of ethics is not just the domain of prohibitions about, say, harming others, but the domain of ethos encompasses law, politics, morality, prudence, beauty, order, and truth. If our metaethical theory only explains “ethical” talk in the narrow sense of the term, it is inadequate even if true. 

Section III
In the third section, with the criterion of section II  in mind, I critique Richard Boyd’s metaethical proposal that ‘good’ and like terms pick out a special sort of natural kind (which he calls homeostatic property clusters). I commend, instead, something more like Robert Adam’s metaethical proposal that ‘good’ picks out a transcendent but unitary property that is recognizably one despite being instantiated in a wide variety of domains and particular objects. 
The point here is not that satisfying this criterion automatically guarantees that Adams’ theory is correct. Although I think it is correct, my point here is to raise the bar for what counts as an adequate metaethical theory that purports to explain moral talk. Such theories should be broader metanormative theories, or should constituted a clearly defined part of, broader metanormative theories.

To anticipate my conclusions here: I shall argue that  our most stable and cogent ethical thinking, and our most incorrigible ethical principles, sit better in a framework where the good is understood to be transcendent and unitary.  (1) Adams’ account most accurately explains the intuitive truth that we ought to be open to revising many ethical beliefs but that there are some that we (already) know certainly enough that we ought not be open to revising them. (2) Boyd’s homeostatic property cluster idea, though impressive and thorough, is not yet ambitious enough to even aspire to explain the numerous (and apparently irreducible) various kinds of goodness (and beauty, and excellence, etc.) but restricts itself to human welfare, which is only part of an adequate metaethics. And (3) epistemic norms are more closely related to ethical norms than Boyd would like to admit.

Section IV
Finally, in section four, I respond to two objections: such a framework is problematically theistic, so for those who lean toward atheism or agnosticism, they should not accept a unitary and transcendent good without an entirely different set of arguments from the philosophy of religion; and secondly, that the unity and transcendence of the good is problematically non-naturalistic, so for naturalists they should remain agnostic and wait for further research.

Consider a typical Westerner’s belief that she herself has the right not to be tortured for entertainment. The model sketched above says little about the precise nature of the proximate processes by which this belief is produced; the model is compatible with a wide range of possible proximate processes. To see this, consider two simple possibilities. One possibility is that the process is intuition-driven. A number of thinkers suggest that at least some moral truths are self-evident and can simply be “seen” to be true in a direct way.29 C. S. Lewis colorfully puts it this way: “The primary moral principles on which all others depend are rationally perceived. . . . Their intrinsic reasonableness shines by its own light.”

I will not take a stand on this issue. Regardless of whether intuitions themselves confer justification, it can be the case that some intuition-triggered moral beliefs are produced by reliable processes and that being so produced confers warrant on them.33 My focus here will be on reliability as a source of warrant, though this focus should not be taken to mean that I reject the possibility of other sources of warrant. A second possibility is that the proximate process is largely emotion driven. For instance, perhaps the process involves the disposition to become outraged when treated in certain ways by others (or when facing a threat of being so treated), and this outrage causes one to form the belief that one has certain rights (and that they are, or are in danger of, being violated). The model sketched above is compatible with both of these possibilities, as well as with a host of more complicated options.34 However, it is clear enough that whatever the precise nature of the process, it is one that requires the presence of certain cognitive capacities for its occurrence. In order to form the belief that one has certain rights, one must be able to have some grasp of the concept of rights. While there are various theories about the foundation of rights, it is widely agreed that if rights exist at all, their presence is guaranteed by the presence of certain cognitive faculties.35

The model I propose here is similar to one presented by David Enoch. Enoch offers what he calls a “third-factor explanation” to account for the correspondence between moral facts and human moral beliefs. 36 He explains: “It is possible that the explanation of a correlation between the two factors A and B is in terms of a third factor, C, that is (roughly speaking) responsible both for A-facts and for B-facts.” 37 This description captures the essence of my own strategy, though the third factor I identify is different from Enoch’s third factor. Enoch’s third factor is the goodness of survival or reproductive success.38 My third factor is certain cognitive faculties. Such faculties are responsible for the presence of moral rights in that the presence of the relevant faculties entails the presence of rights. Thus, the connection between the cognitive faculties and moral rights is logical. These same faculties also generate moral beliefs, including the relevant beliefs about rights. The connection between the cognitive faculties and beliefs about moral rights is causal. In this way, the relevant cognitive faculties are responsible for both moral rights and beliefs about those rights, and so the cognitive faculties explain the correlation between moral rights and beliefs about those rights.

Gilbert Harman was perhaps the first contemporary philosopher to outline a case against moral knowledge based on the claim that human moral beliefs can be explained without appealing to any moral truths.43 His worry was roughly this: if moral facts do not explain moral beliefs, then they do not explain anything at all, and if they do not explain anything at all, then we should conclude that they do not exist.44 If there are no moral facts, then there is no moral knowledge. This argument has been the subject of much debate. I agree with Russ Shafer-Landau’s view that this debunking rests on an implausible criterion for existence (what Shafer-Landau calls the “strong causal test of ontological credibility”).45 However, as this argument is a metaphysical rather than epistemological debunking and my focus here is on epistemological debunkings, I will put this argument aside.

It is widely held that if moral properties are exemplified at all, they supervene on nonmoral properties.49 This supervenience thesis entails that any two possible worlds that are identical with respect to their nonmoral properties are identical with respect to their moral properties. If this supervenience thesis is correct, then Ruse’s argument fails.

(3) If S’s moral belief that P can be explained without appealing to the truth of P, then S’s moral belief that P being true would be a lucky coincidence. (4) If S’s moral belief that P being true would be a lucky coincidence, then S’s moral belief that P lacks warrant. From (3) and (4) we can infer: (P2) If S’s moral belief that P can be explained without appealing to the truth of P, then S’s moral belief that P lacks warrant. The weak link of this argument is (3). The model of moral knowledge I sketched earlier shows how a moral belief that P can be true when the belief is not explained by P without the truth of the belief being a lucky coincidence. According to that model, the presence of the very cognitive faculties that cause (or at least causally contribute to) my belief that I have certain rights also entails that I have those very rights. Furthermore, the process that produces this belief is a reliable one, and hence the belief constitutes knowledge. Something similar is true of my belief that other people have the same rights that I have.

David Enoch suggests that the fundamental challenge Street’s argument poses for the normative realist “is that of coming up with an explanation of a correlation between our relevant beliefs and the relevant truths.” 59 Some comments Street makes in a later paper support this interpretation. For instance, in the later paper Street declares that “the [Darwinian] dilemma notes the striking coincidence between the independent normative truths posited by the realist and the normative views that evolutionary forces pushed us toward, and challenges the realist to explain this coincidence.” 60 The realist is hamstrung in this task by the fact that there is no causal connection between moral facts and moral beliefs. As I noted earlier, Enoch and I both propose a “thirdfactor” explanation to account for the correspondence between moral facts and human moral beliefs. My third factor is certain cognitive faculties: the relevant cognitive faculties secure a correlation between moral rights and beliefs about moral rights because they entail the presence of moral rights and generate beliefs about such rights.61 It might

            <Title>### Moral education, end of life</Title>
            <Text>### Moral Education ####

Often the biggest and most obvious facts are the hardest to see. For example, when I ask students to point out anything they see — anything at all, hidden or apparent —  they typically look around and start naming medium-sized objects in their field of vision: this chair, that wall, that tree, that person, or perhaps those atoms and molecules, that sunlight. They never say the biggest and most obvious thing: the ground. 

When discussing the morality of adults, we often leave out the biggest and most obvious source of our morality. The source of our morality is not our professors in college, our ethics textbooks, our favorite novel, or even (for religious folk) our Holy Bible. The biggest and most obvious fact about our morality (and our moral psychology and a whole lot else) is our parents. 

Most of us grew up in the context of nuclear families. So our biological parent or parents both conceived, raised, cared for, and educated us — including education in do’s and don’ts of life. 

The reason we must keep parents in mind is that the two most significant periods, in one sense of significance, of our ethical lives are the very beginning and the very end. 

The latter phase of human life, say, from 50-80 (for those who live that long) is the period in which our habits are most firmly established and the consequences of our choices are most apparent. There is a time delay between the decision to cultivate a character trait and the rewards (or punishments) of becoming that kind of person. 

The middle period (say, ages 25-55) are where we are most autonomous. We are fully functioning agents. We have projects, aims, goals, ethical principles (or a principled lack thereof), weaknesses, given temptations, vices, defects, as well as strengths, virtues, and a host of other habits we may call morally neutral. This is also the period when we philosophers tend to write books about morality. But just because this is the period in which moral philosophers write books about morality doesn’t mean this period is the most moral significant. 

There is a truism that all the really significant doctrines about life — all the really impactful beliefs and habits — we don’t learn in school; we learn them all by the time we enter school (around age 5). We learn how to relate to other humans, how to relate to authority, how to speak our native language, we learn (for the most part, but not exclusively) what is valuable in life — learning, money, position, friendship, power, and so on. </Text>

            <Title>### We are practical reasoners ### </Title>
            <Text>### We are practical reasoners ### 

### Human virtue as practical reasoning since human nature is practical reason
As for human nature, human beings are practical reasoners; we are dependent, rational animals. That is what we are. And yes, we have natures. That word and that concept are not out-dated, outmoded, irrelevant, obsolete, unscientific, or any other such slur. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] And we are practical reasoners (more on that below). We are in a position to see how MacIntyre’s account of virtue works. We find ourselves in a tradition (or more than one). Within that, we find ourselves engaging in practices. We engage in some of these practices inside, and others outside, institutions. Virtues are those skills that enable us to perform the practice excellently; virtues are also those skills and habits by which we perform various social roles excellently; but finally virtues are those qualities by which we aim our practices toward an excellent human life, and by which we integrate our various social roles toward human ends. For instance, the most general virtuous qualities contribute to the flourishing of human being qua practical reasoner. The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. The “human nature” that is universally distributed across each member of our species is the capacity (sometimes unrealized) to become practical reasoners. This  makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. 


### Phronesis

Prudence or phronesis is the master virtue in that it complements every other moral virtue. MacIntyre defends Aristotle’s conception of the practical syllogism wherein the major premise is an evaluative judgment about a virtue or action-type; the minor premise is a truth judgment about a situation or action-token; the conclusion is *an action*. For example, “I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting a student’s attempt to bribe me for a higher grade. This student is attempting to bribe me for a higher grade. Therefore, in this case, I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting this student’s attempt to bribe me.” Without moral virtues, prudence is simply the knowledge of *what is to be done*. Without prudence, the moral virtues are simply skills or habits that might be serviceable to bad ends; one might be excellent in achieving *what is not be done*. 

### Practical Reasoners

We are practical reasoners. Observations we can readily make to support this axiom are so abundant it is hard to know where to start: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. 

Each of these situations, I hope, so familiar that my analysis will not (yet!) be controversial. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

If this is true, the converse would be true: those who are not practical reasoners, or not in community, are not human. Regardless of whether this strikes a false note for the reader, it is at least intelligible. this corollary is the natural extension of the Greek view that exile was on par with, if not worse than, public execution. To remove you from your community is in an important sense to destroy you as a person. A hanging or poisoning only destroys you as a body. An exile is far worse than that. It rips you from your context, tears out from the social fabric the thread that you are. It turns you, while existing, into a non-being, a non-entity, an object. Regardless of whether we can sympathize with this way of thinking about exile, we can understand how one can be demoted from human status. 

We should not say that a non-practical-reasoner is not human, but that they fail to be exemplary. Brain-dead, or mentally handicapped, or injured etc., persons are not non-human but they are importantly defective qua humans, as I think common sense can recognize.

            <Title>Natural Teleology </Title>
            <Text>
### What if there are no ends in nature? ##

One powerful objection to the recovery of telos is that there is no teleology in nature. There are no *ends* (τελοι). Call this position *teleological nihilism.* There are two forms of teleological nihilism: extreme and moderate. Extreme teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no "purposes" or natural ends anywhere in the world *including* in human actions. Even our practices, behaviors, and lives are purposeless, even to ourselves. Moderate teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no natural purposes *except* those in human actions, intentions, and societies, etc. On moderate teleological nihilism, human purposes are not instances of a broader category that includes the tendency of an acorn to become an oak and the tendency of deer to survive and reproduce; human purposes are sui generis phenomena that spontaneously emerge out of our brains at a certain level of complexity. Final causation thinking is then projected out onto the world by us; we observe that the beaver gathered wood and that the beaver built a dam and we say "the beaver gathered wood *in order to* build the dam." But really the beaver did no such thing. This is what philosopher of biology Ernst Mayr calls "teleonomic" natural behavior, but not genuinely teleological.[@mayr1992teleology] 

Teleological nihilism claims as its evidence *modern science* as a whole. Natural sciences have dismissed the notion of final causation for three or four centuries now and have gotten along well without it. In fact, natural sciences and the experimental, empirical methods that advance them have progressed far more than anyone could have dreamed. In part, this success is the result of giving up magical thinking. 

### What if ends are reducible? ###

Teleoreductionism has taken one of two popular forms: the first reduces 'teleonomic' (that is, apparently teleological) biological functions to causal contributions to a system and the second reduces teleonomic biological functions to naturally selected effects. A proponent of the first reduction is Donald Davidson; a proponent of the second is Ruth Millikan. 

### Reducible reply ###

Neither forms of 'teleoreduction' can account for the normativity of the biological function in question. If hearts simply cause %%

James Barham elaborates:

&gt;I was aware of well-known criticisms of both of the then-current reductionist accounts of function: the "causal-role" theory and the Darwin-inspired "selected-effects" theory. In a nutshell, the problem is that neither theory can explain the normative character of biological processes in a coherent manner. (Biological processes are "normative" in the sense that they may either succeedor fail in fulfilling their functions.) With respect to the "causal-role" theory, there is no way to distinguish between functional and non-functional parts of a biological system without presupposing the normative character of the overall system as a whole -- which begs the question at issue.
&gt;With respect to the "selected-effects" theory, the problem is that selection history is conceptually irrelevant to the identification of function. True, it has a role to play in explaining how present-day functions have come to exist. But selection history cannot possibly explain what it is about a biological process that constitutes it as a function. This is a logical point that Darwinists simply miss. The reason is that our concept of function in no way depends on evolutionary history. If it did, then biologists like Aristotle, Galen, Harvey, and innumerable others who lived long before Darwin would not have had the means to identify the functions of organs, which they of course did. Sometimes, they got it wrong, as when Aristotle placed the seat of perception and thought in the heart, instead of the brain (though some of his predecessors got it right). But Aristotle's mistake was due to his inadequate knowledge of physiology, not to his ignorance of evolution.

Millikan bites the bullet on this objection. She isn't trying to do "conceptual analysis" of the term 'function.' She is willing to admit that her concept of proper function only applies to functional objects with histories and that hypothetical counterexamples involving functional objects without histories prove that two objects with one and the same "*mark* of purposiveness" can have different functions.[


### No Telos Reply ###



### Biological Teleology

Teleological realism in biology is making a come-back. There are those who protest teleological nihilism. Arnhart persuasively argues that teleology is assumed in medicine.[@arnhart1988] Zammito clarifies ongoing relevance in biology, since organisms seem to be intrinsically purposeful.[@zammito2006teleology]

In a series of important articles and books over the past decade or so, Bedau (1990, 1992a, 1992b, 1993), Cameron (2004), Christensen &amp; Bickhard (2002), Jacobs (1986), Manning (1997), Maund (2000), McLaughlin (2001, 2009), Mossio et al. (2009), Mundale &amp; Bechtel (1996), Nanay (2010), Nissen (1997), Perovic (2007), Walsh (2006), and Zammito (2006) have cast grave doubt on the coherence of any reductive analysis of function. Some of these authors (e.g., Jacobs, Maund, Zammito) call explicitly for a reconsideration of the possibility that teleological phenomena in biology might be both objectively real and irreducible. 

The very word 'teleology' is liable to sound quaint to modern ears. Barnham clarifes the range of terms that denote identical or similar concepts: 

&gt;"By “teleology,” I have in mind such words and concepts as “purpose,” “end,” “goal,” “function,” “control,” and “regulation,” as well as the real- world biological phenomena to which these words and concepts refer. This means that the word “teleology” should always be construed here in its internal or “immanent” sense—purposiveness existing in living beings themselves—and never in its external or “transcendent” sense of an overarching cosmic principle" (Barnham 1). For a similar distinction, see Lennox (1992) and Brown (2001). 

We can add "purposive" and "goal-directed" to the constellation of concepts in the offing.

            <Title>Dissertation Proposal D4? </Title>
            <Text>How do we live well? This is a question every person asks at some point in his or her life, either because life is so clearly not going well or perhaps due to a longing for something more, and better.
This is the question that many philosophers have asked and attempted to answer. And there is no end to rival answers. 
Religious people have a simple answer: obey God. For Christians, Jews, and Muslims, for instance, living well means fulfilling one’s role in relation to the supreme creator: sacrifice, honor, worship, love, prayer, and so on — and also loving one’s fellow man. Even this “simple answer” is complicated when we ask the follow up question: What does God command? What exactly are my roles and obligations to God? 
Non-religious people have variety of answers to the question, how do we live well? Fulfill your deepest and most authentic desires; honor your ancestors; become a fully actualized self; protect and benefit the less fortunate; win fame, wealth, and power in entertainment, business, or politics; support and raise a family. 
Each of these answers may be considered a life plan. A life plan, roughly, is a set of instructions or recommendations for how to succeed in the long-term. It includes explicit or assumed criteria for “success”. It includes recommendations not only for what to do in this or that situation in the short-term projects (how to study for the SAT/ACT, how to compose a resume) but what to do at major turning points that often characterize human life (birth, education, marriage, career, child-bearing, deaths in the family, middle-age, and one’s own death). Life plans are more specific than principles but more flexible than maxims or commandments. A single life plan can unite an entire culture without hindering the bewildering variety of different and unique individuals from expressing their own individuality and fulfilling their own identity. 
Yet despite the variety of (often contradictory) life plans, we can observe a common thread. Regardless of the time, place, culture, religion (or lack thereof) and language of the advice-giver, all these life plans tell us something about what it means to be human. ‘How do we live well?’ is a question about us. So obviously the answer will assume or make explicit some understanding of who we are. The secular humanist and the Christian theist can agree that, whatever the best life plan, it will enable human to become who they really are, to be excellent humans. 
For this reason, virtue theory is especially interesting. A virtue, by definition, manliness. ‘Manliness’ is not to be understood here in sexist terms as exclusively masculine, but as humanliness. There is a presumption of what human nature is, is not and could never be, and is not but could be. 
These investigations can be ventured with the historical tradition in view or they can be taken up by us, again, from our own point of view, today. Historically, what did Aristotle think? What have other virtue ethicists thought? For Aristotle, and those in the Aristotelian tradition, the goal of living well animates discussion about character traits that virtually every person in virtually every culture intuitively recognizes as admirable: courage, promise-keeping, moderation, truth-telling. Even Nietzsche, that great moral skeptic, that great troll, that great rabble-rouser, commended those who would throw off slave morality for their courage. He insinuated that it takes “courage” to deny the truth and to deceive oneself — unable to fully buck the assumption that courage was an objective moral good. 
So when we examine these admirable traits there are a few questions that arise. What is a virtue? And how many are there? What is the list of virtues — which traits are truly virtuous? Since “living virtuously” is supposed to answer the question about living well, can we say more about “wellness,” — health, success, happiness, good fortune, flourishing? 
Virtues, Aquinas taught, are not contrary to human nature but are not automatic. Is there even such thing as human nature? 
Humans, Darwin taught, are animals with the same backstory as every other animal. Does our evolutionary history teach us anything about what character traits are admirable, or about the moral faculty by which we discern what is admirable and despicable? 
The contemporary virtue ethicists who also explore these primary ethical answers to the fundamental practical question about how to live well and who also explore these higher-order abstract questions are Anscombe, MacIntyre, Foot, Hursthouse, MacDowell, Nussbaum, Thompson, and others. They each offer a virtue account and respond to various objections. For instance, virtue theory (like any other moral realism) must deal with the problem of disagreement, the worry that if reasonable parties disagree about a matter then there is no fact of the matter. 
This dissertation is and exploration and answer the question how to live well. It responds to a variety of the most pressing and interesting objections to the virtue theories of MacIntyre, Foot, Hursthouse, and others. </Text>

            <Text>## Chapter Conclusion ##

MacIntyre’s work is difficult to pick apart and summarize or critique in fragments. The compressions of his orchestral arguments in this chapter are inevitably going to leave some readers dissatisfied, perhaps even dismayed, by his theories. what I have made it appear that he is saying. Readers are of course invited to revisit the source. But if my summaries have captured with any accuracy the outline’s of MacIntyre’s contribution to virtue ethics, then we can say a few things with some confidence: virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. 

Differing traditions explain differing accounts of virtue. Though MacIntyre’s career began in straightforward engagement in dialectical disputes about philosophical ethics, it turned a corner when he thought to treat ethical disagreement in a manner analogous to the way Kuhn treated scientific disagreement. The result of turning this corner — MacIntyre’s own paradigm shift — was an account wherein he argues (similarly to some postmodern philosophers) that malleable traditions define standards of rationality, justice, and virtue. But he also argues, to the chagrin of postmodernists, that traditions are answerable to the world, and can be falsified.  He argues that a thoroughgoing cultural relativism (or “tradition-relativism”?) is inadequate. Such a theory holds the promise to explain why various cultures disagree about what qualities are virtues (humility or pride? acquisitiveness or contentment?) and why the same culture disagrees over time with itself about what exactly defines a particular virtue (is chastity moderation of sexual pleasure or just abstinence?) 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


### Chapter Conclusion There are probably natural teloi as well

Now, MacIntyre later changed his mind about the "metaphysical biology" objection. He later thought that it could be answered a second time, even more strongly. It is not just *social teleology* that necessarily exists as part of our human nature; teleology is in some sense part of non-human nature as well. He came to accept the Thomistic and ultimately Aristotelian argument that natural causes include both efficient/material causes and formal/final. He, along with many others, came to believe that modern science has succeeded *in part because of* an enduring belief in final causation or natural teleology, not because of a rejection. The story about scientists dispensing with final causes in biology and astronomy and chemistry is largely a myth. Scientists and philosophers of science abound who can give empirical and rational grounds for thinking nature is riddled with final causation. 

MacIntyre's *ethical* case does not depend on this more robust account of natural teleology. All it needs is social teleology. But if it turned out that social teleology was in *instance* of natural teleology -- that the ends of human nature were a type of the ends of nature per se -- then the framework in which virtues enable the achievement of human ends would certainly be given additional credibility. 

Making the case on behalf of natural teleology I shall not do here. That is a task for the next chapter. 

### MacIntyre’s Greatness

Great thinkers — Plato, Aquinas, Kant — have a distinguishing feature of presenting a totalizing theory that not only explains a whole host of phenomena and solves problems, but explain why critics criticize. Great thinkers present not only philosophical solutions to philosophical problems, but a definition or understanding of philosophy itself. They are always philosophers *and* metaphilosophers. 

One of the features so satisfying to adherents of Plato, Aquinas, Kant (I could have mentioned a dozen others) is that their totalizing theory puts agreement in context and puts disagreement with the theory in context. It casts critics in a particular light. This is satisfying to adherents but infuriating to critics. 

One of the signs, I believe, of MacIntyre’s greatness is just this feature. He presents not only isolated theories but a theoretical system in which critics, depending on their criticism, receive a name, a number, a category, a classification, and a designated response. Adherents, too, are accommodated. But to criticize MacIntyre is much trickier business than one might suspect at first. Critics find themselves dipping into one of many already well-poisoned wells, and falling into pre-laid traps. The critic who would escape the battery is more likely to flee rather than engage; but the critic who would escape by engaging and overcoming is liable to meet her match. 

Again, while this may be infuriating, it is a sign of greatness.

            <Title>### Moral education, end of life</Title>
            <Text>### Moral Education ####

The beginning and end of practical life are the least discussed but most important. 

Often the biggest and most obvious facts are the hardest to see. For example, when I ask students to point out anything they see — anything at all, hidden or apparent —  they typically look around and start naming medium-sized objects in their field of vision: this chair, that wall, that tree, that person, or perhaps those atoms and molecules, that sunlight. They never say the biggest and most obvious thing: the ground. 

When discussing the morality of adults, we often leave out the biggest and most obvious source of our morality. The source of our morality is not our professors in college, our ethics textbooks, our favorite novel, or even (for religious folk) our Holy Bible. The biggest and most obvious fact about our morality (and our moral psychology and a whole lot else) is our parents. 

Most of us grew up in the context of nuclear families. So our biological parent or parents both conceived, raised, cared for, and educated us — including education in do’s and don’ts of life. 

The reason we must keep parents in mind is that the two most significant periods, in one sense of significance, of our ethical lives are the very beginning and the very end. 

The latter phase of human life, say, from 50-80 (for those who live that long) is the period in which our habits are most firmly established and the consequences of our choices are most apparent. There is a time delay between the decision to cultivate a character trait and the rewards (or punishments) of becoming that kind of person. 

The middle period (say, ages 25-55) are where we are most autonomous. We are fully functioning agents. We have projects, aims, goals, ethical principles (or a principled lack thereof), weaknesses, given temptations, vices, defects, as well as strengths, virtues, and a host of other habits we may call morally neutral. This is also the period when we philosophers tend to write books about morality. But just because this is the period in which moral philosophers write books about morality doesn’t mean this period is the most moral significant. 

There is a truism that all the really significant doctrines about life — all the really impactful beliefs and habits — we don’t learn in school; we learn them all by the time we enter school (around age 5). We learn how to relate to other humans, how to relate to authority, how to speak our native language, we learn (for the most part, but not exclusively) what is valuable in life — learning, money, position, friendship, power, and so on. </Text>

            <Title>### The Great Platitudes </Title>
            <Text>### The Great Platitudes
Some ethical propositions are thought to be self-evidently true: it is good to be good. This is a tautology. And most (if not all) tautologies are trivial.  Other ethical propositions are not tautologous but are so widely and commonly accepted as to be easily mistaken for tautologies: it is good to be kind; cruelty is bad. Pleasure is good. Wise people make good leaders. I ought to keep my promises.  A just society is desirable. Fools are ridiculous and the wise are admirable. “Do good and avoid evil” (called the first principles of practical reason). Moderation is good (called the foundation of all ethics). “Drunkenness” or alcoholism are shameful. The Golden Rule (called the only objective rule in both religious and atheistic moralities). Injustice is bad. We ought to care for children and respect elders. Generosity is admirable. 

Of course, if we define “kindness” simply as “a good disposition to treat others well” then it appears that “it is good to be kind” amounts to the same tautologous proposition “it is good to be good.” But kindness is *not* best defined simply as *something good*. Kindness, it seems to me, and to many others upon reflection, is a special sort of quality we can recognize and name but not ultimately define. Cruelty, likewise, we “know it when we see it.” There is more to our recognition of cruelty than the arbitrary application of “a bad disposition to hurt others.” We know that children who tortures animals for fun is acting cruelly. We try to help him or her to satisfy curiosity or get parental attention through other means. We help them stop nursing a disposition to cruelty. 

These ethical propositions do not seem to me tautologies. Call these non-tautologous but basic ethical propositions Platitudes. Some Platitudes are small, others great. “It is polite to say please” is a Platitude. But “Treat others as you would wish to be treated” is a Great Platitude. 

Some philosophers take their task to be to debunk the Great Platitudes. They wish to explain them away, to explain *why* they are false and *how so many people fall in for them*. The platitudes are either *false* (“know your place” taken as a justification of socio-economic or gender inequality is false) or as trivial; *of course* “murder is unjust” is true because, ‘murder’ is defined as ‘unjust killing.’ 

Other philosophers take their task to be to *underwrite* the great platitudes. They wish to explain them, to explain why they are true and how it is we learn them, preserve them, and (most crucially) live well by taking them as sound practical advice. Both philosophers are sophisticated; but one is sophisticated in attacking and explaining away the Great Platitudes while the other is sophisticated in defending and explaining them. 

As examples of the Debunkers, consider J. L. Mackie and Alan Gibbard. Mackie claims to be running counter to the great tradition of European moral philosophy.[@mackie] Gibbard’s metaethical works aim to capture our common sense belief that morality is objective but without the Platonism. He says, "It might be thought ordinary conceptions of rationality Platonistic or intuitionistic. On the Platonistic Picture coma among the facts of the world are facts of what is rational and what is not. A person of normal mental powers can discern these facts. Judgments of nationality are thus straightforward apprehensions of fact, not through sense perception through a mental faculty analogous to sense perception..."[@gibbard1992wise 155]

As examples of Defenders, consider G. E. Moore, Robert Adams, and Frank Jackson. Moore’s grandiloquent denouncements of moral philosophy are not, as one might expect, the harbingers of a revolutionary transvaluation of values; by the end of *Principia Ethica* he has given a sophisticated 300 page articulation of the yawningly common judgment that beauty, friendship, and knowledge are goods. Robert Adams’ metaethical work aims to capture the common sense belief that morality is objective… by providing a systematic defense of Platonism. Plato sees goodness as becoming like god: “Fleeing [evil] is becoming like god so far as one can, and to become like god is to become just and pious with wisdom.[@plato *Statesman* 176a5-b2; @armstrong2004after] And Adams defends this resemblance relation as well. But not all Defenders are non-naturalists. Frank Jackson’s influential account of functionalism[@jackson1998metaphysics] aims to naturalize “mature folk morality” without necessarily invalidating all of it. 

It does no good to object that the Great Platitudes are *evil* or *oppressive*, binding women to social subjugation or condemning the poor to poverty. Rather, the corrections to the errors of European (and more broadly, western) moral philosophy are contained *within the resources* of western moral philosophy. “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” tells more powerfully against sexism or classism than any revolutionary ideal. 

### Defense of the Cutting Edge, Defense of the Foundation ###

It might be objected by some that ethics is (or ought to be) about controversies. We don’t want urgently to know about what moral terms mean, what the concept of a moral fact is, whether moral facts exist, whether virtue talk is ineliminable from ethics, what qualities count as virtues, how virtues pertain to metaphysical naturalism and all the rest. What we really want to know is whether abortion is right or wrong, and whether to legalize marijuana or euthanasia or gay marriage. And certainly such ethical matters are the more *urgent* of the two. 

But the foundations are more important. A society that agrees on fundamental rules can argue over the exact application of those rules in our own circumstances. But a society that disagrees on fundamentals needs to secure the fundament or risk the society collapsing. 

It is no good to object that discussions about virtue are base; the proper reply is that they are basic.

            <Text># Alasdair MacIntyre: Virtue in Practice 

**Introduction**

### Influence

Alasdair MacIntyre (born 1929) is an influential moral and political philosopher. His eighteen books and greater than three hundred published articles have indelibly impacted analytic ethics and several other fields. MacIntyre embodies the ideal Roy Sellars commended, that philosophers ought to be not only specialists in their own sub discipline but also informed both in the history of philosophy and in contemporary science. Refusing to restrict himself to a single topic, MacIntyre has contributed to virtue ethics, communitarianism, the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education; but he has contributed to other fields outside philosophy strictly defined, including sociology and literary analysis. Refusing to restrict himself to a strict style, his work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations, such as the memorable picture he paints of emotivism as not merely a theory of moral language but a “culture” with its own paradigmatic “characters”, the Manager and the Therapist.[@macintyre1984after chapter 3] His long career has been characterized by a long evolution within and across various schools of thought. For example, he has adjusted (and in some cases, retracted) his affiliations. He began his career as a Marxist, before “converting” to Aristotelianism, and most recently “converting” to Christianity and Thomism. He denies the labels “virtue ethicist” and “communitarian,” despite his contributions to both fields, rather preferring to be thought of simply as a ‘philosopher’ and a Thomist. But he is still writing and still thinking. Those who familiar with the expansiveness of his research will not be too quick to declare that his evolution is finished.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.] 

### Main themes

The full significance of his legacy remains to be seen, but two of his most oft-recurring thematic points have had widespread impact: the first is that ethical terms, concepts, and judgments have *a history*. We can only responsibly use or evaluate our own moral and more broadly evaluative terms, concepts, and judgments when we have some historical perspective on them. We must know ourselves as members of a “tradition”, that is, a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. The second is that moral reasoning is a species of practical reasoning *tout court*. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself. Together, these two themes have guided MacIntyre’s conclusions. 

His commitments to thinking through ethical concepts in tandem with concepts of rationality, and thinking through both in historical/traditional perspective lead him to many specific conclusions. The three that shall concern us here are these: first, that “we” (MacIntyre’s western, English-speaking or European audience) are members of the tradition of liberalism, modernity, the Enlightenment.  

His second conclusion is that, compared to the moral, social, and political unity of previous generations, modern moral philosophy since the Enlightenment has gotten off track. The last several hundred years of philosophical ethics in the west are best explained by positing a moral, social, and political disaster. Morality has become unintelligible. If morality is a set of rules, actions, or character traits that are admirable or praiseworthy, then intelligible morality cannot but exist within a nexus of two other concepts: human-nature-as-it-is (identified with help from psychology, sociology, etc.) *and* a conception of “human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-achieved-its-telos”. Our modern, liberal, Enlightenment tradition (which we shall explicate below) got off track due to the attempt to banish *telos* or intrinsic purposes from morality, rendering the virtues, moral duties, praiseworthy actions unintelligible. 

A third conclusions that will concern us in this chapter follows from the first two. The restoration of historical perspective and of thinking of ethical reasoning as a species of practical reasoning showed him that the restoration of telos, of a conception of human nature as it could be, a clear conception of the potential of human nature, would lead to a restoration of moral intelligibility and would thus promise to undergird a restoration of social and political integrity. He invites his readers, especially those who find the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition fatally flawed, to give up on its hopeless elements and restore it with the resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The promise of such a restoration and recovery is immense. If the point of education, politics, and social life were once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, these activities and pursuits would become intelligible in ways that many modern folk can hardly imagine. 

These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate (some of) them and respond to them.

But it is worth noting at the outset that these conclusions are as radical as they are popular. MacIntyre’s ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. And, to the surprise of some, his influence has been marked. Many, certainly, have declined his invitation to restore the Aristotelian tradition of virtue, but many have accepted it. Those who decline are more or less content with modern ethical and political thinking. They believe corrections and improvements are warranted but not a major overhaul; they find  MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. Those who accept his invitation tend to be more dissatisfied with the present modern culture, modern morality, and modern politics. 

The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) really is an *invitation* — it is not a *demand.* MacIntyre’s primary audience consists of those who are already discontent with modern culture and morality who may well find MacIntyre's solutions compelling. However, MacIntyre never writes in such a way as to seem to *compel* (neither by reason nor rhetoric) anyone to believe his theory. He does not force anyone to play by his rules, to accept his definitions of terms, but readers who are not discontent with modernity to self-reflect, to reflect on our common history. They may find something of interest in his criticisms. And finally, even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would something like this be a good solution?"

### Chapter outline

The chapter is divided into four sections. 

**Section 1: Tradition and history**. Section 1 sets the foundation for MacIntyre’s theory of virtue and practical wisdom that he offers as a cure for what ills modern moral philosophy. First, I shall explain MacIntyre’s assumption that we moderns — even putatively “anti-traditionalist” moderns — are part of a “tradition,” and explicate his belief that our modern tradition is fatally flawed. I will tell part of MacIntyre’s personal history, his epistemological crises, that helps make sense of his eventual theories.

**Section 2: Virtue**.  Section 2 summarizes and discusses MacIntyre’s theory of virtue as presented in his four main virtue books. I shall present his positive account of virtue in historical perspective. I shall also summarize the related supporting concepts that uphold this account of virtue: practices, the self and its narrative of human life, practical reason and human nature, telos and happiness, tradition and practical rationality. 

**Section 3: Objections**. Section 3 presents a sampling of the powerful objections critics have offered to various aspects of MacIntyre’s theory.  Also, I shall try to identify the main types of critic — crudely put, they are modernists, postmodernists, and MacIntyre’s own fellow Thomists. While it would be impossible to mention let alone do justice to the many excellent responses from MacIntyre’s sizable crowd of allies and enemies, I shall  focus on what three of what I take to be three superlatively important challenges to MacIntyre’s key concepts of virtue, tradition-constituted-rationality, and teleology. The first objection pertains to the relativism; many worry that MacIntyre has undercut any possibility of intelligibly defending the robust moral realism inherent to the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The second objection pertains to rationality and tradition (which are inextricably related in MacIntyre’s work, as we shall see); some worry that his theory of rationality is plainly incoherent, while others worry that it is coherent but that MacIntyre’s espousing of it *while* arguing his particular ethical conclusions amounts to a performative contradiction. The third objection pertains to teleology and the concept of telos; some worry that trying to shoehorn teleology back into ethics, even if it were desirable to do so, will require accepting tenets from a discredited Aristotelian metaphysics of nature; others argue that ethics can get along well enough without any need for telos. 

**Section 4: Discussion**. Section 4 discusses these objections and considers whether  MacIntyre’s virtue theory contains the resources with which to answer them satisfactorily.  While I cannot claim to finally calm the worries of his critics, I argue that each of these three objections can be answered. His notion of tradition-constituted-rationality, while frustratingly open to interpretation (by philosophers from varying traditions!) is ultimately a powerful and useful framework with which to explain the paradoxical phenomena of widespread moral disagreement *alongside* widespread moral agreement. His notion of virtue is not, at the end of the day, relativistic if by that term we mean to say that no one person’s or culture’s conception of virtue is rationally superior to any other’s. And the needed type of teleology for MacIntyre’s proposed restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue is credible within our context of modern science, so long as we carefully distinguish various possible types of ‘teleology’ (e.g., there are at least cosmic, metaphysical, biological, and social teleologies). With all that said, I shall argue that we should expect any “answer” to such fundamental worries to expose deep metaphilosophical fault lines. So, I shall caution MacIntyre’s allies and enemies to be cautious about hastily labeling each other as “unphilosophical” on the basis of an inability — at the moment — of finally adjudicating these disputes. I shall close this chapter with a reflection on why some find MacIntyre’s philosophical ethics so infuriating and easy to misunderstand. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 

## Tradition and history ##

My first goal in this chapter is to make an adequate presentation MacIntyre's account of virtue. However, it would be unwise quickly to dive in to that presentation without two preliminaries. To see why, consider two of his early (and by no means final) formulations of a definition of virtue: First, he defines virtues as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] And secondly:

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]

These formulations define virtue in terms of "practices" that an individual engages in throughout his or her "whole life", all in context of a "tradition". These three concepts -- practice, life, and tradition -- are constitutive pieces of MacIntyre's account of virtue. While discussions of *practice* and *life* can wait, I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain *tradition* at the outset. Thankfully, a brief preliminary explanation will suffice for now. More details will appear in this chapter as they are needed.

### We inhabit a tradition ###

MacIntyre maintains that every inquirer inhabits a tradition. What does this mean? First we must take the point in its least controversial and hence most trivial sense that each inquirer is an embodied human being, living in a particular time and place, speaking (and perhaps thinking) within a given language, inquiring within a particular social setting. These trivia are not very interesting yet. But they are only the beginning.  

What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222. He specifies that the content of the tradition is self-reflexive: "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition."] deriving from a source text and continuing across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Tanakh) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Tanakh and later commentaries. Augustinianism is a tradition rooted in the Holy Bible and Augustine's corpus, consisting in socially-embedded arguments over how to best interpret and apply Augustine; history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to define history, how to conduct historical enquiry. 

With all this said, MacIntyre assumes that "we" inhabit a tradition. Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism does not correlate to the contemporary political division between “conservatives” and “liberals.” Rather, liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives”.) For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

In the (1990) Gifford Lectures, MacIntyre presented three rival versions of moral inquiry as expressions of three rival traditions.[@macintyre1990three] A book was later made of these lectures. Richard Forty wrote that the book “deepens and defends MacIntyre’s claim that genuinely rational enquiry requires membership in a particular type of moral community. He offers the most persuasive recent restatement of the Thomist position on the relation of metaphysics to morality.” What are the “three rival versions”? He labels them ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and ‘tradition’. Now, the use of the single word ‘tradition’ to mean both the genus (with three species) *and* one of those three species is deadly confusing, so I propose to call the third tradition Thomism. 

The three are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. Genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Thomists use the past as a basis for building upon and yet transcending the past. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think “we have arrived.” Thomists think, in advance, that those in the future will use the present as a foundation for building upon and yet transcending the present. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, though Foucault and Derrida get honorable mention. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica* and to Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. As for the *Britannica*, one reviewer put the point this way: “The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms." For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. I was educated in a modern university on modern fare, as were my readers (I presume). So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. It has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Within modernity, we analytic philosophers have further source texts in Russell, Frege, and Wittgenstein, instigating arguments over how to best conduct philosophical enquiry, the definition of analytic philosophy, and the relationship between language and thought. These arguments take place almost exclusively in a university setting, through academic books, conferences, lectures, seminars, and journal publications rather than (as in other times) through newspapers, popular books, parliamentary debates, and so on. 

The difference between 'tradition' and neighbor concepts, such as culture, theory, institution, inquiry, and practice will, I hope, become clearer below. And a few objections to MacIntyre's allegedly vague definition will be discussed below. The reader is not yet expected to agree with such a characterization of tradition. It is sufficient, at this juncture, to grasp the point and to grant it as an axiom for what follows. 

### MacIntyre's intellectual history ###

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a living moral tradition, the Aristotelian tradition. Before I presented his account of virtue, I needed to supply at least a makeshift account of tradition. There is one other account I need to give. Even with a notion of ourselves as embodied members of a living tradition of Enlightenment modernity in hand, it would be an injustice to MacIntyre's way of presenting his theory as the fruit of his own philosophical enquiry if I did not briefly tell the story of that enquiry. 

MacIntyre's intellectual history is a story of several intellectual crises. Each crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover not just a more adequate answer to the particular intellectual problem but to reflect on methodology. 

He grew up in a "border" culture between rustic Scottish fishing villages and the elite intellectual life offered him at the independent Epsom College and by his tutor R. G. Collinwood. During his undergraduate study of the classics at Queen Mary College of the University of London, he acquired an interest in ethics. He pursued an M.A. At the University of Manchester and wrote his thesis ("*The Significance of Moral Judgments*") critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. 

From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] Many who critique the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity end up with "the masters of suspicion" who distrust thought, language, and rationality itself. MacIntyre took a surprising course. The kinds of critical analysis the "masters of suspicion" use did level to the ground much of the edifice of modernity. But rather than embracing a thorough, cynical, postmodernism of this sort, MacIntyre took to an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue, and eventually Thomism, that MacIntyre continues to build. 

One of MacIntyre's most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive. He invitation is this: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

Now, MacIntyre's image is not merely about morality as one sub-field within academic philosophy. It is about morality as part of the fabric of social and political life, part of what binds groups together, gives urgency and meaning to their joint projects, sustains consensus about civil laws by which honors and goods are distributed and criminal punishments are delivered. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any applied ethical issue you can think of such as the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation and so on. They also disagree about the background issue in resolving practical moral problems -- that is, which normative framework to use, deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism, quietism, ironic nihilism or something else entirely. Modern ethicists have sometimes taken comfort in the retreat to meta-ethics. Perhaps stepping back from sticky normative questions will permit the calm, cool, and rational resolution of some problems in moral semantics, moral metaphysics, and moral epistemology. Yet after a century of metaethics, the field has not consolidated but proliferated moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreement on the formal and material propositions under dispute. It seems that deep and abiding disagreement within normative ethics and metaethics is the defining datum of modern moral philosophy. This is the "catastrophe" MacIntyre pictures above.

Rather than despair, MacIntyre observed an analogy between morality and science that proved extremely fruitful. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences. What if a similar structure obtained in revolution between paradigms or traditions in the "moral sciences"? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. Briefly, as I read it, Kuhn's work directly confronts the widespread and naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquiry has been growing in slow and steady straight line since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. But some stagnate. A paradigm is a research program that unites many researchers with a methodology and unites their conclusions within a stable scientific system of doctrine. The encyclopedia of knowledge can be augmented or pruned, but its taxonomy stays mostly the same. A paradigm comes in for trouble when lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. If not resolved, these worries bloom into a full-blown epistemological crisis. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm becomes entrenched in the establishment. Once young, rebellious, and revolutionary, it becomes middle-aged, stable, and respectable. It is the scientific paradigm of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm. 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful." He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyerabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] The parallel between the two explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. MacIntyre’s ethical theory is both extremely cognizant of historical background and extremely cognizant of methodology; some have thought his ethics (of the good) collapses into epistemology (a means of rationally identifying the good). The thought is a mistake, but an understandable one. An understandable mistake that also happens in the philosophy of science. 

This comparison between *ethical* crises and *scientific* crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. 

MacIntyre's ethical philosophy began in crisis and despair, but did not end there. It ended, rather, in a thoroughgoing Thomism that is at once historicist and progressive, at once optimistic and anti-relativistic. Making sense of such a conclusion is not easy. But it is much easier if we are clear about where his radical critic of the modern tradition arises from, and how he aims to solve it. 

## Virtue, Practice, Tradition

I can now present MacIntyre's account of virtue.  His virtue theory is not fully supplemented until he completes the“*After Virtue* Project” consisting of *After Virtue* (1984), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988); *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990); and *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999). But the most focused presentation is *After Virtue*. We will begin there. 

In this section, I will reflect in detail on his initial definition, which he derives from a careful study of the traditions of virtue from Homer, Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragic poets, the New Testament, Aquinas, Jane Austen, and Benjamin Franklin. Then I will summarize how he expands this definition with supporting concepts such as the self (which is the bearer of individual virtue), practice (which is an activity in which virtues are needed), practical reason (which is our human nature). 

Each of these interlocking concepts build on and also support his conception of virtue. If these concepts as presented are accurate to the phenomena of human life, then each one lends support to MacIntyre’s conviction that “humans need the virtues.” 

### Virtue — a first pass

MacIntyre’s philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’ within *After Virtue*. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and concludes with his own His account is historical but not historicist; it aims for universality but is not purely abstract conceptual analysis. It is, in a word, traditional. MacIntyre’s definition emerges from history but is not restricted to its history; he does not vow to conserve. Yet it does not appear “out of heaven”, unprecedented, unpredicted, unaccountable, and ready-made. 
His first definition, as mentioned above, is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191] A few initial comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are acquired *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre later changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are *acquired* human qualities. In the first line of Plato's *Meno*, Meno asks Socrates a question that moral philosophers have continued to try to answer for the last 2,400 years. He asks "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is *acquired.* This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. In this, he agrees with Aristotle that virtue is *in accordance with* nature but not *by nature*. That is, we might say, virtues do not arise "automatically" but also are not acquired by working against the grain of our human nature. Rather, they can be seen as a "normal" psychological outgrowth of cultivating certain human practices. 

Thirdly, virtues enable their possessor to achieve particular *goods.* There are two implicit points here. Virtues by definition are beneficial. A virtuous trait *cannot* be directed at achieving ills. This point solves by definitional fiat a very vexing question that recurs often in ethical philosophy, namely, can overall vicious and wicked people have particular virtues? Can the thief be courageous, the dictator magnanimous, the glutton affable? It certainly seems that the answer is yes. I shall discuss this point a bit more under the objection of relativism. 

A second implicit point is that virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally.  A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both instrumental (to the achievement of certain goods) and also *partly constitutive of those goods.* Virtues are both means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

This worry exposes deep fault lines. For the sake of completing my presentation of virtue, I must set it aside for now. I shall return to it under the heading of the objection about teleology.  

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference goods internal to *practices*. Practice is a key term of art within MacIntyre's theory of virtue. To misunderstand 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So with these initial comments in hand, I shall more deeply explore MacIntyre's unfolding account of virtue in the following sub-sections. Each section will elaborate on one of the following key components: practice, self, and tradition. 

### Practice ###

What is a practice? A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends. Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, and political activity as examples *inter alia*. A practice is not merely a reflexive action (like scratching an itch) nor merely a single, discrete, intelligible action (like pulling a weed); it is an intelligible set of actions such as tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc., all embedded within a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is a social activity undertaken (let's say) for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

Leading MacIntyre scholar, Christopher Lutz, analyzes MacIntyre’s famous passage into the following four statements. A practice is: 

&gt;[1] a complex social activity that [2] enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. [3] Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, [3] the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.[@lutz2015] 

As this explication makes more clear, MacIntyre’s notion of virtue and practice is tied to the goods “internal to” practices. He later calls internal goods "goods of excellence" and calls external ones "goods of effectiveness.” The point here is, I think, clear. The goods internal to farming are just those that *necessarily constitute success within a given practice as it is*: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers aim to produce comestibles, but I am generalizing.) Virtues relative to the practice of farming might include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Mere efficiency in attaining such external goods does not entail the presence of a virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just a neutral desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

An illustrative example is political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the *polis*. But others (we need not speculate the proportion!) engage in order to achieve “external”, unessential, goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power. Very often we see American politicians running for office with apparently only one aim: book sales. 

As I see it, virtue defined by practice can already be significantly contrasted against mere *happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. On the one hand, the standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal formal laws. They are “contentful,” immanent, flexible standards. On the other hand, the standards by which practitioners judge each other are not all “external” ; they are not merely an arbitrary set of social conventions. Farmers cannot get together and decide farming is no longer about husbandry but is about selling land along highways for billboard advertisements. The practice itself, with its history and its aims, has a structure that is persists across generations and flexes, but does not break, with varying standards. That structure is passed along, modified, but modified according to an inner logic. Many have agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe’s characterization of consequentialism more generally that it views all consequences as “external.” She puts the point in this way: 

&gt;Now the consequentialist has no footing on which to say "This would be permissible, this not"; because by his own hypothesis, it is the consequences that are to decide, and he has no business to pretend that he can lay it down what possible twists a man could give doing this or that; the most he can say is: a man must not bring about this or that; he has no right to say he will, in an actual case, bring about such-and-such unless he does so-and-so.[@anscombe1958 13] 

I shall return to this discussion of external goods below in the teleological objection. 

The internal goal of farming is (by my hypothesis) the production of edible food; its practitioners *as farmers* are committed to this goal without any eye toward broader features of farming as a business. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. By contrast, the practice of farming demands specific virtues. A farmer must be honest in order to maintain positive relationships with various suppliers and buyers; a farmer must be courageous, willing to withstand real pain and risk possible harm for the sake of the good being pursued, in order to face unseasonable weather, illness, or other misfortune. 

### Self ###

MacIntyre's account of virtue begins in terms of practices. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. A second layer of his account in *After Virtue* defines virtues as beneficial *to* human beings, human selves.[@macintyre1984after chapter 15.] Humans perform practices; humans are the bearers of virtues and vices. What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. Drawing the contrast between MacIntyre’s view and the modern puts into clear relief the differing conceptions of the good, of nature, and of telos. 

The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast well enough to quote them in full:

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a telos, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific telos brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a telos external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. Indeed, they celebrate the empty self. The elimination of these strictures seem an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

It is difficult to understate the importance of this point about the self and its relation to not only virtue theory but ethical theory itself. Edward Oakes describes the removal of telos from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”

&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed.
&gt;This is perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy. Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of telos, restored to its proper place. In the modernist picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. My present self is a time slice of my overall total self (through time), I am able to know facts and value values, I have my own good separate and apart from your good and that of my family and community and society. In the traditional picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. In the present, I owe my being and personhood to the past (especially my family who biologically gave me being) and psychologically and culturally to my tradition. I am able to know truth, for there is only one manifold of truths. My good is that of my community; my community’s good is that of mine. These data are fundamental. 

On this issue, MacIntyre argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self.  While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a few comments are worth making to clarify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map.

Two considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

By contrast, it seems that each of us takes an identity, at least in part, from our past and from our tradition. 

### Telos and happiness ### 

For MacIntyre, the loss of telos (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But telos unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear telos is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

In the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”, the *Nicomachean Ethics*, MacIntyre finds the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The telos of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 

His provisional conception of our human telos is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human telos is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our telos consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single telos governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and telos comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our telos. 

MacIntyre says: 

&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of telos as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not a eudaimonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaimonist. He seems to be saying that our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human telos (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the telos might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our telos consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate telos of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. 

I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

Thus far, we have seen that MacIntyre presents virtues as those qualities acquired by individual selves in the performance of practices that serve the intrinsic teloi or ends of those practices. 


### An initial worry 

One worry that many readers have shared is that MacIntyre’s account of virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a “practice”? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. MacIntyre vehemently denies being a relativist and devotes the whole of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* to capturing the truth in relativity while escaping relativism.[@macintyre1984after xii-xiii in the 25th anniversary edition] 

He admits that there *might* be evil practices. (We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil.) If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. To avoid relativism, he must say something to do justice to the assumption that virtues are not neutral with respect to ends, but are actually *good* for their possessor. He must put practice into a broader teleological context and question whether life *as a whole* can be virtuous. He does say that the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] (Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition.) Even putting human life into a unified, narrative context does not ultimately solve the problem of relativism. For we still might worry: is there a single telos for human life? Is there a unity to all the virtues such that “wicked virtues” can be excluded? And if so, is it rooted in our “metaphysical biology” as Aristotle thought? 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third layer in the *After Virtue* account. His answer to this worry is, I believe, the crux of his whole theory of ethics. It appeals to two concepts that are, for him, intimately bound up with each other. The two concepts are practical reason and human nature. (In the next section, I shall show how practical rationality and tradition meld into one concept.) I shall discuss each in turn and attempt to show how they are unified in MacIntyre’s thought. 

### We are practical reasoners ###

I would like to add details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to *Whose Justice?* The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally significant as our independence, autonomy, or self-sufficiency. In other words, there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate the commonalities between us and other animals. He says: 

&gt;“I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

The point, I take it, is that we are practical reasoners. Imagine any scenario of humans gathering and doing what comes naturally, and it will involve group deliberation about what to do: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

This is the first point. The second is that our lives are not lived out as adults, but progress from young, to middle aged, to old. Regarding point (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says:  

&gt;“Virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities that are specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how and why they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9] 

How do the arguments of *After Virtue* connect to these points? We may fairly draw this connection: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and the virtues that enable them must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

Whatever definition of virtue we settle on will generate a “list” of virtues. Whatever virtues are included on the list had better not exclude virtues that make human life possible; it had better not exclude (as Aristotle did) women and manual workers from the very possibility of developing virtues. 

We can see how the structural limits on what it means to be human begin to set boundaries on our ethical theories. Empirical study cannot tell us what is good, but it can set limits on *what is not* going to be good for creatures like us. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] But our practical reasoning sets us apart in some respects. We have the burden and responsibility to set the course for our own lives, and to care for the dependent among us who are not yet practical reasoners or who are no longer such. 

The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. This makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. Vices harm the dependent and restrict them from becoming independent practical reasoners. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. Weinstein says that the primary theme of his work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre %%page number%%] In this he defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but simply is the domain of *living well*.  *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

Our human nature as dependent practical reasoners also clarifies why prudence or *phronesis* is the master virtue. It complements and completes every other moral virtue. MacIntyre defends Aristotle’s conception of the practical syllogism wherein the major premise is an evaluative judgment about a virtue or action-type; the minor premise is a truth judgment about a situation or action-token; the conclusion is *an action*. For example, “I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting a student’s attempt to bribe me for a higher grade. This student is attempting to bribe me for a higher grade. Therefore, in this case, I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting this student’s attempt to bribe me.” Without moral virtues, prudence is simply the knowledge of *what is to be done*. Without prudence, the moral virtues are simply skills or habits that might be serviceable to bad ends; one might be excellent in achieving *what is not be done*. 

The mastery of prudence over other virtues also unifies the other virtues. *Dependent Rational Animals* advances MacIntyre’s virtue theory in that it supplies a basis for the unity of intellectual and moral virtues, for the unity of the various moral virtues, and for unity of the various stages of the narrative of *human* life. The paradoxical notion of “wicked virtues” are explained only with this broad context of human life, and with this definition of human nature. As Christopher Lutz says, “The strength of MacIntyre's account of practices is that the pursuit of excellence in a practice entails the pursuit of virtue, but if practices can be evil, and virtues can "enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to” such an evil practice, and virtues can be anything at all.[@lutz2004tradition 101]

Although these responses to the initial worry about relativism may bring up more questions than they answer, they at least present a coherent picture of human life and the qualities needed to live it well. 

### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

For MacIntyre, moral enquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such enquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. 


## Objections 

MacIntyre’s work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

In the following sub-sections, I group his three types of critics. Then, I articulate and discuss key objections especially from his “encyclopedist” critics. 

The primary objection regarding virtue as he defines it relative to practices, the narrative of human life, and tradition, is the charge of relativism. This is a weighty objection and deserves almost a whole chapter in its own right. 

A related objection regarding tradition-constituted rationality charges MacIntyre with an incoherent definition of tradition; if some traditions are truly incommensurable to each other, and MacIntyre himself is truly situated within a tradition, then writing a book like *After Virtue* which is written from a universal, objective, view-from-nowhere should be impossible. Writing *After Virtue* and defending a theory of virtue amounts to a performative contradiction. 

The third objection regarding teleology and the “quest” for human happiness or fulfillment is twofold: on the one hand, it seems that modern moral philosophy can get along quite well without teleology. On the other hand, even if it couldn’t, then that seems to indict philosophical ethics entirely as unscientific, hopeless, superstition. 

I summarize the secondary literature on these points, as well as MacIntyre’s replies, and attempt to adjudicate the conflict. Finally, I shall close with a reflection on why his philosophical ethics is so liable to misunderstanding and, to some, so infuriating. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


### Relativism objections

Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted by being called 'a giant' in Lilliput but 'a midget' in Brobdingnag; the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is pejoratively called a rationalist by the fideist and a fideist by the rationalists; he is called a progressive by traditionalists and a traditionalist by progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. 

The most recurring objection to MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy is a cluster of worries about relativism. Ironically, and perhaps comfortingly, he is accused of being too relativistic and of being not being enough of a relativist. 

Briefly put, the worry is this: MacIntyre's virtue, it seems, is relative to practices, to communities, to institutions, or to “rival versions of moral enquiry” — in a word, virtue is relative to traditions. It is entirely possible for traditions to be incommensurable with each other. Hence, it is possible for conceptions of virtue to be incommensurable with each other. 

Acceptance of a tradition entails acceptance of *a* particular definition of virtue and list of virtues; denial of a tradition (or denial of *tradition itself*) entails the rejection of any definition of virtue and list of virtues. In light of this interpretation of his ethical theory, all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that group consider to be virtues, not what virtues *actually are*. The inquirer interested in, say, which tradition is *correct* or which version of moral enquiry is *correct* is at a loss. We might call this “tradition relativism”.

How do we make sense of this objection? First we have to stipulate what "relativism" is. Fully defining the constellation of (sometimes conflicting) positions that fly under that heading is no small task. Instead of attempting to adjudicate them, I shall follow Stephn Lutz: “Relativism” is a conclusion of an enquiry to the effect that there are no truths free from contingent, historical conditions of the would-be knower.[@lutz2004tradition 66] To the relativist, the knower's individual or cultural perspective is both starting point and ending point of any enquiry. 

Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] Three of these are misunderstandings, three are justifiable questions that MacIntyre's theory, fully developed, can answer, and three are legitimate observations of the limits of MacIntyre's theory. Whether the identification amounts to a "critique" depends on whether those limits are *the actual limits* on enquiry. 

I shall briefly summarize Lutz' discussion of the first six criticisms before addressing more fully the last three. 

#### Feldmen ####

That of Susan Feldman[@feldman1986objectivity] misinterprets MacIntyre’s project as a failed and incoherent attempt to resolve factious, subjective ethical disputes by judging them from an abstract, objective, ideal observer. But MacIntyre never explicitly presents his theory as an ideal observer theory; rather, he explicitly denies it. The ideal observer would have to *begin* the enquiry from the view from nowhere, which is impossible for us. MacIntyre just is not building -- not even *attempting* to build -- a procedural meta-ethics with which to adjudicate otherwise intractable normative disagreements. 


#### Wachbroit ####

A second criticism is from Robet Wachbroit.  MacIntyre himself responded to Wachbroit in the second edition of *After Virtue*.[@wachbroit1984relativism] Wachbroit's worry is about the fundamental plurality of rationalities. He thinks MacIntyre faces a dilemma. Either MacIntyre himself writes from the view from nowhere, the Enlightenment objectivity, the archimedean point, or he writes from within the Aristotelian tradition. MacIntyre seems to get caught in this dilemma in sentences like these: "It scarcely needs repeating that it is the central thesis of *After Virtue* that the Aristotelian moral tradition is the best example we possess of a tradition whose adherents are entitled to a high measure of confidence in its epistemological and moral resources."[@macintyre1984after 277] To whom does that 'we' refer? The dilemma, again, is that either 'we' are the Enlightened modern liberals or 'we' are the dyed-in-the-wool Aristotelians. On the first horn, if he writes from the view-from-nowhere, then MacIntyre is simply a modern meta-ethicist writing modern meta-ethics. He is criticizing liberalism from within the liberal tradition; he is borrowing the resources of the liberal definition of rationality to posit a theory in which no one definition of rationality has the resources to write books like *After Virtue*. On the second horn, if 'we' are card-carrying Aristotelians, it is trivial and almost tautologous to assert that 'we' take a high measure of confidence in Aristotelianism's epistemological and moral resources. Of course 'we' do! That kind of heady confidence that 'we' are up to standards arises within *each* tradition according to *that* tradition's own standards. 

Wachbroit misunderstands MacIntyre's theory ever so slightly here. MacIntyre can run through the horns of the dilemma. The 'we' need not be an ideal observer from a God's-eye point of view nor an Aristotelian already subsumed in the Aristotelian tradition. The 'we' can be those of us within broader western culture who have faced or might face the same kind of epistemological crisis that lead MacIntyre (and others) to critically evaluate the present state of western culture. The adherent of liberalism and the adherent of Aristotelianism share a common social, historical, and traditional root. Without too much difficulty, they can learn each other's conceptual vocabulary as a 'second language'. By self-reflecting upon the Enlightenment "branch" of the broader western tradition, and by facing up to its inadequacies and epistemological inconsistencies, the liberal adherent can test for him or herself whether the Aristotelian tradition has more resources for solving problems that are problems *by liberalism's own lights*. If, as MacIntyre did, such a person discovers that the Aristotelian has more resources for solving those problems, he or she might make rejoin with that older but no less thriving tradition. 

#### Colby Objection ####

Mark Colby misunderstands MacIntyre's project as an attempt to develop a new, objective criterion of truth that will solve the problem of epistemological crisis, regardless of one's tradition. On Colby's reading, MacIntyre is a kind of pragmatist, where the truth is just the conclusion of a certain sort of rational enquiry. But MacIntyre denies this. The test of a traditon's rationality is its adequation to reality. Lutz illustrates this with the example of astronomy. 

&gt; Ptolemaic astronomy lasted 1000 years because it solves a set of astronomical problems better than any of its opponents, including the heliocentric models of Aristarchus and Copernicus. Nevertheless, it did not adequately characterize the true nature of planetary motion and so under close evaluation it was plagued by inefficiencies that lead its adherents into a epistemological crisis. The theory that overcame Ptolemaic astronomy did so because it solved the astronomical problems or adequately than the Ptolemaic model, and it was confirmed by its predictive capacity. The fact that Kepler's astronomical model once subsumed into Newtonian physics, could predict novel facts provided confirmation that it was not only a clever description of a puzzling phenomenon, but a more adequate characterization of its object: the true nature of planetary motion.
&gt; what counts as progressiveness in the epistemological crisis resolution is improved adequacy to truths, but it pissed him logical crises only rise *within* traditions. Ptolemaic astronomers overcame *their* epistemological crisis when they abandoned *their own* geocentric beliefs Intertraditional considerations arise only when the adherents of one tradition are able to recongize in the resources of another tradition a more adequate solution to their own epistemological crisis. So progressiveness in epistemological crisis resolution cannot function as an intertraditional norm of rationality. This is no challenge to MacIntyre, however, because MacIntyre does not envision epistemological crisis as a tool for comparative ethics or meta-ethics.[@lutz2004tradition 91]

As I understand Lutz' point here, Colby is conflating the attempt of an inquirer *within* a tradition to resolve his or her epistemological crisis through examining the resources of a rival tradition with the attempt of an inquirier *outside* both traditions to resolve "epistemological crisis" per se by developing an intertraditional or trans-traditional criterion of adequacy. MacIntyre thinks the former is possible (and happens often) but that the latter is impossible. 

#### Roque Objection ####

Alicia Juarrero Roque surfaces another possible misinterpretation. MacIntyre claims that "comparison" between traditions is possible for an inquirer. But it is not possible by the attainment of an objective, context-free stance. Rather, each inquirier acquires a conceptual framework from his own tradition -- this is like a "first language." But each inquirer has the capacity to learn a "second first language". We can learn another conceptual framework philosophical imagination, through taking it *as if true* even before affirming it *as true*. Why do this? Usually because the inquirer's own tradition has failed him; he sees its inadequacies, he sees its problems and contradictions, he sees that it fails to live up to its own standards. MacIntyre describes what "rare gift of empathy" that this "philosophical imagination"[ makes possible: “…understand the theses, arguments, and concepts of their rival in such a way that they are able to view themselves from such an alien standpoint and to re-characterize their own beliefs in an appropriate manner from the alien perspective."[@macintyre1988whose 167]

Roque's worry is that the capacity for learning a second first language is an innate, rational capacity that *all people share.* If so, then belief in such a capacity contradicts the definition of tradition-constituted rationality. If not, then the absence of such a capacity renders tradition comparison impossible. MacIntyre's response is flatly to deny this interpretation of his work. The "capacity" to learn another tradition as a "second first language" is a "rare gift of empathy" and in no way part of a supposed bundle of innate capacities. This rebuttal does not make such a capacity unproblematic; we still might wonder whether, for an given inquirer, that inquirer's estimation that he possesses the gift of empathy and philosophical imagination isn't just a re-statement of the trivial thought, "I think I am right."


#### Evil practices ####

As we observed earlier, virtues exist only in the context of practices. Yet some practices seem to be evil. MacIntyre's earlier theory cannot overcome this objection, Lutz argues. He says:

&gt;Unfortunately, the relativism of *After Virtue* cannot be overcome unless its definitions of the virtues are extended to embrace the Aristotelian and Thomistic doctrine of the unity of virtue. Macs rejection of the unity of virtue in *After Virtue* has grave implications for the rest of his virtue theory because the rejection of the unity of virtue divroces the intellectual moral virtue of prudence from the passional moral virtues of courage, temperence, and justice... Prudence becomes cleverness. Courage and temperance are relativized, so that one could reasonable speak of the virtue of courage in a Nazi... Likewise, justice is reduced to some notion of fairness.[@lutz2004tradition 98]

There have been ethical philosophers who endorse this kind of reductive virtue. Lutz mentions Edmund Pincoff as an "emotivist virtue theorist" (using "emotivist" in the narrower, MacIntyrean sense). Lutz continues by examining the implications of such a theory. Such a move has two main effects: (1) "It constitues the rejection of the Aristotelian practical syllogism that MacIntyre wanted to recover in *After Virtue* because it separates prudent reasoning from virtuous action. (2) It evacuates all falsifiable substantive moral content from the virtues, reducing them to enabling qualities."[@lutz2004tradition 100] The commonsense definition of "virtue" includes positive valence. A virtue is, within our tradition, a quality *admirable for its own sake* or else a quality that enables its bearer to *achieve admirable goals*. If a procedure results in a definition of virtue wherein even bad qualities or even good qualities that enable any given wicked goal, then the procedure has gone awry. 


### Incoherence of the concept 'Tradition' and rationality Objection

The set of relativism objections and replies to them push us to articulate more clearly MacIntyre’s theory of rationality. Ethical reasoning is practical reasoning; and practical reason is a mode of *reasoning* per se, a mode of practical rationality in action. Living well depends on thinking well, though of course thinking well is merely necessary and not sufficient for living well. 

For this reason, the last objection Stephen Lutz discusses under the heading of “relativism” I shall discuss under the heading of “tradition-constituted rationality.” The objection is twofold: first, is MacIntyre’s concept of tradition-constituted rationality even coherent? Second, is it clear enough to be an indispensable feature of an ethical theory? 

 MacIntyre says on the one hand that, according to Tradition A, X is rational. According to Tradition B, X is not rational. They disagree and seem to genuinely disagree. A member of Tradition A can reasonably affirm that X cannot be both rational and irrational. Now, MacIntyre says that a member of Tradition B can discover some internal contradiction in Tradition B that makes her reconsider her tradition as aw hole. Perhaps she discovers that, according to Tradition B, Z is both rational and irrational. She is disconcerted by the contradiction. She decides to imaginatively entertain the possibility that Tradition A is more adequate and comes to see, over time, that Tradition A’s critique of Tradition B is compelling. The odd conclusion is this: affirming a contradiction is irrational for anyone in any Tradition. Now, I endorse this conclusion; if someone affirms a contradiction, and they persist in it in spite of repeated attempts to explain to them the contradiction, I would find them not just mistaken but fundamentally mentally impaired —  irrational. But the point is not whether the law of non-contradiction is true and a reliable criterion of rationality. The point is that MacIntyre cannot say so without contradicting himself. 

Suppose first that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational, while Tradition B teaches that logical contradictions can be rational. Then the member of Tradition B that affirms a contradiction (Z is both rational and irrational) will not, by her own standards, see a problem with her affirmation. A member of Tradition A will see the problem (by his own standards), but this is nothing surprising or new. The member of Tradition B has in principle no path out of her tradition, no motivation to see her tradition as mistaken, and hence no motivation to consider Tradition A. 

Suppose now that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational and Tradition B teaches the same. Now, according to MacIntyre, they agree (at least on this point) about a standard of rationality. They disagree about whether Z is rational or not, but they agree that Z cannot be both irrational and rational at the same time in the same respect. Are Tradition A and B now part of the same tradition, since they agree about the law of non-contradiction? Or are they different traditions, since they disagree about the rationality of Z? 



### Telos ###

A third major objection pertains to MacIntyre’s view of teleology. His whole ethical case against rival modern traditions of modernity and postmodernity is predicated on their rejection of teleology; his case for Aristotelian tradition of virtue is predicated on the recovery of telos. 

This objection takes two forms. On the one hand, it seems that morality (not to mention politics and society) can get along well without teleology. To make good on what is possible, one must simply furnish an example of what is actual. To make good on the usefulness and adequacy of a non-teleological ethics, one simply needs to furnish such an ethics. Two broad schools of thought take themselves to supply such an ethics: Kantian deontologists and consequentialists. 

For example, on the other hand, it might be objected that *some* modern ethics *are* teleological after all. For instance, it seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of telos. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). So perhaps virtue ethics can be synthesized with consequentialism. 

On the other hand, it seems that the moral law *by itself* tells us what actions are wrong or not wrong. @korsgaard1996authority argues that the autonomous moral law delivers judgments -- and generates categorical obligations -- without regard to teleology. These duties or laws are generated by our *practical identity*. That is, there are some actions that violate my practical identities. Trivially, if I call myself a baker I must bake things. If I refuse to bake I disintegrate that practical identity. Though she does not say it like this, I would state that identities are *functional concepts.* To be a farmer is in some sense to *do what farmers do*. To be a sea captain, or a teacher, or a father, is to *perform the functions* prescribed by or definitionally built into those concepts. Even if the exact limits and boundaries of a functional concept are sometimes fuzzy or flexible, they are still intelligible. Now, my first and fundamental practical identity is that of human being.[@korsgaard1996authority] I simply must value my own humanity if I am to value anything at all. And I do value things; therefore, I do value my own humanity. Anyone who values anything values their own humanity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 


## Discussion

I take it these three constellations of objections are the most telling against MacIntyre's own theory. In this section I shall attempt a rebuttal of each one. I shall close with a discussion of MacIntyre's influence and why, I think, his theories are so polarizing.

### Relativism response


Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted by being called 'a giant' in Lilliput but 'a midget' in Brobdingnag; the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is pejoratively called a rationalist by the fideist and a fideist by the rationalists; he is called a progressive by traditionalists and a traditionalist by progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. 


Now, MacIntyre denies relativism. Instead, he accepts the thesis that all of our inquiries, including our understanding of rationality itself, takes place within a cultural, historical, and traditional context. Following Lutz, we can say that MacIntyre accepts “relativity”.

Relativity (a term borrowed from Michael Krausz[@krausz1984relativism]) is a thesis about *the condition of enquiry.* It is not a thesis about the *conclusion of enquiry.* Lutz approves of Mark Colby's statement that "argumentative situatedness is inescapable."[@lutz2004tradition 89] 

Such relativity, such situatedness, is compatible with objective or absolute or mind-independent or tradition-independent *truth*. It is incompatible with an objective or absoltue or tradition-independent *rationality*. From the historically- and socially-situated position of enquiry, a philosopher (he argues) may indeed find truth. In my terms, our contingent social, cultural, and individual perspective is an alpha point of every enquiry but is not the omega point of every enquiry. 

In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, MacIntyre explicitly retracts his earlier belief that virtues exist without a unity under prudence.[@macintyre1988whose preface, p. x] The consequences of this retraction, Lutz argues, are wide-ranging and crucial to refuting the charge of relativism. If virtues are unified, then even though virtues exist only in the context of practices, "no genuine practice can be inherently evil."[@lutz2004tradition 102] Rather, practical reason can judge *apparent goods* as genuine goods. The qualities needed for achieving the spurious goods internal to that "practice" would not be virtues but only *apparent virtues*. Now, such a definition certainly seems ad hoc. But Lutz provides a persuasive illustration: eugenics. Eugenics certainly seems to bear the markings of a genuine practice. Its apparent good is the purification of the gene pool for future generations. However, genuine virtues militate *against* the achievement of that goal. For example, Lutz cites a story of a Nazi doctor who had the virtue of compassion found himself unable to pursue the program of euthanizing mentally-disabled children. Even the doctor seemed disappointed with himself, asserting that he "approve[d]" state measures with conviction" but was "too gentle for this work... Heil Hitler!"[@@poliakov1979harvest 186-7] We might also recall Huck Finn's internal struggle with his "conscience" in *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.[@twain2014adventures Chapter 31] 

Huck decides to turn Jim in to the slave owners. He writes a letter outing Jim, and feels much better after "repenting" of his theft: 

&gt;I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell...  

After vividly confronting Jim's humanity, his goodness, and their loyal friendship, he wavers. 

&gt;It was a difficult situation. I picked up the letter, and held it in my hand. I was trembling, because I knew had to make a choice between two things, and the outcome of my decision would last forever. I thought about it a minute while I held my breath. And then I said to myself: “All right, then, I’ll GO to hell"—and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

The humor of this passage arises, in large part, because of the tension between the *apparent good* of treating Jim as legal property and the *actual good* of treating Jim as an end in himself, as a free man just like any other. Huck's virtue (in this case, loyalty or friendship) *cannot* be put to use in the service of a corrupting practice like slave-trading. Just as vice subverts institutions and their worthy practices, virtue "subverts" vicious institutions and unworthy practices. Virtue marks the difference between the coward who disobeys his commanding officer's orders because the obedience would put him at risk of painful death and the courageous person who disobeys his commanding officer's order because obedience would require wrongdoing. Without prudence to discriminate between the two cases, we lack any resources by which to discriminate courage and cowardice, between a virtuous resistance and vicious resistance. 

MacIntyre's account satisfies two desideratum, which together form a paradoxical explanandum: his account explains why vices sometimes persist within pseudo-practices, institutions, and traditions from generation to generation, and it explains why practice-enabling virtues sometimes emerge to disrupt a pseudo-practice, a wicked institution, and a corrupt or at least incomplete tradition. The fact is that "many kinds of activities can be, and in fact are considered to be, practices. Some of these may conflict radically, owing to errors and insufficiences in rationlity."[@lutz2004tradition 103] Errors in rationality explain errors in traditions and hence misacriptions of the title 'virtue.' Rationality answers to truth, to the world as it is, not merely to the pragmatic reduction of truth to "dialectical success."[@lutz2004tradition 104] Hence, virtues answer to *what is really good*. They do not merely answer to "what-counts-as-good-for-us", which property is relative to each tradition. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes this iteration of the charge of relativism, while still explaining why rival traditions differ -- and sometimes radically differ -- in their evaluations and opinions. Incomplete traditions can, and do, undergo crisis. Particular persons within that tradition discover and perseverate on inadequacies within the tradition, leading to an epistemological crisis. In response, others within the same tradition may become willing to examine the resources of rival traditions and either quit their primary tradition or re-fashion it, re-make it, update it, and make real moral and intellectual progress. 

### J. L. A. Garcia ###

J. L. A. Garcia says that “MacIntyre’s rebuttal is as radical as it is ingenious. It is, in effect, to outrelativize the relativist. Rather than recoiling from relativism, as I understand his strategy, MacIntyre plunges so deeply into it, as we might say, to fall out the other side… Contrary to what he sees as the relativist’s hasty and facile assumption, MacIntyre insists that it is not necessarily (nor always) the case that everyone is so situated that there is no position whose adoption *by her* at *any* time would be rationally superiors to some particular *set* of alternatives…Now the tables are turned, and it is the relativist who appears the dogmatist, claiming to know in advance and *a priori* that no one can be so situated.” This all appears to me correct. MacIntyre uses the genealogist’s starting points to undercut the encyclopedist — a move which implicitly approves of moral relativism. But he doesn’t stop there; he uses all the resources of intellectual history and contemporary natural and social sciences to defend some (but not all) of the beliefs and values of modernity, such as the value of democracy, the value of university education, the value of history, the belief in the possibility of scientific truth, the belief in progress — a move which seems to endorse the Enlightenment and the liberal tradition as against the genealogists. To both, his challenge is to use the best resources of the past and the best rational resources of the present to defend a particular set of conclusions *as the best thus far*, as the *closest* to the truth. To both, his challenge is to defend a conception of morality and rationality *neither* claiming that any such conceptions are impossible *nor* claiming to have *concluded* the enquiry once and for all.

### Relativism Objection Conclusion ###

MacIntyre has responded to (and he thinks refuted) the charge of relativism multiple times, in his primary works and in “responses to critics.” Yet for many, relativism stains the image of MacIntyre. Even after clarifying the obscure points of the dialectic MacIntyre does endorse, the objection can be resolved but not finally refuted. I would like to offer a suggestion as to why this is so. Rather, the resolution of the criticism can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves; hence MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the enquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the enquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that enquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the enquiry. 


### Incoherence of Tradition Objection Reply

I think it true that tradition influences our standards of rationality, justice, and virtue, but demonstrably false that it *constitutes* such standards. The law of non-contradiction is the counterexample. 

Every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction; every tradition denies rational agents the right to believe (P &amp; ~P). Any tradition that denies the law of non-contradiction, it seems to me, is an irrational tradition. And I don’t just intend to say it is irrational relative to my own standards of rationality, but that it is irrational full stop and possible to “step outside” my tradition far enough to see that. If there even does exist any person (such as Nagarjuna) or community or tradition that affirms (P &amp; ~P), we ought not interpret them as having a different standard of rationality but rather we ought to interpret them as believing that rationality is an obstacle to nirvana. Affirming contradictions is still irrational, but it is the kind of irrationality needed to do violence to the limits of rationality and transcend them. 

So I think MacIntyre’s unqualified claims about tradition constituting rationality should be limited to claims about other standards for acceptable kinds of evidence, etc.


#### Clarity — the Definition of tradition ####

A different angle to the same objection is the very definition of the term ‘tradition.’ Some readers, such as John Haldane, question MacIntyre’s ability coherently to identify what a tradition is. Call this the Differentiation Problem. Are two traditions separate and hence identifiable only if they are incommensurable? How much difference constitutes separation? How much overlap is compatible with difference? Jewish and Christian traditions share a common origin and bear considerable overlap in authorities, scriptures, and doctrines. 

MacIntyre’s definition makes such teasing out difficult. He characterizes a tradition as “separate and unified when its members or texts have a core set of shared commitments to beliefs, when the tradition is situated in a particular context in a particular set of institutions and when the tradition has an identifiable linguistic difference when compared to other traditions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 83] 

The response that Weinstein gives is this. We should not expect, by MacIntyre’s lights, that there is an automatically objective, view-from-nowhere by which we can define tradition itself. Rather, MacIntyre concludes that “the concept of a tradition, together with the criteria for its use and application, is itself one developed from within one particular tradition-based standpoint. This does not preclude its application to the very tradition within which it was developed.”[@horton1994after 295] This is liable to frustrate some readers. But the alternative (by MacIntyre’s lights) is intellectual imperialism wherein one tradition has the *real* scoop on every other tradition. MacIntyre grants that his self-definition of his own tradition arises, in part, from his criteria of that tradition. Traditions change over time. They progress (according to their own unchanging standards) toward unchanging goals or else they abandon old standards. 

I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. This may not satisfy critiques but it cordons off their objections. It pushes back, to demand that the critics self-reflect and specify their own tradition (in MacIntyre’s words) even as they demand a definition of the term ‘tradition’ (in their own words). 


#### Justification of Morality Objection #### 

I would like to expand this objection by appeal to a slightly different one. I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection. He points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*, which I shall discuss in a later chapter.

// Will I discuss it in a later chapter? If not remove that sentence. 

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is this: the question “why be moral?” is never asked in the abstract. Philosophers often pose the “why be moral?” question hypothetically, as if they were skeptics of one or another sort. But such an idealized moral skeptic will not do. And a non-hypothetical, non-idealized skeptic faces a problem, on MacIntyre’s theory. 

That problem is that if they are full-fledged members of their tradition, the “why be moral?” question usually does not arise. There are two exceptions: The first when persons who succeed in sincerely asking the “why be moral?” question who are, by definition, outcasts from their own society. The emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The *polis* to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the *polis* which belongs to him. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” simply do not arise. 

In drawing the distinction between the modern "emotivist self" and the "self of the heroic age" MacIntyre says, “In heroic society there is no 'outside except that of the stranger. A man who tried to withdraw himself from his given position in heroic society would be engaged in the enterprise of trying to make himself disappear.”[@macintyre1984after 126] In one sense, MacIntyre *dissolves* this worry. His strategy is not to give the skeptical “why be moral?” question the devil’s due and solve it on its own conditions; his strategy is to undermine the conditions of asking it. 

The second exception is when moral skeptics *are* members of their own tradition but are seeing the problems within their own tradition and are troubled by a “border tradition”. This skeptic sees the resources of a rival tradition and compares such favorably with the resources of his own tradition. He is, in a word, entering epistemological crisis. And to such a skeptic, MacIntyre’s theory invites him or her to do the hard work of resolving that crisis by examining, from within the context of a primary tradition *and* a “second first” tradition, the problems at hand and the available solutions, working toward an ever greater understanding of the truth. 

For this reason, again, I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. 

### Telos reply 

On the other hand, however, these modern moralities are either covertly teleological or they are incoherent. 

First, as MacIntyre has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without telos becomes unintelligible. A society that highly values some virtue (say, chastity) but does so only out of habit --  without any wisp of certain knowledge about the effect chastity has on a man or woman's whole life --  will not long retain that high opinion. Chastity as a white-knuckle fiat not to engage in sexual intercourse with anyone other than one's opposite-sex spouse is simply too difficult, psychologically and morally, to seem valuable to someone who has no clue why chastity is so good for us, and why sexual license is so disastrous for humans, families, and societies. 

### Telos and virtue (and life, and self) are an organic whole ##

If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover telos. That is, we must discover or re-discover the organic holism of the narrative unity of my life, my identity and self-concept, the telos of human life as a species and my own specific telos as a member of that species, and the virtues that are the qualities that enable me to achieve my telos. Not one of these parts can be left out of the whole. 

The second option is that teleology is smuggled in. Charles Taylor argues this point persuasively.[@taylor] We do not need to take the point on authority. We can rediscover it ourselves rather quickly. 

As a sample for review, examine Kantian deontology and its base-line foundation: Kant famously pronounced: "Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of it, which can be called good, without qualification, except a good will."[@kantgroundwork] This is the first principle of Kantianism: the categorical imperative, the value of humanity, the value of autonomy, the identification of a will that obeys the categorical imperative with 'the good will'.  The good will is good because it follows the good law; the law of autonomy (all other laws being heteronomous); the categorical imperative is the unconditional obligation on all practically rational beings whatsoever to treat other rational beings as ends in themselves, others being equally autonomous, others being equally human and therefore equally valuable. This is all very consistent. 

But why are humans valuable? Kant can give no answer to this. It is his own emotive assertion. 

Take any other modern moral philosophy such as Humean sentimentalism, utilitarian consequentialism, psychological egoism or contractarianism. Consider its base-line foundation, its summum bonum, its first principle, its Great Platitude, and you will discover the same baseless base, the same groundless assumption. 

For Humean sentimentalism the first principle is the relation between the good and my affections. "To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to feel a satisfaction of particular kind from the contemplation of a character." (*Treatise of Human Nature* 471)

For contractarianism it is the value of keeping promises. "The moral theory of contractarianism claims that moral norms derive their normative force from the idea of contract or mutual agreement." But such a value is a western prejudice.

&gt;Contracts require independent agents who are able to make and carry out promises without the aid of others. Historically, while white men have been treated as these pure wills of contract theory, Blacks and women have been treated as anti-will: dependent and irrational. Both ideals are false; whole people, she says, are dependent on other whole people. But by defining some as contractors and others as incapable of contract, whole classes of people can be excluded from the realm of justice. This point has been explored by other critics of contractarianism, first by Allen Buchanan (1993) and more recently by Eva Kittay (1999), who points out that not only are dependents such as children and disabled people left out of consideration by contractarian theories, but their caretakers' needs and interests will tend to be underestimated in the contract, as well.[@sepcontractarianism]

For consequentialism it is the value of happiness or pleasure. All that Mill can say to the inquirer who wants to hear about *why* happiness is desirable is that people desire it.

&gt;It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?
&gt;Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfill -- to make good its claim to be believed?
&gt;The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.[@mill chapter 4, "Of what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible"]

This kind of hand-waving does not inspire the confidence of eudaimonist virtue theorists who think that the "proof" of the principle of eudaimonia is "susceptible" of something much more robust. 

Reply to Objection 1. Korsgaard's point here is not far off from MacIntyre's (nor, I assume, far from Sandel's or any other communitarian's). Her thesis is that a moral identity qua practical identity is fundamental and supports other practical identities (like son, brother, citizen, teacher). Insofar as human nature is a real thing, MacIntyre can agree that humanity is a functional concept. If I am to be human, there are some deeds I must do. MacIntyre (and, I presume, other communitarians) would simply query whether I can discover my identity qua human before discovering it qua American or member of the Buhler family or "westerner". What is deepest metaphysically is last epistemologically. MacIntyre might argue that Korsgaard cannot discover her identity qua human without her western education, without reading Kant, without the benefit of being a part of the Enlightenment tradition. Korsgaard takes for granted her identity as a westerner and falsely construes that particular identity -- invisible to her -- as *the* universal human identity. Would Christine Korsgaard, the particular human being, have the same belief about human identity if she were raised not in the U. S. but in the E. U. or the U. A. E. in a different moral tradition? 

Reply to Objection 2. Consequences may be "external" or "internal." That is, consequences of an action may be non-natural or natural. The oxygenation of the blood is a natural consequence of breathing. Our biological make-up determines that the act of breathing and the oxygenation of the blood an organic whole. A natural consequence of holding your breath is a build up of carbon dioxide. Winning a world record for holding your breath underwater is a non-natural consequence of holding your breath. Consequentialists either do not distinguish between the two or are explicit that there are no ends or consequences related internally or naturally with some means. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;But before proceeding to this discussion I propose, first, to deal with the third kind of ethical question—the question: What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalization. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. Good effects Moore argues are aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships. Strangely enough, the same Moore defines the necessary relation between parts and a whole as an "organic whole" or "organic unity." But he sees no organic unity between (some) means and their ends. Some means are partially constitutive of their ends. We might say that the *means* and the *end* form in that instance an organic whole. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constitutive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species gorilla gorilla as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics. 

The problem here is inconsistency and self-deception. The modern tradition, the “traditionless-tradition” either helps itself to Aristotelian telos while vehemently denying it, or (if honest) collapses into the “truthless-tradition” of postmodernity. 

#### Ends/means Objection. ####

I said above that the refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. Charles Taylor endorses the notion that “the place accorded the virtues [is] a kind of litmus test for discriminating Aristotelian from modern ethical theory.”[@taylor 25]

What could this mean? Behind the means/end distinction is a peculiarly modern assumption that formal and final causes are either not related or not *necessarily* related. There are various ways of cashing out this distinction. In biology, it is the distinction between form and function.[@huneman2006naturalising] In engineering it is the distinction between design and operation.



### Even if there were no natural teloi, human action is teleological

MacIntyre has a powerful response to this objection. It is, I think, satisfying. And that is that the conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology can be side-stepped. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups (the Republican or Democratic Party, the YMCA, the U.S.A., the Parent Teacher Association, Starbucks) is end-directed actions and practices. That is enough. Call it "social teleology." 

Christine Korsgaard has defended the notion of practical reason as the faculty we discover in ourselves *after* we are already acting in the world and reflecting upon our actions.[@korsgaard1996authority] It is not really up for debate that we are reflective creatures; everyone reading this is capable of reflecting on their actions, asking for and providing *reasons* for action that may or may not justify the action. This is close, I think, to MacIntyre's way of thinking. 

Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. Telos can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With telos firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether telos exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

### Human action is teleological

One thesis I would like to extract, develop, and defend is this: human practices are necessarily end-directed (teleological). “Social teleology” has at least two and possibly three aspects: individual, collective, and human. The first aspect of social teleology is the end-directed behavior of each agent; the second is the end-directed behavior of social groups, like families, nations, clubs, congregations, and so on. The third, and most objectionable, aspect, is the end-directed activity of our species as a whole. What, if anything, does every human being intentionally pursue? 

The answer to this question is bound to be controversial. But before we try to answer it we can pause and point out that MacIntyre has made the question intelligible and urgent. 

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. And if it is correct, it demands the re-evaluation of some cherished assumptions. 

In sum, the rebuttal of the “no need for teleology” objection is twofold: first, if the sort of teleology needed is merely social or anthropological, then that sort of teleology is defensible. Secondly, the alternative — a purely formal ethics allegedly sanitized from notions of final causation, intrinsic ends, natural purposes — is not actually an alternative to teleological ethics because it turns out to be covertly teleological in the end. 

If these rebuttals are in the right vein, then one of MacIntyre’s key points from *After Virtue*, *Whose Justice?*, and *Dependent Rational Animals* emerges as a shining light. That is, human life is teleological, and so the attempt to construct anti-teleological systems is impossible and the endeavor to conduct ourselves according to anti-teleological ethics is futile. 

Such a conclusion may be taken as quite dire. Or it may be invigorate optimism. Ethics, reinvigorated with teleology, might just be able to escape some of its modern quandaries. And not only ethics. Law, political philosophy, and applied disciplines like politics itself, rhetoric and debate, social philosophy, and others disciplines are given new promise and new hope. 


## Conclusion

### Theorist of Rationality ###

MacIntyre is a theorist of rationality (and of practical rationality and hence virtue). Hence rationally to assess his theory requires thinking through our own theory of rationality. But thinking about rationality is thinking through our own thinking. The errors we make in thinking are likely to be underscored by our attempts to *think them through*. The Greek proverb is: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” If something is deeply wrong with the way we think, how can theorizing about rationality right the wrong? The Latin proverb (from a very different context) is “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” — who will guard the guards themselves? I believe the answer to the rhetorical question is no one at all can guard the guards. If water chokes us, there is nothing we can do to wash it down and clear our throat. Similarly, some of the errors MacIntyre diagnoses in thinkers who belong to the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition will be invisible to those thinkers. 

Even if MacIntyre’s diagnosis is *correct*, especially if it is correct, the patient will find the diagnosis unintelligible, even irrational. Insofar as the patient finds any parts of his theory intelligible, they will seem radical, disastrous in their social implications, and destructive of the very nature and purpose of education. The reason these appearances will be insuperable to MacIntyre’s patient is because the patient is, by his lights, self-deceived. He or she simply denies being part of a tradition, and hence denies having a particular (rather than universal) tradition-bound conception of rationality, and hence denies having a particular, tradition-bound conception of the good (perhaps the good is unbounded freedom to follow the moral law, or to pursue happiness,, and justice unfettered equality). Modernity is the “tradition-less tradition” and hence *must* deny tradition to be consistent with itself. 

But *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and others are directed toward the discontented liberal modern. This patient comes to MacIntyre with manifesting symptoms. MacIntyre offers one possible diagnosis, and the patient’s job is to investigate further. The patient needs philosophical imagination to even *consider* the possibility of another truth. The patient needs patience, intellectual courage, and self-reflection. The patient needs to sit in front of the proverbial mirror and mouth the words, (a) “I am part of a tradition” and (b) “my tradition might be inadequate,” and (c) “that other tradition might have the resources more adequately to address the intellectual and practical problems that I now see are insuperable to my tradition.” 

It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

Nevertheless, some (like Nagel) are surprised and perhaps even offended when the religious philosopher (like MacIntyre) concludes upon decades of reflection that his secular colleague is less than rational. No! Nagel protests, the religious philosophers is less than rational — my secularism is by definition an allegiance to rationality over dogma. But Lutz rightly disentangles this web of definitional fiat and counter-fiat. If Nagel’s secularism is a dogma, and one unsustainable after decades of the most open-minded reflection upon best evidence, then the secular philosopher is not just mistaken but irrational. If this result seems surprising to the reader, it is a likely sign that MacIntyre’s theory has not yet been grasped. 

Nagel’s inability or unwillingness to consider that his secularism is a dogma or ideology would put disadvantage him relative to MacIntyre. For Nagel’s part, he *does* self-reflectively consider it, but does not express the further willingness to imaginatively and philosophically entertain the opposing tradition’s account. 

Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side just isn’t doing philosophy anymore. My only point here is that which side it is is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal, secular philosophers that MacIntyerean-type “philosophy” just isn’t.  It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian, religious philosophers that Nagalean “philosophy” just isn’t. 

### MacIntyre’s Greatness

Great thinkers — Plato, Aquinas, Kant — have a distinguishing feature of presenting a totalizing theory that not only explains a whole host of phenomena and solves problems, but explain why critics criticize. Great thinkers present not only philosophical solutions to philosophical problems, but a definition or understanding of philosophy itself. They are always philosophers *and* metaphilosophers. 

One of the features so satisfying to adherents of Plato, Aquinas, Kant (I could have mentioned a dozen others) is that their totalizing theory puts agreement in context and puts disagreement with the theory in context. It casts critics in a particular light. This is satisfying to adherents but infuriating to critics. 

One of the signs, I believe, of MacIntyre’s greatness is just this feature. He presents not only isolated theories but a theoretical system in which critics, depending on their criticism, receive a name, a number, a category, a classification, and a designated response. Adherents, too, are accommodated. But to criticize MacIntyre is much trickier business than one might suspect at first. Critics find themselves dipping into one of many already well-poisoned wells, and falling into pre-laid traps. The critic who would escape the battery is more likely to flee rather than engage; but the critic who would escape by engaging and overcoming is liable to meet her match. 

Again, while this may be infuriating, it is a sign of greatness. 

### Concluding remarks 

MacIntyre’s work is difficult to pick apart and summarize or critique in fragments. The compressions of his orchestral arguments in this chapter are inevitably going to leave some readers dissatisfied, perhaps even dismayed, by what (I have made it appear that) he is saying. Readers are of course invited to revisit the source. 

But if my summaries have captured with any accuracy the outline’s of MacIntyre’s contribution to virtue ethics, then we can say a few things with some confidence: virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. 

Differing traditions explain differing accounts of virtue. Though MacIntyre’s career began in straightforward engagement in dialectical disputes about philosophical ethics, it turned a corner when he thought to treat ethical disagreement in a manner analogous to the way Kuhn treated scientific disagreement. The result of turning this corner — MacIntyre’s own paradigm shift — was an account wherein he argues (similarly to some postmodern philosophers) that malleable traditions define standards of rationality, justice, and virtue. But he also argues, to the chagrin of postmodernists, that traditions are answerable to the world, and can be falsified.  He argues that a thoroughgoing cultural relativism (or “tradition-relativism”?) is inadequate. Such a theory holds the promise to explain why various cultures disagree about what qualities are virtues (humility or pride? acquisitiveness or contentment?) and why the same culture disagrees over time with itself about what exactly defines a particular virtue (is chastity moderation of sexual pleasure or just abstinence?) 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


Now, MacIntyre later changed his mind about the "metaphysical biology" objection. He later thought that it could be answered a second time, even more strongly. It is not just *social teleology* that necessarily exists as part of our human nature; teleology is in some sense part of non-human nature as well. He came to accept the Thomistic and ultimately Aristotelian argument that natural causes include both efficient/material causes and formal/final. He, along with many others, came to believe that modern science has succeeded *in part because of* an enduring belief in final causation or natural teleology, not because of a rejection. The story about scientists dispensing with final causes in biology and astronomy and chemistry is largely a myth. Scientists and philosophers of science abound who can give empirical and rational grounds for thinking nature is riddled with final causation. 

MacIntyre's *ethical* case does not depend on this more robust account of natural teleology. All it needs is social teleology. But if it turned out that social teleology was in *instance* of natural teleology -- that the ends of human nature were a type of the ends of nature per se -- then the framework in which virtues enable the achievement of human ends would certainly be given additional credibility. 

Making the case on behalf of natural teleology I shall not do here. That is a task for the next chapter. </Text>

            <Text># Alasdair MacIntyre: Virtue in Practice 

### Introduction ###

Alasdair MacIntyre (born 1929) is an influential moral and political philosopher. His eighteen books and greater than three hundred published articles have indelibly impacted analytic ethics and several other fields. MacIntyre embodies the ideal Roy Sellars commended, that philosophers “should be well-grounded both in the history of philosophy and in the sciences, and that the philosopher should engage philosophically with the major moral, social, and political issues of the day.”[@mcdonoughroy] Refusing to restrict himself to a single topic, MacIntyre has contributed to virtue ethics, communitarianism, the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education; but he has contributed to other fields outside philosophy strictly defined, including sociology and literary analysis. Refusing to restrict himself to a strict style, his work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations, such as the memorable picture he paints of emotivism as not merely a theory of moral language but a “culture” with its own paradigmatic “characters”, the Manager and the Therapist.[@macintyre1984after chapter 3] His long career has been characterized by a long evolution within and across various schools of thought. For example, he has adjusted (and in some cases, retracted) his affiliations. He began his career as a Marxist, before “converting” to Aristotelianism, and most recently “converting” to Christianity and Thomism. He denies the labels “virtue ethicist” and “communitarian,” despite his contributions to both fields, rather preferring to be thought of simply as a ‘philosopher’ and a Thomist. But he is still writing and still thinking. Those who familiar with the expansiveness of his research will not be too quick to declare that his evolution is finished.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.] 

### Two main themes: history and practical reason

The full significance of his legacy remains to be seen, but two of his most oft-recurring thematic points have had widespread impact: the first is that ethical terms, concepts, and judgments have *a history*. We can only responsibly use or evaluate our own moral and more broadly evaluative terms, concepts, and judgments when we have some historical perspective on them. We must know ourselves as members of a “tradition”, that is, a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. The second is that moral reasoning is a species of practical reasoning *tout court*. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself. Together, these two themes have guided MacIntyre’s conclusions. 

His commitments to thinking through ethical concepts in tandem with concepts of rationality, and thinking through both in historical/traditional perspective lead him to many specific conclusions. The three that shall concern us here are these: first, that “we” (MacIntyre’s western, English-speaking or European audience) are members of the tradition of liberalism, modernity, the Enlightenment.  

His second conclusion is that, compared to the moral, social, and political unity of previous generations, modern moral philosophy since the Enlightenment has gotten off track. The last several hundred years of philosophical ethics in the west are best explained by positing a moral, social, and political disaster. Morality has become unintelligible. If morality is a set of rules, actions, or character traits that are admirable or praiseworthy, then intelligible morality cannot but exist within a nexus of two other concepts: human-nature-as-it-is (identified with help from psychology, sociology, etc.) *and* a conception of “human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-achieved-its-telos”. Our modern, liberal, Enlightenment tradition (which we shall explicate below) got off track due to the attempt to banish *telos* or intrinsic purposes from morality, rendering the virtues, moral duties, praiseworthy actions unintelligible. 

A third conclusions that will concern us in this chapter follows from the first two. The restoration of historical perspective and of thinking of ethical reasoning as a species of practical reasoning showed him that the restoration of telos, of a conception of human nature as it could be, a clear conception of the potential of human nature, would lead to a restoration of moral intelligibility and would thus promise to undergird a restoration of social and political integrity. He invites his readers, especially those who find the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition fatally flawed, to give up on its hopeless elements and restore it with the resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The promise of such a restoration and recovery is immense. If the point of education, politics, and social life were once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, these activities and pursuits would become intelligible in ways that many modern folk can hardly imagine. 

These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate (some of) them and respond to them.

But it is worth noting at the outset that these conclusions are as radical as they are popular. MacIntyre’s ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. And, to the surprise of some, his influence has been marked. 
Those who accept his invitation tend to be more dissatisfied with the present modern culture, modern morality, and modern politics. Such may find his solutions compelling. However, MacIntyre never writes in such a way as to seem to *compel* (neither by reason nor rhetoric) anyone to believe his theory. 

The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) really is an *invitation* — it is not a *demand.*  He does not *force* anyone to play by his rules, to accept his definitions of terms. Many have declined his invitation to restore the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Those who decline tend to be more or less content with modern ethical and political thinking as it is. The changes they want to make are corrections and improvements, sometimes extensive changes, but nothing approaching an overhaul. Therefore, they tend to find  MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites readers who are not discontent with modernity to self-reflect and to reflect on our common history. They may find something of interest in his criticisms. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would something like this be a good solution?"

### Chapter outline

This chapter is divided into four sections. 

**Section 1: Tradition and history**. Section 1 sets the foundation for MacIntyre’s theory of virtue and practical wisdom that he offers as a cure for what ills modern moral philosophy. First, I shall explain MacIntyre’s assumption that we moderns — even putatively “anti-traditionalist” moderns — are part of a “tradition,” and explicate his belief that our modern tradition is fatally flawed. I will tell part of MacIntyre’s personal history, his epistemological crises, that helps make sense of his eventual theories.

**Section 2: Virtue**.  Section 2 summarizes and discusses MacIntyre’s theory of virtue as presented in his four main virtue books. I shall present his positive account of virtue in historical perspective. I shall also summarize the related supporting concepts that uphold this account of virtue: practices, the self and its narrative of human life, practical reason and human nature, *telos* and happiness, tradition and practical rationality. 

**Section 3: Objections**. Section 3 presents a sampling of the powerful objections critics have offered to various aspects of MacIntyre’s theory.  Also, I shall try to identify the main types of critic — crudely put, they are modernists, postmodernists, and MacIntyre’s own fellow Thomists. While it would be impossible to mention let alone do justice to the many excellent responses from MacIntyre’s sizable crowd of allies and enemies, I shall  focus on what three of what I take to be three superlatively important challenges to MacIntyre’s key concepts of virtue, tradition-constituted-rationality, and teleology. The first objection pertains to the relativism; many worry that MacIntyre has undercut any possibility of intelligibly defending the robust moral realism inherent to the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The second objection pertains to rationality and tradition (which are inextricably related in MacIntyre’s work, as we shall see); some worry that his theory of rationality is plainly incoherent, while others worry that it is coherent but that MacIntyre’s espousing of it *while* arguing his particular ethical conclusions amounts to a performative contradiction. The third objection pertains to teleology and the concept of telos; some worry that trying to shoehorn teleology back into ethics, even if it were desirable to do so, will require accepting tenets from a discredited Aristotelian metaphysics of nature; others argue that ethics can get along well enough without any need for telos. 

**Section 4: Discussion**. Section 4 discusses these objections and considers whether  MacIntyre’s virtue theory contains the resources with which to answer them satisfactorily.  While I cannot claim to finally calm the worries of his critics, I argue that each of these three objections can be answered. His notion of tradition-constituted-rationality, while frustratingly open to interpretation (by philosophers from varying traditions!) is ultimately a powerful and useful framework with which to explain the paradoxical phenomena of widespread moral disagreement *alongside* widespread moral agreement. His notion of virtue is not, at the end of the day, relativistic if by that term we mean to say that no one person’s or culture’s conception of virtue is rationally superior to any other’s. And the needed type of teleology for MacIntyre’s proposed restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue is credible within our context of modern science, so long as we carefully distinguish various possible types of ‘teleology’ (e.g., there are at least cosmic, metaphysical, biological, and social teleologies). With all that said, I shall argue that we should expect any “answer” to such fundamental worries to expose deep metaphilosophical fault lines. So, I shall caution MacIntyre’s allies and enemies to be cautious about hastily labeling each other as “unphilosophical” on the basis of an inability — at the moment — of finally adjudicating these disputes. I shall close this chapter with a reflection on why some find MacIntyre’s philosophical ethics so infuriating and easy to misunderstand. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 

## Tradition and history ##

My first goal in this chapter is to make an adequate presentation MacIntyre's account of virtue. However, it would be unwise quickly to dive in to that presentation without two preliminaries. To see why, consider two of his early (and by no means final) formulations of a definition of virtue: First, he defines virtues as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] And secondly:

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]

These formulations define virtue in terms of "practices" that an individual engages in throughout his or her "whole life", all in context of a "tradition". These three concepts -- practice, life, and tradition -- are constitutive pieces of MacIntyre's account of virtue. While discussions of *practice* and *life* can wait, I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain *tradition* at the outset. Thankfully, a brief preliminary explanation will suffice for now. More details will emerge as they are needed.

### We inhabit a tradition ###

MacIntyre maintains that every inquirer inhabits a tradition. What does this mean? First we must take the point in its least controversial and hence most trivial sense that each inquirer is an embodied human being, living in a particular time and place, speaking (and perhaps thinking) within a given language, inquiring within a particular social setting. These trivia are not very interesting yet. But they are only the beginning.  

What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222. He specifies that the content of the tradition is self-reflexive: "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition."] deriving from a source text and continuing across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Tanakh) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Tanakh and later commentaries. Augustinianism is a tradition rooted in the Holy Bible and Augustine's corpus, consisting in socially-embedded arguments over how to best interpret and apply Augustine; history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to define history, how to conduct historical enquiry. 

With all this said, MacIntyre assumes that "we" inhabit a tradition. Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism does not correlate to the contemporary political division between “conservatives” and “liberals.” Rather, liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives”.) For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

In the (1990) Gifford Lectures, MacIntyre presented three rival versions of moral inquiry as expressions of three rival traditions.[@macintyre1990three] A book was later made of these lectures. Richard Forty wrote that the book “deepens and defends MacIntyre’s claim that genuinely rational enquiry requires membership in a particular type of moral community. He offers the most persuasive recent restatement of the Thomist position on the relation of metaphysics to morality.” What are the “three rival versions”? He labels them ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and ‘tradition’. Now, the use of the single word ‘tradition’ to mean both the genus (with three species) *and* one of those three species is deadly confusing, so I propose to call the third tradition Thomism. 

The three are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. Genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Thomists use the past as a basis for building upon and yet transcending the past. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think “we have arrived.” Thomists think, in advance, that those in the future will use the present as a foundation for building upon and yet transcending the present. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, though Foucault and Derrida get honorable mention. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica* and to Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. As for the *Britannica*, one reviewer put the point this way: “The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms." For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. I was educated in a modern university on modern fare, as were my readers (I presume). So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. It has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Within modernity, we analytic philosophers have further source texts in Russell, Frege, and Wittgenstein, instigating arguments over how to best conduct philosophical enquiry, the definition of analytic philosophy, and the relationship between language and thought. These arguments take place almost exclusively in a university setting, through academic books, conferences, lectures, seminars, and journal publications rather than (as in other times) through newspapers, popular books, parliamentary debates, and so on. 

The difference between 'tradition' and neighbor concepts, such as culture, theory, institution, inquiry, and practice will, I hope, become clearer below. And a few objections to MacIntyre's allegedly vague definition will be discussed below. The reader is not yet expected to agree with such a characterization of tradition. It is sufficient, at this juncture, to grasp the point and to grant it as an axiom for what follows. 

### MacIntyre's intellectual history ###

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a living moral tradition, the Aristotelian tradition. Before I presented his account of virtue, I needed to supply at least a makeshift account of tradition. There is one other account I need to give. Even with a notion of ourselves as embodied members of a living tradition of Enlightenment modernity in hand, it would be an injustice to MacIntyre's way of presenting his theory as the fruit of his own philosophical enquiry if I did not briefly tell the story of that enquiry. 

MacIntyre's intellectual history is a story of several intellectual crises. Each crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover not just a more adequate answer to the particular intellectual problem but to reflect on methodology. 

He grew up in a "border" culture between rustic Scottish fishing villages and the elite intellectual life offered him at the independent Epsom College and by his tutor R. G. Collinwood. During his undergraduate study of the classics at Queen Mary College of the University of London, he acquired an interest in ethics. He pursued an M.A. At the University of Manchester and wrote his thesis ("*The Significance of Moral Judgments*") critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. 

From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] Many who critique the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity end up with "the masters of suspicion" who distrust thought, language, and rationality itself. MacIntyre took a surprising course. The kinds of critical analysis the "masters of suspicion" use did level to the ground much of the edifice of modernity. But rather than embracing a thorough, cynical, postmodernism of this sort, MacIntyre took to an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue, and eventually Thomism, that MacIntyre continues to build. 

One of MacIntyre's most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive. He invitation is this: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

Now, MacIntyre's image is not merely about morality as one sub-field within academic philosophy. It is about morality as part of the fabric of social and political life, part of what binds groups together, gives urgency and meaning to their joint projects, sustains consensus about civil laws by which honors and goods are distributed and criminal punishments are delivered. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any applied ethical issue you can think of such as the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation and so on. They also disagree about the background issue in resolving practical moral problems -- that is, which normative framework to use, deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism, quietism, ironic nihilism or something else entirely. Modern ethicists have sometimes taken comfort in the retreat to meta-ethics. Perhaps stepping back from sticky normative questions will permit the calm, cool, and rational resolution of some problems in moral semantics, moral metaphysics, and moral epistemology. Yet after a century of metaethics, the field has not consolidated but proliferated moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreement on the formal and material propositions under dispute. It seems that deep and abiding disagreement within normative ethics and metaethics is the defining datum of modern moral philosophy. This is the "catastrophe" MacIntyre pictures above.

Rather than despair, MacIntyre observed an analogy between morality and science that proved extremely fruitful. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences. What if a similar structure obtained in revolution between paradigms or traditions in the "moral sciences"? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. Briefly, as I read it, Kuhn's work directly confronts the widespread and naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquiry has been growing in slow and steady straight line since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. But some stagnate. A paradigm is a research program that unites many researchers with a methodology and unites their conclusions within a stable scientific system of doctrine. The encyclopedia of knowledge can be augmented or pruned, but its taxonomy stays mostly the same. A paradigm comes in for trouble when lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. If not resolved, these worries bloom into a full-blown epistemological crisis. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm becomes entrenched in the establishment. Once young, rebellious, and revolutionary, it becomes middle-aged, stable, and respectable. It is the scientific paradigm of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm. 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful." He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyerabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] The parallel between the two explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. MacIntyre’s ethical theory is both extremely cognizant of historical background and extremely cognizant of methodology; some have thought his ethics (of the good) collapses into epistemology (a means of rationally identifying the good). The thought is a mistake, but an understandable one. An understandable mistake that also happens in the philosophy of science. 

This comparison between *ethical* crises and *scientific* crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. 

MacIntyre's ethical philosophy began in crisis and despair, but did not end there. It ended, rather, in a thoroughgoing Thomism that is at once historicist and progressive, at once optimistic and anti-relativistic. Making sense of such a conclusion is not easy. But it is much easier if we are clear about where his radical critic of the modern tradition arises from, and how he aims to solve it. 

## Virtue, Practice, Tradition

I can now present MacIntyre's account of virtue.  His virtue theory is not fully supplemented until he completes the“*After Virtue* Project” consisting of *After Virtue* (1984), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988); *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990); and *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999). But the most focused presentation is *After Virtue*. We will begin there. 

In this section, I will reflect in detail on his initial definition, which he derives from a careful study of the traditions of virtue from Homer, Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragic poets, the New Testament, Aquinas, Jane Austen, and Benjamin Franklin. Then I will summarize how he expands this definition with supporting concepts such as the self (which is the bearer of individual virtue), practice (which is an activity in which virtues are needed), practical reason (which is our human nature). 

Each of these interlocking concepts build on and also support his conception of virtue. If these concepts as presented are accurate to the phenomena of human life, then each one lends support to MacIntyre’s conviction that “humans need the virtues.” 

### Virtue — a first pass

MacIntyre’s philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’ within *After Virtue*. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and concludes with his own His account is historical but not historicist; it aims for universality but is not purely abstract conceptual analysis. It is, in a word, traditional. MacIntyre’s definition emerges from history but is not restricted to its history; he does not vow to conserve. Yet it does not appear “out of heaven”, unprecedented, unpredicted, unaccountable, and ready-made. 
His first definition, as mentioned above, is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191] A few initial comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are acquired *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre later changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are *acquired* human qualities. In the first line of Plato's *Meno*, Meno asks Socrates a question that moral philosophers have continued to try to answer for the last 2,400 years. He asks "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is *acquired.* This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. In this, he agrees with Aristotle that virtue is *in accordance with* nature but not *by nature*. That is, we might say, virtues do not arise "automatically" but also are not acquired by working against the grain of our human nature. Rather, they can be seen as a "normal" psychological outgrowth of cultivating certain human practices. 

Thirdly, virtues enable their possessor to achieve particular *goods.* There are two implicit points here. Virtues by definition are beneficial. A virtuous trait *cannot* be directed at achieving ills. This point solves by definitional fiat a very vexing question that recurs often in ethical philosophy, namely, can overall vicious and wicked people have particular virtues? Can the thief be courageous, the dictator magnanimous, the glutton affable? It certainly seems that the answer is yes. I shall discuss this point a bit more under the objection of relativism. 

A second implicit point is that virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally.  A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both instrumental (to the achievement of certain goods) and also *partly constitutive of those goods.* Virtues are both means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

This worry exposes deep fault lines. For the sake of completing my presentation of virtue, I must set it aside for now. I shall return to it under the heading of the objection about teleology.  

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference goods internal to *practices*. Practice is a key term of art within MacIntyre's theory of virtue. To misunderstand 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So with these initial comments in hand, I shall more deeply explore MacIntyre's unfolding account of virtue in the following sub-sections. Each section will elaborate on one of the following key components: practice, self, and tradition. 

### Practice ###

What is a practice? A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends. Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, and political activity as examples *inter alia*. A practice is not merely a reflexive action (like scratching an itch) nor merely a single, discrete, intelligible action (like pulling a weed); it is an intelligible set of actions such as tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc., all embedded within a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is a social activity undertaken (let's say) for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

Leading MacIntyre scholar, Christopher Lutz, analyzes MacIntyre’s famous passage into the following four statements. A practice is: 

&gt;[1] a complex social activity that [2] enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. [3] Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, [3] the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.[@lutz2015] 

As this explication makes more clear, MacIntyre’s notion of virtue and practice is tied to the goods “internal to” practices. He later calls internal goods "goods of excellence" and calls external ones "goods of effectiveness.” The point here is, I think, clear. The goods internal to farming are just those that *necessarily constitute success within a given practice as it is*: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers aim to produce comestibles, but I am generalizing.) Virtues relative to the practice of farming might include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Mere efficiency in attaining such external goods does not entail the presence of a virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just a neutral desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

An illustrative example is political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the *polis*. But others (we need not speculate the proportion!) engage in order to achieve “external”, unessential, goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power. Very often we see American politicians running for office with apparently only one aim: book sales. 

As I see it, virtue defined by practice can already be significantly contrasted against mere *happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. On the one hand, the standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal formal laws. They are “contentful,” immanent, flexible standards. On the other hand, the standards by which practitioners judge each other are not all “external” ; they are not merely an arbitrary set of social conventions. Farmers cannot get together and decide farming is no longer about husbandry but is about selling land along highways for billboard advertisements. The practice itself, with its history and its aims, has a structure that is persists across generations and flexes, but does not break, with varying standards. That structure is passed along, modified, but modified according to an inner logic. Many have agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe’s characterization of consequentialism more generally that it views all consequences as “external.” She puts the point in this way: 

&gt;Now the consequentialist has no footing on which to say "This would be permissible, this not"; because by his own hypothesis, it is the consequences that are to decide, and he has no business to pretend that he can lay it down what possible twists a man could give doing this or that; the most he can say is: a man must not bring about this or that; he has no right to say he will, in an actual case, bring about such-and-such unless he does so-and-so.[@anscombe1958 13] 

I shall return to this discussion of external goods below in the teleological objection. 

The internal goal of farming is (by my hypothesis) the production of edible food; its practitioners *as farmers* are committed to this goal without any eye toward broader features of farming as a business. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. By contrast, the practice of farming demands specific virtues. A farmer must be honest in order to maintain positive relationships with various suppliers and buyers; a farmer must be courageous, willing to withstand real pain and risk possible harm for the sake of the good being pursued, in order to face unseasonable weather, illness, or other misfortune. 

### Self ###

MacIntyre's account of virtue begins in terms of practices. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. A second layer of his account in *After Virtue* defines virtues as beneficial *to* human beings, human selves.[@macintyre1984after chapter 15.] Humans perform practices; humans are the bearers of virtues and vices. What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. Drawing the contrast between MacIntyre’s view and the modern puts into clear relief the differing conceptions of the good, of nature, and of telos. 

The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast well enough to quote them in full:

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a telos, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific *telos* brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a *telos* external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. Indeed, they celebrate the empty self. The elimination of these strictures seem an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

It is difficult to understate the importance of this point about the self and its relation to not only virtue theory but ethical theory itself. Edward Oakes describes the removal of *telos* from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”

&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed.
&gt;This is perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy. Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of telos, restored to its proper place. In the modernist picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. My present self is a time slice of my overall total self (through time), I am able to know facts and value values, I have my own good separate and apart from your good and that of my family and community and society. In the traditional picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. In the present, I owe my being and personhood to the past (especially my family who biologically gave me being) and psychologically and culturally to my tradition. I am able to know truth, for there is only one manifold of truths. My good is that of my community; my community’s good is that of mine. These data are fundamental. 

On this issue, MacIntyre argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self.  While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a few comments are worth making to clarify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map.

Two considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

By contrast, it seems that each of us takes an identity, at least in part, from our past and from our tradition. 

### *Telos* and happiness ### 

For MacIntyre, the loss of *telos* (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But *telos* unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear *telos* is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

In the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”, the *Nicomachean Ethics*, MacIntyre finds the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The *telos* of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 

His provisional conception of our human *telos* is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our *telos* is to be free to pursue our telos. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human *telos* is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single *telos* governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and *telos* comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our telos. 

MacIntyre says: 

&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of *telos* as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not a eudaimonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaimonist. He seems to be saying that our *telos* is to be free to pursue our telos. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human *telos* (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the *telos* might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate *telos* of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. 

I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

Thus far, we have seen that MacIntyre presents virtues as those qualities acquired by individual selves in the performance of practices that serve the intrinsic teloi or ends of those practices. 


### An initial worry 

One worry that many readers have shared is that MacIntyre’s account of virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a “practice”? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. MacIntyre vehemently denies being a relativist and devotes the whole of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* to capturing the truth in relativity while escaping relativism.[@macintyre1984after xii-xiii in the 25th anniversary edition] 

He admits that there *might* be evil practices. (We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil.) If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. To avoid relativism, he must say something to do justice to the assumption that virtues are not neutral with respect to ends, but are actually *good* for their possessor. He must put practice into a broader teleological context and question whether life *as a whole* can be virtuous. He does say that the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] (Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition.) Even putting human life into a unified, narrative context does not ultimately solve the problem of relativism. For we still might worry: is there a single *telos* for human life? Is there a unity to all the virtues such that “wicked virtues” can be excluded? And if so, is it rooted in our “metaphysical biology” as Aristotle thought? 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third layer in the *After Virtue* account. His answer to this worry is, I believe, the crux of his whole theory of ethics. It appeals to two concepts that are, for him, intimately bound up with each other. The two concepts are practical reason and human nature. (In the next section, I shall show how practical rationality and tradition meld into one concept.) I shall discuss each in turn and attempt to show how they are unified in MacIntyre’s thought. 

### We are practical reasoners ###

I would like to add details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to *Whose Justice?* The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally significant as our independence, autonomy, or self-sufficiency. In other words, there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate the commonalities between us and other animals. He says: 

&gt;“I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

The point, I take it, is that we are practical reasoners. Imagine any scenario of humans gathering and doing what comes naturally, and it will involve group deliberation about what to do: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

This is the first point. The second is that our lives are not lived out as adults, but progress from young, to middle aged, to old. Regarding point (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says:  

&gt;“Virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities that are specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how and why they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9] 

How do the arguments of *After Virtue* connect to these points? We may fairly draw this connection: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and the virtues that enable them must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

Whatever definition of virtue we settle on will generate a “list” of virtues. Whatever virtues are included on the list had better not exclude virtues that make human life possible; it had better not exclude (as Aristotle did) women and manual workers from the very possibility of developing virtues. 

We can see how the structural limits on what it means to be human begin to set boundaries on our ethical theories. Empirical study cannot tell us what is good, but it can set limits on *what is not* going to be good for creatures like us. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] But our practical reasoning sets us apart in some respects. We have the burden and responsibility to set the course for our own lives, and to care for the dependent among us who are not yet practical reasoners or who are no longer such. 

The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. This makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. Vices harm the dependent and restrict them from becoming independent practical reasoners. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. Weinstein says that the primary theme of his work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre %%page number%%] In this he defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but simply is the domain of *living well*.  *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

Our human nature as dependent practical reasoners also clarifies why prudence or *phronesis* is the master virtue. It complements and completes every other moral virtue. MacIntyre defends Aristotle’s conception of the practical syllogism wherein the major premise is an evaluative judgment about a virtue or action-type; the minor premise is a truth judgment about a situation or action-token; the conclusion is *an action*. For example, “I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting a student’s attempt to bribe me for a higher grade. This student is attempting to bribe me for a higher grade. Therefore, in this case, I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting this student’s attempt to bribe me.” Without moral virtues, prudence is simply the knowledge of *what is to be done*. Without prudence, the moral virtues are simply skills or habits that might be serviceable to bad ends; one might be excellent in achieving *what is not be done*. 

The mastery of prudence over other virtues also unifies the other virtues. *Dependent Rational Animals* advances MacIntyre’s virtue theory in that it supplies a basis for the unity of intellectual and moral virtues, for the unity of the various moral virtues, and for unity of the various stages of the narrative of *human* life. The paradoxical notion of “wicked virtues” are explained only with this broad context of human life, and with this definition of human nature. As Christopher Lutz says, “The strength of MacIntyre's account of practices is that the pursuit of excellence in a practice entails the pursuit of virtue, but if practices can be evil, and virtues can "enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to” such an evil practice, and virtues can be anything at all.[@lutz2004tradition 101]

Although these responses to the initial worry about relativism may bring up more questions than they answer, they at least present a coherent picture of human life and the qualities needed to live it well. 

### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

For MacIntyre, moral enquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such enquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. 


## Objections 

MacIntyre’s work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

In the following sub-sections, I group his three types of critics. Then, I articulate and discuss key objections especially from his “encyclopedist” critics. 

The primary objection regarding virtue as he defines it relative to practices, the narrative of human life, and tradition, is the charge of relativism. This is a weighty objection and deserves almost a whole chapter in its own right. 

A related objection regarding tradition-constituted rationality charges MacIntyre with an incoherent definition of tradition; if some traditions are truly incommensurable to each other, and MacIntyre himself is truly situated within a tradition, then writing a book like *After Virtue* which is written from a universal, objective, view-from-nowhere should be impossible. Writing *After Virtue* and defending a theory of virtue amounts to a performative contradiction. 

The third objection regarding teleology and the “quest” for human happiness or fulfillment is twofold: on the one hand, it seems that modern moral philosophy can get along quite well without teleology. On the other hand, even if it couldn’t, then that seems to indict philosophical ethics entirely as unscientific, hopeless, superstition. 

I summarize the secondary literature on these points, as well as MacIntyre’s replies, and attempt to adjudicate the conflict. Finally, I shall close with a reflection on why his philosophical ethics is so liable to misunderstanding and, to some, so infuriating. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


### Three types of critic

I think it also helpful to group the *types* of critic before stating the *critiques*. The three rival versions of moral enquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. His first group of critics are “traditionalists”,  fellow Thomists or others within the broader Aristotelian tradition. For instance, Robert P. George and John Haldane ostensibly share but also dispute his Thomism. (Since I am not a Thomist and do not have a dog in that fight, I shall not dig deeply into these worries.)

A second group of postmodern philosophers are “genealogists.” Such readers agree with his critique of modernity but reject his solution. They agree that our choice is between “Nietzsche or Aristotle” but choose Nietzsche over Aristotle. Some encyclopedists have even argued (as a critique) that MacIntyre’s philosophy leads to Nietzscheanism. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

But I think to concede this is to give up on ethics as philosophy -- and perhaps to give up on philosophy as a whole. If it were true, I would have to stop writing now. 

The third group of critics are modern philosophers that are (by MacIntyre’s lights) “encyclopedists.” They belong to the tradition of modernity. Such readers (including Martha Nussbaum and Thomas Nagel) find MacIntyre’s diagnosis misguided and so find his solutions needless and radical. In their critiques, they object to the historical grouping of all “modern moral philosophies” together and to the quite despairing treatment of them. They deny that our choice is *either* “Nietzsche or Aristotle.  They defend some form of modern moral philosophy against the debunking arguments MacIntyre somewhat shares with postmodern philosophers. Their biggest worry is relativism about rationality, both theoretical and moral. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, non-perspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality.  Although MacIntyre is a successful analytic philosopher, most of his influence has not come from within analytic ethics. (I treat 'success' as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) I think his fellows have been tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy.[@hauerwas2007 put it this way: A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."] Some have suggested that his theory amounts to an abandonment of philosophy in favor of religion. For now, I would caution against this interpretation. Instead, for those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to reflect upon one’s own tradition, and to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are historically extended arguments.

### Relativism objections

The most recurring objection to MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy is a cluster of worries about relativism. How do we make sense of this objection? We have to stipulate what relativism is. The constellation of (sometimes conflicting) positions that fly under heading of 'relativism' is no small task. Instead of attempting to sift them, I shall follow Stephn Lutz: “Relativism” is a thesis about the conclusion of enquiries; every would-be knower wants truth, but is limited by its contingent, historical conditions and/or the perspective of the enquirer. Hence no conclusion is *true* in the sense the enquirer wanted.[@lutz2004tradition 66] To the relativist, the knower's individual or cultural perspective is both starting point and ending point of any enquiry. 

In MacIntyre's terms, virtue, it seems, is relative to practices, to communities, to institutions, or to rival traditions of moral enquiry. Acceptance of a tradition entails acceptance of *a* particular definition of virtue and list of virtues; denial of a tradition (or denial of *tradition itself*) entails the rejection of any definition of virtue and list of virtues. He maintains that it is possible and common for traditions to be incommensurable with each other. So conceptions of virtue can be incommensurable with each other. In light of this interpretation of his ethical theory, all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that tradition consider to be virtues, not what virtues *actually are*. The inquirer interested in, say, which tradition is *correct* or which version of moral enquiry is *correct* is at a loss. 

Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] Of these, three are simply misunderstandings, three legitimate calls for clarification, and three put real pressure on the limits of MacIntyre’s theory. Whether the pressures ultimately amounts to an objection depends on whether the limits of the theory correspond to the *the actual limits* on enquiry. While I cannot summarize all nine of these objections, in the next section I shall discuss five of those I take to be most cutting. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality objections ###

The set of relativism objections pushes MacIntyre (and us) to articulate more clearly the supporting theory of practical rationality. For MacIntyre, ethical reasoning *just is* practical reasoning; practical reasoning is a mode of *reasoning* per se. This move does not erase a worry relativistic morality; it passes the buck to relativistic rationality. The apparent incommensurability of moralities -- including varying conceptions of virtue -- passes the buck to varying conceptions of rationality. For this reason, Stephen Lutz' last objection pertaining to relativism I categorize as an objection pertaining “tradition-constituted rationality.” The objection is threefold: is MacIntyre’s concept of tradition-constituted rationality even coherent? If so, is it clear enough to be an indispensable feature of an ethical theory? If so, then how can MacIntyre avoid the charge of relativism at this level? 

Here is a reason to think his tradition-constituted theory of rationality is incoherent. Varying traditions can disagree about a proposition P. Perhaps tradition A finds P true and B finds it false, on best evidence and sufficient reflection. But incommensurable traditions disagree about the standards (say, S1 and S2) by which to judge the truth and even the rationality of other traditions. So A finds P true and rational (by S1) while B finds P false and irrational (by S2). They genuinely disagree. And A judges B to be irrational (since they deny that P) while B returns the favor (since A affirms that P). 

According to MacIntyre's account of how members of a tradition undergo epistemological crisis and begin to examine the resources of rival traditions, we tell a little story of Annabelle. Annabelle is member of tradition A discovers problems with her own tradition. Let's imagine that P entails both (Q and ~Q). She cannot deny P nor can she affirm the contradiction. (Suppose that by A's standards of rationality, S1 contradictory propositions cannot both be true in the same sense.) After some searching about, she concludes she cannot solve the problem and cannot even discover the rational resources with which to solve them. Being passingly familiar with tradition B, she becomes curious why her friends who belong to that tradition deny P and exercises her philosophical imagination to begin to see B "from within." Tradition B is compelling, since it denies that P. She "converts" traditions. However, there is a problem with tradition B, and that is that the standard of rationality of B (S2) allows its adherents to affirm a contradiction. So now, even though Annabelle left A to avoid having to affirm a contradiction (by her standard of rationality S1) now that she has joined B she no longer sees it as irrational to affirm the contradiction (by her new standard of rationality S2). This is surely an odd conclusion. 

A second variation on the same problem is this: how would a born-and-raised member of tradition B, affirming S2, ever come to epistemological crisis? Discontentment with contradictions is not available to B members *ex hypothesi*. They do not see affirming a contradiction as irrational. Their tradition can bear a hundred instances of (Q and ~Q).

The odd conclusion of this thought experiment is a dilemma: either such nonsense is possible, or embracing the law of non-contradiction is a universal standard of rationality in every tradition. The latter option seems to indicate that traditions A and B are *not* actually incommensurable, since they share one rather substantial presupposition. The flow of members from one to the other is intelligible. The former option allows A and B to be incommensurable, but seems to freeze members in their own tradition. Members of A would have no (rational) justification for joining B, while members of B would have no (rational) justification for leaving B. 

### *Telos* ###

The third and final major objection I shall consider pertains to teleology. I hope my summary above was adequate to demonstrate MacIntyre's case for rejecting the modern encyclopedist tradition and for returning, instead, to the Aristotelian tradition is predicated on the importance of retaining *telos* and the disastrous consequences of excising *telos* from our understanding of ourselves, our practices, our lives, and our traditions. 

This objection is so powerful, and the prejudices and misconceptions surrounding teleology so thick, I shall need more than one chapter to fully respond to it. I think an adequate response can be made. But philosophers' opposition to some forms of teleology is visceral opposition. It will take some philosophical digging around in the structural foundations of our thinking to make progress.  

Notwithstanding the general difficulty of this objection, in this chapter I shall present two initial forms that are especially problematic for MacIntyre's narrative. MacIntyre has it that modern moral philosophy surgically excised *telos* from natural science, psychology, and ethics. So the first form is this objection is to deny that narrative. Perhaps modern moral philosophy is not so anti-teleological as all that. Kant's categorical imperative, much vaunted for its austere duty for the sake of duty, is actually aimed at perfection.[@ward1971kant] Keith Ward argued with some impatience almost 40 years ago (10 years before *After Virtue*'s first edition) that Kant should not be interpreted as commending duty as some abstract, context-free obligation. He says: 

&gt;Kant's position is not merely that one must conceive oneself as setting up a purposive order of Nature, according to universal laws, as though one could arbitrarily choose anything whatsoever as one's purpose. One can see this if one takes Kant's list of examples of moral duties in the *Metaphysic of Morals* [sic]. Masturbation is against the *purposes of Nature*, in forming the sexual organs; suicide contravenes *Nature's purpose* in establishing self-love in order to preserve life... Finally, "holiness of will" must be pursued, as this expresses the absolute worth of the human person, in its freedom from sensuous impulses and its transcendence of Nature.[@ward1971kant 341] 

A second iteration of the same objection in its first form is that it seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of telos. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). So perhaps virtue ethics can be synthesized with consequentialism. 

Furthermore, Cummiskey has argued that Kant can be understood as a consequentialist of sorts.[@cummiskey1996kantian] The proposal is that Kant's *justification* for moral normative principles was a brute, formal, categorical imperative, but the *content* of such normative principles included agents and the goods they aim to attain. Happiness can be valued as an imperfect duty, though rational agency must be valued as a perfect duty. Without entering into all the interesting details at this juncture, the thought is that perhaps a (thoroughly modern) moral philosophy like deontology can be synthesized with natural teleology. 

A second form of this objection about teleology is that ethics can get along well enough without intrinsic *teloi* guiding or forming the natural end of our actions. </Text>

            <Title>Telos</Title>
            <Text>
*Telos* is of course Greek for "end", though the word is bursting with dizzying array of possible meanings, including "definite point", "goal", "purpose," "cessation," "order," "prize," "highest point", "realization", "decision", and "services."[@liddell1896intermediate compare with Strong's 5056: "telos tel'-os from a primary tello (to set out for a definite point or goal); properly, the point aimed at as a limit, i.e. (by implication) the conclusion of an act or state (termination (literally, figuratively or indefinitely), result (immediate, ultimate or prophetic), purpose); specially, an impost or levy (as paid); continual, custom, end(-ing), finally, uttermost."]

For the remainder of this section, I shall use the term 'end-directed' to describe the behavior of individuals and systems instead of exclusively using '*telos*'' or 'teleology'. 'End-directed' is passive voice and so seems to me neutral with respect to *intentional* versus *non-intentional* movement, and neutral with respect to whether *purposeful* end or some other kind of natural, necessary, or luck-based end. 

There are at least two kinds of teleology we can distinguish between: social (or intentional) and natural (or unintentional).[@barham2011] We can divide up each kind into sub-kinds as follows:

1. Natural teleology (organs, limbs) - eyes, hearts, bacterial flagella are end-directed; 
2. Natural teleology (whole organisms) - individual organisms are end-directed; 
3. Social teleology (individual) - human rational agency is essentially end-directed;
4. Social teleology (group) - social groups engage in intentional end-directed behavior;

Hearts pump blood; flagella move bacteria; eyes see. That is, eyes are *supposed to* see; they are "designed" to see. At least they manifest the appearance of design. They were "naturally preserved" because they see. All of these statements ascribe a end-directed behavior to organs. 

To ascribe "purposes" to, say, bacteria seems silly. However, to ascribe to bacteria natural end-directed behavior -- namely chemotaxis.[@barham2011 18] As James Barham explains, chemotaxis is the process by which a bacterium pursues and dallies in favorable environments and "flees" unfavorable ones. Empirical observation is enough to illuminate that (normal, non-defective) bacteria direct themselves toward the end of survival. 

Purposeful, intentional, end-directed behavior seems an ineliminably *mental* activity. To ascribe to a human being purposes held "before the mind" is anything but silly; it is a reality with which we are acquianted almost every waking moment of our lives. But we have individual purposes and group purposes. The end-directed behavior of a football team is to win, to score more points; the end-directed behavior of each player is different -- one is to run the ball, the other to block, the other to intercept the ball, etc. The goal of the team, we might say, supervenes on the goals of the individual players. Similarly, the goal of a community (say, a church or a university) is distinct from the goals of the individual members of that community. 

We should mention for the sake of thoroughness a possible sixth kind of natural teleology. Call it "Cosmic teleology" -- the grand system of all systems. Some thinkers (especially religious thinkers) have thought that all of the cosmos displays a kind of end-directed behavior. On this view, the individual actions of organisms on earth, the cosmic radiation of the stars in our galaxy, the almost infinitely complex relations of gravity and radiation between our galaxy and others, all work together in a kind of symphonic activity with its own, supervenient *telos*. While it is hard to imagine such an end-directed activity without an intelligent being to guide the process, not *all* those who endorse this kind of "cosmic teleology" were theists. Fate, chance, or simply the concatenation of natural laws might be posited to explain how and why everything is going a particular direction. Thomas Nagel, for example, posits (atheistic) natural teleological laws to explain the evolution of the cosmos from non-mental to mental.[@nagel2012mind]</Text>

            <Title>### The Great Platitudes </Title>
            <Text>### The Great Platitudes

Some ethical propositions are thought to be self-evidently true: it is good to be good. This is a tautology. And most (if not all) tautologies are trivial.  Other ethical propositions are not tautologous but are so widely and commonly accepted as to be easily mistaken for tautologies: it is good to be kind; cruelty is bad. Pleasure is good. Wise people make good leaders. I ought to keep my promises.  A just society is desirable. Fools are ridiculous and the wise are admirable. “Do good and avoid evil” (called the first principles of practical reason). Moderation is good (called the foundation of all ethics). “Drunkenness” or alcoholism are shameful. The Golden Rule (called the only objective rule in both religious and atheistic moralities). Injustice is bad. We ought to care for children and respect elders. Generosity is admirable. 

Of course, if we define “kindness” simply as “a good disposition to treat others well” then it appears that “it is good to be kind” amounts to the same tautologous proposition “it is good to be good.” But kindness is *not* best defined simply as *something good*. Kindness, it seems to me, and to many others upon reflection, is a special sort of quality we can recognize and name but not ultimately define. Cruelty, likewise, we “know it when we see it.” There is more to our recognition of cruelty than the arbitrary application of “a bad disposition to hurt others.” We know that children who tortures animals for fun is acting cruelly. We try to help him or her to satisfy curiosity or get parental attention through other means. We help them stop nursing a disposition to cruelty. 

These ethical propositions do not seem to me tautologies. Call these non-tautologous but basic ethical propositions Platitudes. Some Platitudes are small, others great. “It is polite to say please” is a Platitude. But “Treat others as you would wish to be treated” is a Great Platitude. 

Some philosophers take their task to be to debunk the Great Platitudes. They wish to explain them away, to explain *why* they are false and *how so many people fall in for them*. The platitudes are either *false* (“know your place” taken as a justification of socio-economic or gender inequality is false) or as trivial; *of course* “murder is unjust” is true because, ‘murder’ is defined as ‘unjust killing.’ 

Other philosophers take their task to be to *underwrite* the great platitudes. They wish to explain them, to explain why they are true and how it is we learn them, preserve them, and (most crucially) live well by taking them as sound practical advice. Both philosophers are sophisticated; but one is sophisticated in attacking and explaining away the Great Platitudes while the other is sophisticated in defending and explaining them. 

As examples of the Debunkers, consider J. L. Mackie and Alan Gibbard. Mackie claims to be running counter to the great tradition of European moral philosophy.[@mackie] Gibbard’s metaethical works aim to capture our common sense belief that morality is objective but without the Platonism. He says, "It might be thought ordinary conceptions of rationality Platonistic or intuitionistic. On the Platonistic Picture coma among the facts of the world are facts of what is rational and what is not. A person of normal mental powers can discern these facts. Judgments of nationality are thus straightforward apprehensions of fact, not through sense perception through a mental faculty analogous to sense perception..."[@gibbard1992wise 155]

As examples of Defenders, consider G. E. Moore, Robert Adams, and Frank Jackson. Moore’s grandiloquent denouncements of moral philosophy are not, as one might expect, the harbingers of a revolutionary transvaluation of values; by the end of *Principia Ethica* he has given a sophisticated 300 page articulation of the yawningly common judgment that beauty, friendship, and knowledge are goods. Robert Adams’ metaethical work aims to capture the common sense belief that morality is objective… by providing a systematic defense of Platonism. Plato sees goodness as becoming like god: “Fleeing [evil] is becoming like god so far as one can, and to become like god is to become just and pious with wisdom.[@plato *Statesman* 176a5-b2; @armstrong2004after] And Adams defends this resemblance relation as well. But not all Defenders are non-naturalists. Frank Jackson’s influential account of functionalism[@jackson1998metaphysics] aims to naturalize “mature folk morality” without necessarily invalidating all of it. 

It does no good to object that the Great Platitudes are *evil* or *oppressive*, binding women to social subjugation or condemning the poor to poverty. Rather, the corrections to the errors of European (and more broadly, western) moral philosophy are contained *within the resources* of western moral philosophy. “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” tells more powerfully against sexism or classism than any revolutionary ideal. 

### Defense of the Cutting Edge, Defense of the Foundation ###

Virtue ethics is a powerful and useful theory. Its critics offer objections to the central truth claims virtue ethicists make. Responses to critics can take of of two common forms: clarify defend these central truth claims or challenge the presuppositions of the objection. 

It might be objected by some that philosophical ethics is (or ought to be) about controversies. We don’t want urgently to know about what moral terms mean, what the concept of a moral fact is, whether moral facts exist, whether virtue talk is ineliminable from ethics, what qualities count as virtues, how virtues pertain to metaphysical naturalism and all the rest. What we really want to know is whether abortion is right or wrong, and whether to legalize marijuana or euthanasia or gay marriage. And certainly such ethical matters are the more *urgent* of the two. 

But the foundations are more important. Not because they are novel but because they are so widely known. Kant says: “But who would think of introducing a new principle of all morality and making himself as it were the first discoverer of it, just as if all the world before him were ignorant what duty was or had been in thorough-going error?”[@kantpracticalreason, preface] A society that agrees on fundamental rules can argue over the exact application of those rules in our own circumstances. But a society that disagrees on fundamentals needs to secure the fundament or risk the society collapsing. 


It is no good to object that discussions about virtue are base; the proper reply is that they are basic. To illustrate: A former student once asked me how I decided to become a teacher. I once asked if former teacher, whether I should go to grad school. There are at least two kinds of questions like these regarding how to live one's life. The first question is the kind of question the reflects on what one is already doing, what. One already feels confident about. The second question is the kind of question that reflects on what one is about to do, what one feels unsure about.  It is possible to feel confidence, but to inquire into the origin and justification of that confidence.   There are at least two kinds of questions in philosophical ethics. 

The first is to inquire into great attitudes that we are confident are true, and useful guides in living in world life. The second is to inquire into difficult, and controversy or undecided questions. As an example of the first, the value of virtue ethics is, I believe, this type. As an example of the second, consider various questions in biomedical research and trans humanism. Can we ethically experiment on Vertebrates?  What, if any, are the limits on augmenting are natural abilities with technology?

            <Text># Alasdair MacIntyre: Virtue in Practice 

### Introduction ###

Alasdair MacIntyre (born 1929) is an influential moral and political philosopher. His eighteen books and greater than three hundred published articles have indelibly impacted analytic ethics and several other fields. MacIntyre embodies the ideal Roy Sellars commended, that philosophers “should be well-grounded both in the history of philosophy and in the sciences, and that the philosopher should engage philosophically with the major moral, social, and political issues of the day.”[@mcdonoughroy] Refusing to restrict himself to a single topic, MacIntyre has contributed to virtue ethics, communitarianism, the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education; but he has contributed to other fields outside philosophy strictly defined, including sociology and literary analysis. Refusing to restrict himself to a strict style, his work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations, such as the memorable picture he paints of emotivism as not merely a theory of moral language but a “culture” with its own paradigmatic “characters”, the Manager and the Therapist.[@macintyre1984after chapter 3] His long career has been characterized by a long evolution within and across various schools of thought. He has adjusted (and in some cases, retracted) his affiliations. For example, he began his career as a Marxist, before “converting” to Aristotelianism, and most recently “converting” to Christianity and Thomism. He denies the labels “virtue ethicist” and “communitarian,” despite his contributions to both fields, rather preferring to be thought of simply as a ‘philosopher’ and a Thomist. But he is still writing and still thinking. Those who familiar with the expansiveness of his research will not be too quick to declare that his evolution is finished.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.] 

### Two main themes: history and practical reason

The full significance of his legacy remains to be seen. I shall offer some tentative predictions at the end of this chapter. Yet two of his most oft-recurring thematic points have had widespread impact: the first is that ethical terms, concepts, and judgments have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical (and more broadly, evaluative) terms, concepts, and judgments when we have some historical perspective on them. We must know ourselves as members of a “tradition”, that is, a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. A second thematic point is that moral reasoning is a species of practical reasoning *tout court*. That is, moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself. Together, these two themes have guided MacIntyre’s conclusions. 

His commitments to thinking through ethical concepts in tandem with concepts of rationality, and thinking through both in historical/traditional perspective lead him to endorse a set of specific conclusions. Three of those conclusions will be our theme in this chapter. 

I would like to give a cursory statement the primary conclusions under discussion. The first is that we are members of the tradition of liberalism, modernity, the Enlightenment. That slippery word 'we' should be taken, here, to refer to MacIntyre’s western, English-speaking or European readers.

His second conclusion is that modern moral philosophy since the Enlightenment has gotten off track. Compared to the moral, social, and political unity of previous generations or of other cultures in our own time, the last several hundred years of modernity in the west have been a mix of good and bad, but the bad has been disastruous. In fact, philosophical ethics have become unintelligible. If morality is a set of rules, actions, or character traits that are admirable or praiseworthy, then intelligible morality cannot but exist within a nexus of two other concepts: human-nature-as-it-is (identified with help from psychology, sociology, etc.) *and* a conception of “human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-achieved-its-telos”. Our modern, liberal, Enlightenment tradition (which we shall explicate below) got off track, largely due to the attempt to banish *telos* or intrinsic purposes from morality. Opposition to teleology has rendered the virtues, moral duties, praiseworthy actions unintelligible. MacIntyre invites his readers, especially those who already, for independent reasons, find the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition fatally flawed, to give up on its hopeless elements. 

A third conclusion follows from the first two. The restoration of historical perspective and of thinking of ethical reasoning as a species of practical reasoning promises that the restoration of *telos* might make available resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The promise of such a restoration and recovery is immense. A conception of human nature as it is combined with a clear conception of the potential of human nature would lead to a restoration of moral intelligibility.  The restoration of *telos* would make morality intelligible again, which would undergird a restoration of social and political integrity. If the point of education, politics, and social life were once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, these activities and pursuits would become intelligible in ways that many modern folk can hardly imagine. 

These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.

But it is worth noting at the outset that these conclusions are as radical as they are popular. MacIntyre’s ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. And, to the surprise of some, his influence has been marked. 
Those who accept his invitation tend to be more dissatisfied with the present modern culture, modern morality, and modern politics. Such may find his solutions compelling. However, MacIntyre never writes in such a way as to seem to *compel* (neither by reason nor rhetoric) anyone to believe his theory. 

The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) really is an *invitation* — it is not a *demand.*  He does not *force* anyone to play by his rules, to accept his definitions of terms. Many have declined his invitation to restore the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Those who decline tend to be more or less content with modern ethical and political thinking as it is. The changes they want to make are corrections and improvements, sometimes extensive changes, but nothing approaching an overhaul. Therefore, they tend to find  MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites readers who are not discontent with modernity to self-reflect and to reflect on our common history. They may find something of interest in his criticisms. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would something like this be a good solution?"

### Chapter outline

The labor of this chapter is divided into four sections. 

**Section 1: Tradition and history**. Section 1 sets the foundation for MacIntyre’s theory of virtue and practical wisdom that he offers as a cure for what ills modern moral philosophy. First, I shall explain MacIntyre’s assumption that we moderns — even putatively “anti-traditionalist” moderns — are part of a “tradition,” and explicate his belief that our modern tradition is fatally flawed. I will tell part of MacIntyre’s personal history, his epistemological crises, that helps make sense of his eventual theories.

**Section 2: Virtue**.  Section 2 summarizes and discusses MacIntyre’s theory of virtue as presented in his four main virtue books. I shall present his positive account of virtue in historical perspective. I shall also summarize the related supporting concepts that uphold this account of virtue: practices, the self and its narrative of human life, practical reason and human nature, *telos* and happiness, tradition and practical rationality. 

**Section 3: Objections**. Section 3 presents a sampling of the powerful objections critics have offered to various aspects of MacIntyre’s theory.  Also, I shall try to identify the main types of critic — crudely put, they are modernists, postmodernists, and MacIntyre’s own fellow Thomists. While it will be impossible to do justice to the excellent replies from MacIntyre's sizable crowd of friends and opponents, I shall  focus on what three of what I take to be three families of superlatively important challenges. The first family of objections pertains to moral  relativism; many worry that MacIntyre has undercut any possibility of intelligibly defending the robust moral realism inherent to the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The second family of objections pertains to rationality and tradition (which are inextricably related in MacIntyre’s work, as we shall see); some worry that his theory of rationality is plainly incoherent.  Others worry that it is coherent but that MacIntyre’s espousing of it *while* arguing his particular ethical conclusions amounts to a performative contradiction. The third family of objections pertains to teleology and the concept of telos; some worry that trying to shoehorn teleology back into ethics, even if it were desirable to do so, will require accepting tenets from a discredited Aristotelian metaphysics of nature; others argue that ethics can get along well enough without any need for *telos*. 

**Section 4: Discussion**. Section 4 discusses these various objections and considers whether  MacIntyre’s virtue theory contains the resources with which to answer them satisfactorily.  While I cannot claim to finally calm the worries of his critics, I argue that each of these three families of objections can be answered. His notion of virtue is not, at the end of the day, relativistic. I take 'relativism' to be a constellation of theses to the effect that no one person’s or culture’s conception of virtue is rationally superior to any other’s. Secondly, his notion of tradition-constituted rationality, while frustratingly open to interpretation (by philosophers from varying traditions!) is ultimately a powerful and useful framework with which to explain the paradoxical phenomena of widespread moral disagreement *alongside* widespread moral agreement. Thirdly, the needed type of teleology for MacIntyre’s proposed restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue is credible within our context of modern science, so long as we carefully distinguish various possible types of ‘teleology’ (e.g., there are at least four: cosmic, metaphysical, biological, and social teleologies). With all that said, I shall argue that we should expect any “answer” to such fundamental worries to expose deep metaphilosophical fault lines. So, I shall caution MacIntyre’s allies and enemies to be cautious about hastily labeling each other as “unphilosophical” on the basis of an inability — at the moment — of finally adjudicating these disputes. I shall close this chapter with a reflection on why some find MacIntyre’s philosophical ethics so infuriating and easy to misunderstand. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 

## Tradition and history ##

My first goal in this chapter is to make an adequate presentation MacIntyre's account of virtue. However, it would be unwise quickly to dive in to that presentation without two preliminaries. To see why, consider two of his early (and by no means final) formulations of a definition of virtue: First, he defines virtues as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] And secondly:

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]

These formulations define virtue in terms of "practices" that an individual engages in throughout his or her "whole life", all in context of a "tradition". These three concepts -- practice, life, and tradition -- are constitutive pieces of MacIntyre's account of virtue. While discussions of *practice* and *life* can wait, I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain *tradition* at the outset. Thankfully, a brief preliminary explanation will suffice for now. More details will emerge as they are needed.

### We inhabit a tradition ###

MacIntyre maintains that every inquirer inhabits a tradition. What does this mean? First we must take the point in its least controversial and hence most trivial sense that each inquirer is an embodied human being, living in a particular time and place, speaking (and perhaps thinking) within a given language, inquiring within a particular social setting. These trivia are not very interesting yet. But they are only the beginning.  

What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222. He specifies that the content of the tradition is self-reflexive: "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition."] deriving from a source text and continuing across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Tanakh) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Tanakh and later commentaries. Augustinianism is a tradition rooted in the Holy Bible and Augustine's corpus, consisting in socially-embedded arguments over how to best interpret and apply Augustine; history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to define history, how to conduct historical enquiry. 

With all this said, MacIntyre assumes that "we" inhabit a tradition. Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism does not correlate to the contemporary political division between “conservatives” and “liberals.” Rather, liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives”.) For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

In the (1990) Gifford Lectures, MacIntyre presented three rival versions of moral inquiry as expressions of three rival traditions.[@macintyre1990three] A book was later made of these lectures. Richard Forty wrote that the book “deepens and defends MacIntyre’s claim that genuinely rational enquiry requires membership in a particular type of moral community. He offers the most persuasive recent restatement of the Thomist position on the relation of metaphysics to morality.” What are the “three rival versions”? He labels them ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and ‘tradition’. Now, the use of the single word ‘tradition’ to mean both the genus (with three species) *and* one of those three species is deadly confusing, so I propose to call the third tradition Thomism. 

The three are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. Genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Thomists use the past as a basis for building upon and yet transcending the past. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think “we have arrived.” Thomists think, in advance, that those in the future will use the present as a foundation for building upon and yet transcending the present. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, though Foucault and Derrida get honorable mention. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica* and to Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. As for the *Britannica*, one reviewer put the point this way: “The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms." For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. I was educated in a modern university on modern fare, as were my readers (I presume). So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. It has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Within modernity, we analytic philosophers have further source texts in Russell, Frege, and Wittgenstein, instigating arguments over how to best conduct philosophical enquiry, the definition of analytic philosophy, and the relationship between language and thought. These arguments take place almost exclusively in a university setting, through academic books, conferences, lectures, seminars, and journal publications rather than (as in other times) through newspapers, popular books, parliamentary debates, and so on. 

The difference between 'tradition' and neighbor concepts, such as culture, theory, institution, inquiry, and practice will, I hope, become clearer below. And a few objections to MacIntyre's allegedly vague definition will be discussed below. The reader is not yet expected to agree with such a characterization of tradition. It is sufficient, at this juncture, to grasp the point and to grant it as an axiom for what follows. 

### MacIntyre's intellectual history ###

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a living moral tradition, the Aristotelian tradition. Before I presented his account of virtue, I needed to supply at least a makeshift account of tradition. There is one other account I need to give. Even with a notion of ourselves as embodied members of a living tradition of Enlightenment modernity in hand, it would be an injustice to MacIntyre's way of presenting his theory as the fruit of his own philosophical enquiry if I did not briefly tell the story of that enquiry. 

MacIntyre's intellectual history is a story of several intellectual crises. Each crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover not just a more adequate answer to the particular intellectual problem but to reflect on methodology. 

He grew up in a "border" culture between rustic Scottish fishing villages and the elite intellectual life offered him at the independent Epsom College and by his tutor R. G. Collinwood. During his undergraduate study of the classics at Queen Mary College of the University of London, he acquired an interest in ethics. He pursued an M.A. At the University of Manchester and wrote his thesis ("*The Significance of Moral Judgments*") critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. 

From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] Many who critique the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity end up with "the masters of suspicion" who distrust thought, language, and rationality itself. MacIntyre took a surprising course. The kinds of critical analysis the "masters of suspicion" use did level to the ground much of the edifice of modernity. But rather than embracing a thorough, cynical, postmodernism of this sort, MacIntyre took to an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue, and eventually Thomism, that MacIntyre continues to build. 

One of MacIntyre's most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive. He invitation is this: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

Now, MacIntyre's image is not merely about morality as one sub-field within academic philosophy. It is about morality as part of the fabric of social and political life, part of what binds groups together, gives urgency and meaning to their joint projects, sustains consensus about civil laws by which honors and goods are distributed and criminal punishments are delivered. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any applied ethical issue you can think of such as the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation and so on. They also disagree about the background issue in resolving practical moral problems -- that is, which normative framework to use, deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism, quietism, ironic nihilism or something else entirely. Modern ethicists have sometimes taken comfort in the retreat to meta-ethics. Perhaps stepping back from sticky normative questions will permit the calm, cool, and rational resolution of some problems in moral semantics, moral metaphysics, and moral epistemology. Yet after a century of metaethics, the field has not consolidated but proliferated moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreement on the formal and material propositions under dispute. It seems that deep and abiding disagreement within normative ethics and metaethics is the defining datum of modern moral philosophy. This is the "catastrophe" MacIntyre pictures above.

Rather than despair, MacIntyre observed an analogy between morality and science that proved extremely fruitful. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences. What if a similar structure obtained in revolution between paradigms or traditions in the "moral sciences"? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. Briefly, as I read it, Kuhn's work directly confronts the widespread and naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquiry has been growing in slow and steady straight line since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. But some stagnate. A paradigm is a research program that unites many researchers with a methodology and unites their conclusions within a stable scientific system of doctrine. The encyclopedia of knowledge can be augmented or pruned, but its taxonomy stays mostly the same. A paradigm comes in for trouble when lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. If not resolved, these worries bloom into a full-blown epistemological crisis. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm becomes entrenched in the establishment. Once young, rebellious, and revolutionary, it becomes middle-aged, stable, and respectable. It is the scientific paradigm of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm. 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful." He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyerabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] The parallel between the two explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. MacIntyre’s ethical theory is both extremely cognizant of historical background and extremely cognizant of methodology; some have thought his ethics (of the good) collapses into epistemology (a means of rationally identifying the good). The thought is a mistake, but an understandable one. An understandable mistake that also happens in the philosophy of science. 

This comparison between *ethical* crises and *scientific* crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. 

MacIntyre's ethical philosophy began in crisis and despair, but did not end there. It ended, rather, in a thoroughgoing Thomism that is at once historicist and progressive, at once optimistic and anti-relativistic. Making sense of such a conclusion is not easy. But it is much easier if we are clear about where his radical critic of the modern tradition arises from, and how he aims to solve it. 

## Virtue, Practice, Tradition

I can now present MacIntyre's account of virtue.  His virtue theory is not fully supplemented until he completes the“*After Virtue* Project” consisting of *After Virtue* (1984), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988); *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990); and *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999). But the most focused presentation is *After Virtue*. We will begin there. 

In this section, I will reflect in detail on his initial definition, which he derives from a careful study of the traditions of virtue from Homer, Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragic poets, the New Testament, Aquinas, Jane Austen, and Benjamin Franklin. Then I will summarize how he expands this definition with supporting concepts such as the self (which is the bearer of individual virtue), practice (which is an activity in which virtues are needed), practical reason (which is our human nature). 

Each of these interlocking concepts build on and also support his conception of virtue. If these concepts as presented are accurate to the phenomena of human life, then each one lends support to MacIntyre’s conviction that “humans need the virtues.” 

### Virtue — a first pass

MacIntyre’s philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’ within *After Virtue*. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and concludes with his own His account is historical but not historicist; it aims for universality but is not purely abstract conceptual analysis. It is, in a word, traditional. MacIntyre’s definition emerges from history but is not restricted to its history; he does not vow to conserve. Yet it does not appear “out of heaven”, unprecedented, unpredicted, unaccountable, and ready-made. 
His first definition, as mentioned above, is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191] A few initial comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are acquired *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre later changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are *acquired* human qualities. In the first line of Plato's *Meno*, Meno asks Socrates a question that moral philosophers have continued to try to answer for the last 2,400 years. He asks "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is *acquired.* This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. In this, he agrees with Aristotle that virtue is *in accordance with* nature but not *by nature*. That is, we might say, virtues do not arise "automatically" but also are not acquired by working against the grain of our human nature. Rather, they can be seen as a "normal" psychological outgrowth of cultivating certain human practices. 

Thirdly, virtues enable their possessor to achieve particular *goods.* There are two implicit points here. Virtues by definition are beneficial. A virtuous trait *cannot* be directed at achieving ills. This point solves by definitional fiat a very vexing question that recurs often in ethical philosophy, namely, can overall vicious and wicked people have particular virtues? Can the thief be courageous, the dictator magnanimous, the glutton affable? It certainly seems that the answer is yes. I shall discuss this point a bit more under the objection of relativism. 

A second implicit point is that virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally.  A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both instrumental (to the achievement of certain goods) and also *partly constitutive of those goods.* Virtues are both means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

This worry exposes deep fault lines. For the sake of completing my presentation of virtue, I must set it aside for now. I shall return to it under the heading of the objection about teleology.  

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference goods internal to *practices*. Practice is a key term of art within MacIntyre's theory of virtue. To misunderstand 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So with these initial comments in hand, I shall more deeply explore MacIntyre's unfolding account of virtue in the following sub-sections. Each section will elaborate on one of the following key components: practice, self, and tradition. 

### Practice ###

What is a practice? A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends. Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, and political activity as examples *inter alia*. A practice is not merely a reflexive action (like scratching an itch) nor merely a single, discrete, intelligible action (like pulling a weed); it is an intelligible set of actions such as tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc., all embedded within a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is a social activity undertaken (let's say) for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

Leading MacIntyre scholar, Christopher Lutz, analyzes MacIntyre’s famous passage into the following four statements. A practice is: 

&gt;[1] a complex social activity that [2] enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. [3] Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, [3] the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.[@lutz2015] 

As this explication makes more clear, MacIntyre’s notion of virtue and practice is tied to the goods “internal to” practices. He later calls internal goods "goods of excellence" and calls external ones "goods of effectiveness.” The point here is, I think, clear. The goods internal to farming are just those that *necessarily constitute success within a given practice as it is*: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers aim to produce comestibles, but I am generalizing.) Virtues relative to the practice of farming might include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Mere efficiency in attaining such external goods does not entail the presence of a virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just a neutral desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

An illustrative example is political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the *polis*. But others (we need not speculate the proportion!) engage in order to achieve “external”, unessential, goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power. Very often we see American politicians running for office with apparently only one aim: book sales. 

As I see it, virtue defined by practice can already be significantly contrasted against mere *happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. On the one hand, the standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal formal laws. They are “contentful,” immanent, flexible standards. On the other hand, the standards by which practitioners judge each other are not all “external” ; they are not merely an arbitrary set of social conventions. Farmers cannot get together and decide farming is no longer about husbandry but is about selling land along highways for billboard advertisements. The practice itself, with its history and its aims, has a structure that is persists across generations and flexes, but does not break, with varying standards. That structure is passed along, modified, but modified according to an inner logic. Many have agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe’s characterization of consequentialism more generally that it views all consequences as “external.” She puts the point in this way: 

&gt;Now the consequentialist has no footing on which to say "This would be permissible, this not"; because by his own hypothesis, it is the consequences that are to decide, and he has no business to pretend that he can lay it down what possible twists a man could give doing this or that; the most he can say is: a man must not bring about this or that; he has no right to say he will, in an actual case, bring about such-and-such unless he does so-and-so.[@anscombe1958 13] 

I shall return to this discussion of external goods below in the teleological objection. 

The internal goal of farming is (by my hypothesis) the production of edible food; its practitioners *as farmers* are committed to this goal without any eye toward broader features of farming as a business. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. By contrast, the practice of farming demands specific virtues. A farmer must be honest in order to maintain positive relationships with various suppliers and buyers; a farmer must be courageous, willing to withstand real pain and risk possible harm for the sake of the good being pursued, in order to face unseasonable weather, illness, or other misfortune. 

### Self ###

MacIntyre's account of virtue begins in terms of practices. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. A second layer of his account in *After Virtue* defines virtues as beneficial *to* human beings, human selves.[@macintyre1984after chapter 15.] Humans perform practices; humans are the bearers of virtues and vices. What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. Drawing the contrast between MacIntyre’s view and the modern puts into clear relief the differing conceptions of the good, of nature, and of *telos*. 

The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast well enough to quote them in full:

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a telos, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific *telos* brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a *telos* external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. Indeed, they celebrate the empty self. The elimination of these strictures seem an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

It is difficult to understate the importance of this point about the self and its relation to not only virtue theory but ethical theory itself. Edward Oakes describes the removal of *telos* from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”

&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed.
&gt;This is perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy. Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of telos, restored to its proper place. In the modernist picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. My present self is a time slice of my overall total self (through time), I am able to know facts and value values, I have my own good separate and apart from your good and that of my family and community and society. In the traditional picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. In the present, I owe my being and personhood to the past (especially my family who biologically gave me being) and psychologically and culturally to my tradition. I am able to know truth, for there is only one manifold of truths. My good is that of my community; my community’s good is that of mine. These data are fundamental. 

On this issue, MacIntyre argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self.  While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a few comments are worth making to clarify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map.

Two considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

By contrast, it seems that each of us takes an identity, at least in part, from our past and from our tradition. 

### *Telos* and happiness ### 

For MacIntyre, the loss of *telos* (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But *telos* unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear *telos* is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

In the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”, the *Nicomachean Ethics*, MacIntyre finds the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific *telos*. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that *telos*.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The *telos* of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 

His provisional conception of our human *telos* is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human *telos* is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single *telos* governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and *telos* comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our *telos*. 

MacIntyre says: 

&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of *telos* as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not a eudaimonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaimonist. He seems to be saying that our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human *telos* (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the *telos* might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate *telos* of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. 

I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

Thus far, we have seen that MacIntyre presents virtues as those qualities acquired by individual selves in the performance of practices that serve the intrinsic teloi or ends of those practices. 


### An initial worry 

One worry that many readers have shared is that MacIntyre’s account of virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a “practice”? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. MacIntyre vehemently denies being a relativist and devotes the whole of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* to capturing the truth in relativity while escaping relativism.[@macintyre1984after xii-xiii in the 25th anniversary edition] 

He admits that there *might* be evil practices. (We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil.) If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. To avoid relativism, he must say something to do justice to the assumption that virtues are not neutral with respect to ends, but are actually *good* for their possessor. He must put practice into a broader teleological context and question whether life *as a whole* can be virtuous. He does say that the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] (Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition.) Even putting human life into a unified, narrative context does not ultimately solve the problem of relativism. For we still might worry: is there a single *telos* for human life? Is there a unity to all the virtues such that “wicked virtues” can be excluded? And if so, is it rooted in our “metaphysical biology” as Aristotle thought? 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third layer in the *After Virtue* account. His answer to this worry is, I believe, the crux of his whole theory of ethics. It appeals to two concepts that are, for him, intimately bound up with each other. The two concepts are practical reason and human nature. (In the next section, I shall show how practical rationality and tradition meld into one concept.) I shall discuss each in turn and attempt to show how they are unified in MacIntyre’s thought. 

### We are practical reasoners ###

I would like to add details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to *Whose Justice?* The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally significant as our independence, autonomy, or self-sufficiency. In other words, there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate the commonalities between us and other animals. He says: 

&gt;“I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

The point, I take it, is that we are practical reasoners. Imagine any scenario of humans gathering and doing what comes naturally, and it will involve group deliberation about what to do: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

This is the first point. The second is that our lives are not lived out as adults, but progress from young, to middle aged, to old. Regarding point (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says:  

&gt;“Virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities that are specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how and why they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9] 

How do the arguments of *After Virtue* connect to these points? We may fairly draw this connection: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and the virtues that enable them must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

Whatever definition of virtue we settle on will generate a “list” of virtues. Whatever virtues are included on the list had better not exclude virtues that make human life possible; it had better not exclude (as Aristotle did) women and manual workers from the very possibility of developing virtues. 

We can see how the structural limits on what it means to be human begin to set boundaries on our ethical theories. Empirical study cannot tell us what is good, but it can set limits on *what is not* going to be good for creatures like us. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] But our practical reasoning sets us apart in some respects. We have the burden and responsibility to set the course for our own lives, and to care for the dependent among us who are not yet practical reasoners or who are no longer such. 

The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. This makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. Vices harm the dependent and restrict them from becoming independent practical reasoners. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. Weinstein says that the primary theme of his work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre %%page number%%] In this he defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but simply is the domain of *living well*.  *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

Our human nature as dependent practical reasoners also clarifies why prudence or *phronesis* is the master virtue. It complements and completes every other moral virtue. MacIntyre defends Aristotle’s conception of the practical syllogism wherein the major premise is an evaluative judgment about a virtue or action-type; the minor premise is a truth judgment about a situation or action-token; the conclusion is *an action*. For example, “I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting a student’s attempt to bribe me for a higher grade. This student is attempting to bribe me for a higher grade. Therefore, in this case, I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting this student’s attempt to bribe me.” Without moral virtues, prudence is simply the knowledge of *what is to be done*. Without prudence, the moral virtues are simply skills or habits that might be serviceable to bad ends; one might be excellent in achieving *what is not be done*. 

The mastery of prudence over other virtues also unifies the other virtues. *Dependent Rational Animals* advances MacIntyre’s virtue theory in that it supplies a basis for the unity of intellectual and moral virtues, for the unity of the various moral virtues, and for unity of the various stages of the narrative of *human* life. The paradoxical notion of “wicked virtues” are explained only with this broad context of human life, and with this definition of human nature. As Christopher Lutz says, “The strength of MacIntyre's account of practices is that the pursuit of excellence in a practice entails the pursuit of virtue, but if practices can be evil, and virtues can "enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to” such an evil practice, and virtues can be anything at all.[@lutz2004tradition 101]

Although these responses to the initial worry about relativism may bring up more questions than they answer, they at least present a coherent picture of human life and the qualities needed to live it well. 

### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

For MacIntyre, moral enquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such enquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. 


## Objections 

MacIntyre’s work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of readers, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, I shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

In the following sub-sections, I group his three types of critics. Then, I articulate and discuss key objections especially from his “encyclopedist” critics. 

The primary objection regarding virtue as he defines it relative to practices, the narrative of human life, and tradition, is the charge of relativism. This is a weighty objection and deserves almost a whole chapter in its own right. 

A related objection regarding tradition-constituted rationality charges MacIntyre with an incoherent definition of tradition; if some traditions are truly incommensurable to each other, and MacIntyre himself is truly situated within a tradition, then writing a book like *After Virtue* which is written from a universal, objective, view-from-nowhere should be impossible. Writing *After Virtue* and defending a theory of virtue amounts to a performative contradiction. 

The third objection regarding teleology and the “quest” for human happiness or fulfillment is twofold: on the one hand, it seems that modern moral philosophy can get along quite well without teleology. On the other hand, even if it couldn’t, then that seems to indict philosophical ethics entirely as unscientific, hopeless, superstition. 

I summarize the secondary literature on these points, as well as MacIntyre’s replies, and attempt to adjudicate the conflict. Finally, I shall close with a reflection on why his philosophical ethics is so liable to misunderstanding and, to some, so infuriating. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


### Relativism objections

Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted by being called 'a giant' in Lilliput but 'a midget' in Brobdingnag; the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is pejoratively called a rationalist by the fideist and a fideist by the rationalists; he is called a progressive by traditionalists and a traditionalist by progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. 

The most recurring objection to MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy is a cluster of worries about relativism. Ironically, and perhaps comfortingly, he is accused of being too relativistic and of being not being enough of a relativist. 

Briefly put, the worry is this: MacIntyre's virtue, it seems, is relative to practices, to communities, to institutions, or to “rival versions of moral enquiry” — in a word, virtue is relative to traditions. It is entirely possible for traditions to be incommensurable with each other. Hence, it is possible for conceptions of virtue to be incommensurable with each other. 

Acceptance of a tradition entails acceptance of *a* particular definition of virtue and list of virtues; denial of a tradition (or denial of *tradition itself*) entails the rejection of any definition of virtue and list of virtues. In light of this interpretation of his ethical theory, all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that group consider to be virtues, not what virtues *actually are*. The inquirer interested in, say, which tradition is *correct* or which version of moral enquiry is *correct* is at a loss. We might call this “tradition relativism”.

How do we make sense of this objection? First we have to stipulate what "relativism" is. Fully defining the constellation of (sometimes conflicting) positions that fly under that heading is no small task. Instead of attempting to adjudicate them, I shall follow Stephn Lutz: “Relativism” is a conclusion of an enquiry to the effect that there are no truths free from contingent, historical conditions of the would-be knower.[@lutz2004tradition 66] To the relativist, the knower's individual or cultural perspective is both starting point and ending point of any enquiry. 

Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] Three of these are misunderstandings, three are justifiable questions that MacIntyre's theory, fully developed, can answer, and three are legitimate observations of the limits of MacIntyre's theory. Whether the identification amounts to a "critique" depends on whether those limits are *the actual limits* on enquiry. 

I shall briefly summarize Lutz' discussion of the first six criticisms before addressing more fully the last three. 

#### Feldmen ####

That of Susan Feldman[@feldman1986objectivity] misinterprets MacIntyre’s project as a failed and incoherent attempt to resolve factious, subjective ethical disputes by judging them from an abstract, objective, ideal observer. But MacIntyre never explicitly presents his theory as an ideal observer theory; rather, he explicitly denies it. The ideal observer would have to *begin* the enquiry from the view from nowhere, which is impossible for us. MacIntyre just is not building -- not even *attempting* to build -- a procedural meta-ethics with which to adjudicate otherwise intractable normative disagreements. 


#### Wachbroit ####

A second criticism is from Robet Wachbroit.  MacIntyre himself responded to Wachbroit in the second edition of *After Virtue*.[@wachbroit1984relativism] Wachbroit's worry is about the fundamental plurality of rationalities. He thinks MacIntyre faces a dilemma. Either MacIntyre himself writes from the view from nowhere, the Enlightenment objectivity, the archimedean point, or he writes from within the Aristotelian tradition. MacIntyre seems to get caught in this dilemma in sentences like these: "It scarcely needs repeating that it is the central thesis of *After Virtue* that the Aristotelian moral tradition is the best example we possess of a tradition whose adherents are entitled to a high measure of confidence in its epistemological and moral resources."[@macintyre1984after 277] To whom does that 'we' refer? The dilemma, again, is that either 'we' are the Enlightened modern liberals or 'we' are the dyed-in-the-wool Aristotelians. On the first horn, if he writes from the view-from-nowhere, then MacIntyre is simply a modern meta-ethicist writing modern meta-ethics. He is criticizing liberalism from within the liberal tradition; he is borrowing the resources of the liberal definition of rationality to posit a theory in which no one definition of rationality has the resources to write books like *After Virtue*. On the second horn, if 'we' are card-carrying Aristotelians, it is trivial and almost tautologous to assert that 'we' take a high measure of confidence in Aristotelianism's epistemological and moral resources. Of course 'we' do! That kind of heady confidence that 'we' are up to standards arises within *each* tradition according to *that* tradition's own standards. 

Wachbroit misunderstands MacIntyre's theory ever so slightly here. MacIntyre can run through the horns of the dilemma. The 'we' need not be an ideal observer from a God's-eye point of view nor an Aristotelian already subsumed in the Aristotelian tradition. The 'we' can be those of us within broader western culture who have faced or might face the same kind of epistemological crisis that lead MacIntyre (and others) to critically evaluate the present state of western culture. The adherent of liberalism and the adherent of Aristotelianism share a common social, historical, and traditional root. Without too much difficulty, they can learn each other's conceptual vocabulary as a 'second language'. By self-reflecting upon the Enlightenment "branch" of the broader western tradition, and by facing up to its inadequacies and epistemological inconsistencies, the liberal adherent can test for him or herself whether the Aristotelian tradition has more resources for solving problems that are problems *by liberalism's own lights*. If, as MacIntyre did, such a person discovers that the Aristotelian has more resources for solving those problems, he or she might make rejoin with that older but no less thriving tradition. 

#### Colby Objection ####

Mark Colby misunderstands MacIntyre's project as an attempt to develop a new, objective criterion of truth that will solve the problem of epistemological crisis, regardless of one's tradition. On Colby's reading, MacIntyre is a kind of pragmatist, where the truth is just the conclusion of a certain sort of rational enquiry. But MacIntyre denies this. The test of a traditon's rationality is its adequation to reality. Lutz illustrates this with the example of astronomy. 

&gt; Ptolemaic astronomy lasted 1000 years because it solves a set of astronomical problems better than any of its opponents, including the heliocentric models of Aristarchus and Copernicus. Nevertheless, it did not adequately characterize the true nature of planetary motion and so under close evaluation it was plagued by inefficiencies that lead its adherents into a epistemological crisis. The theory that overcame Ptolemaic astronomy did so because it solved the astronomical problems or adequately than the Ptolemaic model, and it was confirmed by its predictive capacity. The fact that Kepler's astronomical model once subsumed into Newtonian physics, could predict novel facts provided confirmation that it was not only a clever description of a puzzling phenomenon, but a more adequate characterization of its object: the true nature of planetary motion.
&gt; what counts as progressiveness in the epistemological crisis resolution is improved adequacy to truths, but it pissed him logical crises only rise *within* traditions. Ptolemaic astronomers overcame *their* epistemological crisis when they abandoned *their own* geocentric beliefs Intertraditional considerations arise only when the adherents of one tradition are able to recongize in the resources of another tradition a more adequate solution to their own epistemological crisis. So progressiveness in epistemological crisis resolution cannot function as an intertraditional norm of rationality. This is no challenge to MacIntyre, however, because MacIntyre does not envision epistemological crisis as a tool for comparative ethics or meta-ethics.[@lutz2004tradition 91]

As I understand Lutz' point here, Colby is conflating the attempt of an inquirer *within* a tradition to resolve his or her epistemological crisis through examining the resources of a rival tradition with the attempt of an inquirier *outside* both traditions to resolve "epistemological crisis" per se by developing an intertraditional or trans-traditional criterion of adequacy. MacIntyre thinks the former is possible (and happens often) but that the latter is impossible. 

#### Roque Objection ####

Alicia Juarrero Roque surfaces another possible misinterpretation. MacIntyre claims that "comparison" between traditions is possible for an inquirer. But it is not possible by the attainment of an objective, context-free stance. Rather, each inquirier acquires a conceptual framework from his own tradition -- this is like a "first language." But each inquirer has the capacity to learn a "second first language". We can learn another conceptual framework philosophical imagination, through taking it *as if true* even before affirming it *as true*. Why do this? Usually because the inquirer's own tradition has failed him; he sees its inadequacies, he sees its problems and contradictions, he sees that it fails to live up to its own standards. MacIntyre describes what "rare gift of empathy" that this "philosophical imagination"[ makes possible: “…understand the theses, arguments, and concepts of their rival in such a way that they are able to view themselves from such an alien standpoint and to re-characterize their own beliefs in an appropriate manner from the alien perspective."[@macintyre1988whose 167]

Roque's worry is that the capacity for learning a second first language is an innate, rational capacity that *all people share.* If so, then belief in such a capacity contradicts the definition of tradition-constituted rationality. If not, then the absence of such a capacity renders tradition comparison impossible. MacIntyre's response is flatly to deny this interpretation of his work. The "capacity" to learn another tradition as a "second first language" is a "rare gift of empathy" and in no way part of a supposed bundle of innate capacities. This rebuttal does not make such a capacity unproblematic; we still might wonder whether, for an given inquirer, that inquirer's estimation that he possesses the gift of empathy and philosophical imagination isn't just a re-statement of the trivial thought, "I think I am right."


#### Evil practices ####

As we observed earlier, virtues exist only in the context of practices. Yet some practices seem to be evil. MacIntyre's earlier theory cannot overcome this objection, Lutz argues. He says:

&gt;Unfortunately, the relativism of *After Virtue* cannot be overcome unless its definitions of the virtues are extended to embrace the Aristotelian and Thomistic doctrine of the unity of virtue. Macs rejection of the unity of virtue in *After Virtue* has grave implications for the rest of his virtue theory because the rejection of the unity of virtue divroces the intellectual moral virtue of prudence from the passional moral virtues of courage, temperence, and justice... Prudence becomes cleverness. Courage and temperance are relativized, so that one could reasonable speak of the virtue of courage in a Nazi... Likewise, justice is reduced to some notion of fairness.[@lutz2004tradition 98]

There have been ethical philosophers who endorse this kind of reductive virtue. Lutz mentions Edmund Pincoff as an "emotivist virtue theorist" (using "emotivist" in the narrower, MacIntyrean sense). Lutz continues by examining the implications of such a theory. Such a move has two main effects: (1) "It constitues the rejection of the Aristotelian practical syllogism that MacIntyre wanted to recover in *After Virtue* because it separates prudent reasoning from virtuous action. (2) It evacuates all falsifiable substantive moral content from the virtues, reducing them to enabling qualities."[@lutz2004tradition 100] The commonsense definition of "virtue" includes positive valence. A virtue is, within our tradition, a quality *admirable for its own sake* or else a quality that enables its bearer to *achieve admirable goals*. If a procedure results in a definition of virtue wherein even bad qualities or even good qualities that enable any given wicked goal, then the procedure has gone awry. 






### Incoherence of the concept 'Tradition' and rationality Objection

The set of relativism objections and replies to them push us to articulate more clearly MacIntyre’s theory of rationality. Ethical reasoning is practical reasoning; and practical reason is a mode of *reasoning* per se, a mode of practical rationality in action. Living well depends on thinking well, though of course thinking well is merely necessary and not sufficient for living well. 

For this reason, the last objection Stephen Lutz discusses under the heading of “relativism” I shall discuss under the heading of “tradition-constituted rationality.” The objection is twofold: first, is MacIntyre’s concept of tradition-constituted rationality even coherent? Second, is it clear enough to be an indispensable feature of an ethical theory? 

 MacIntyre says on the one hand that, according to Tradition A, X is rational. According to Tradition B, X is not rational. They disagree and seem to genuinely disagree. A member of Tradition A can reasonably affirm that X cannot be both rational and irrational. Now, MacIntyre says that a member of Tradition B can discover some internal contradiction in Tradition B that makes her reconsider her tradition as aw hole. Perhaps she discovers that, according to Tradition B, Z is both rational and irrational. She is disconcerted by the contradiction. She decides to imaginatively entertain the possibility that Tradition A is more adequate and comes to see, over time, that Tradition A’s critique of Tradition B is compelling. The odd conclusion is this: affirming a contradiction is irrational for anyone in any Tradition. Now, I endorse this conclusion; if someone affirms a contradiction, and they persist in it in spite of repeated attempts to explain to them the contradiction, I would find them not just mistaken but fundamentally mentally impaired —  irrational. But the point is not whether the law of non-contradiction is true and a reliable criterion of rationality. The point is that MacIntyre cannot say so without contradicting himself. 

Suppose first that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational, while Tradition B teaches that logical contradictions can be rational. Then the member of Tradition B that affirms a contradiction (Z is both rational and irrational) will not, by her own standards, see a problem with her affirmation. A member of Tradition A will see the problem (by his own standards), but this is nothing surprising or new. The member of Tradition B has in principle no path out of her tradition, no motivation to see her tradition as mistaken, and hence no motivation to consider Tradition A. 

Suppose now that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational and Tradition B teaches the same. Now, according to MacIntyre, they agree (at least on this point) about a standard of rationality. They disagree about whether Z is rational or not, but they agree that Z cannot be both irrational and rational at the same time in the same respect. Are Tradition A and B now part of the same tradition, since they agree about the law of non-contradiction? Or are they different traditions, since they disagree about the rationality of Z? 



### *Telos* ###

A third major objection pertains to MacIntyre’s view of teleology. His whole ethical case against rival modern traditions of modernity and postmodernity is predicated on their rejection of teleology; his case for Aristotelian tradition of virtue is predicated on the recovery of *telos*. 

This objection takes two forms. On the one hand, it seems that morality (not to mention politics and society) can get along well without teleology. To make good on what is possible, one must simply furnish an example of what is actual. To make good on the usefulness and adequacy of a non-teleological ethics, one simply needs to furnish such an ethics. Two broad schools of thought take themselves to supply such an ethics: Kantian deontologists and consequentialists. 

For example, on the other hand, it might be objected that *some* modern ethics *are* teleological after all. For instance, it seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of *telos*. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). So perhaps virtue ethics can be synthesized with consequentialism. 

On the other hand, it seems that the moral law *by itself* tells us what actions are wrong or not wrong. @korsgaard1996authority argues that the autonomous moral law delivers judgments -- and generates categorical obligations -- without regard to teleology. These duties or laws are generated by our *practical identity*. That is, there are some actions that violate my practical identities. Trivially, if I call myself a baker I must bake things. If I refuse to bake I disintegrate that practical identity. Though she does not say it like this, I would state that identities are *functional concepts.* To be a farmer is in some sense to *do what farmers do*. To be a sea captain, or a teacher, or a father, is to *perform the functions* prescribed by or definitionally built into those concepts. Even if the exact limits and boundaries of a functional concept are sometimes fuzzy or flexible, they are still intelligible. Now, my first and fundamental practical identity is that of human being.[@korsgaard1996authority] I simply must value my own humanity if I am to value anything at all. And I do value things; therefore, I do value my own humanity. Anyone who values anything values their own humanity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 


## Discussion

I take it these three constellations of objections are the most telling against MacIntyre's own theory. In this section I shall attempt a rebuttal of each one. I shall close with a discussion of MacIntyre's influence and why, I think, his theories are so polarizing.

### Relativism response


Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted by being called 'a giant' in Lilliput but 'a midget' in Brobdingnag; the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is pejoratively called a rationalist by the fideist and a fideist by the rationalists; he is called a progressive by traditionalists and a traditionalist by progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. 

Now, MacIntyre denies relativism. Instead, he accepts the thesis that all of our inquiries, including our understanding of rationality itself, takes place within a cultural, historical, and traditional context. Following Lutz, we can say that MacIntyre accepts “relativity”.

Relativity (a term borrowed from Michael Krausz[@krausz1984relativism]) is a thesis about *the condition of enquiry.* It is not a thesis about the *conclusion of enquiry.* Lutz approves of Mark Colby's statement that "argumentative situatedness is inescapable."[@lutz2004tradition 89] 

Such relativity, such situatedness, is compatible with objective or absolute or mind-independent or tradition-independent *truth*. It is incompatible with an objective or absoltue or tradition-independent *rationality*. From the historically- and socially-situated position of enquiry, a philosopher (he argues) may indeed find truth. In my terms, our contingent social, cultural, and individual perspective is an alpha point of every enquiry but is not the omega point of every enquiry. 

In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, MacIntyre explicitly retracts his earlier belief that virtues exist without a unity under prudence.[@macintyre1988whose preface, p. x] The consequences of this retraction, Lutz argues, are wide-ranging and crucial to refuting the charge of relativism. If virtues are unified, then even though virtues exist only in the context of practices, "no genuine practice can be inherently evil."[@lutz2004tradition 102] Rather, practical reason can judge *apparent goods* as genuine goods. The qualities needed for achieving the spurious goods internal to that "practice" would not be virtues but only *apparent virtues*. Now, such a definition certainly seems ad hoc. But Lutz provides a persuasive illustration: eugenics. Eugenics certainly seems to bear the markings of a genuine practice. Its apparent good is the purification of the gene pool for future generations. However, genuine virtues militate *against* the achievement of that goal. For example, Lutz cites a story of a Nazi doctor who had the virtue of compassion found himself unable to pursue the program of euthanizing mentally-disabled children. Even the doctor seemed disappointed with himself, asserting that he "approve[d]" state measures with conviction" but was "too gentle for this work... Heil Hitler!"[@@poliakov1979harvest 186-7] We might also recall Huck Finn's internal struggle with his "conscience" in *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.[@twain2014adventures Chapter 31] 

Huck decides to turn Jim in to the slave owners. He writes a letter outing Jim, and feels much better after "repenting" of his theft: 

&gt;I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell...  

After vividly confronting Jim's humanity, his goodness, and their loyal friendship, he wavers. 

&gt;It was a difficult situation. I picked up the letter, and held it in my hand. I was trembling, because I knew had to make a choice between two things, and the outcome of my decision would last forever. I thought about it a minute while I held my breath. And then I said to myself: “All right, then, I’ll GO to hell"—and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

The humor of this passage arises, in large part, because of the tension between the *apparent good* of treating Jim as legal property and the *actual good* of treating Jim as an end in himself, as a free man just like any other. Huck's virtue (in this case, loyalty or friendship) *cannot* be put to use in the service of a corrupting practice like slave-trading. Just as vice subverts institutions and their worthy practices, virtue "subverts" vicious institutions and unworthy practices. Virtue marks the difference between the coward who disobeys his commanding officer's orders because the obedience would put him at risk of painful death and the courageous person who disobeys his commanding officer's order because obedience would require wrongdoing. Without prudence to discriminate between the two cases, we lack any resources by which to discriminate courage and cowardice, between a virtuous resistance and vicious resistance. 

MacIntyre's account satisfies two desideratum, which together form a paradoxical explanandum: his account explains why vices sometimes persist within pseudo-practices, institutions, and traditions from generation to generation, and it explains why practice-enabling virtues sometimes emerge to disrupt a pseudo-practice, a wicked institution, and a corrupt or at least incomplete tradition. The fact is that "many kinds of activities can be, and in fact are considered to be, practices. Some of these may conflict radically, owing to errors and insufficiences in rationlity."[@lutz2004tradition 103] Errors in rationality explain errors in traditions and hence misacriptions of the title 'virtue.' Rationality answers to truth, to the world as it is, not merely to the pragmatic reduction of truth to "dialectical success."[@lutz2004tradition 104] Hence, virtues answer to *what is really good*. They do not merely answer to "what-counts-as-good-for-us", which property is relative to each tradition. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes this iteration of the charge of relativism, while still explaining why rival traditions differ -- and sometimes radically differ -- in their evaluations and opinions. Incomplete traditions can, and do, undergo crisis. Particular persons within that tradition discover and perseverate on inadequacies within the tradition, leading to an epistemological crisis. In response, others within the same tradition may become willing to examine the resources of rival traditions and either quit their primary tradition or re-fashion it, re-make it, update it, and make real moral and intellectual progress. 

### J. L. A. Garcia ###

J. L. A. Garcia says that “MacIntyre’s rebuttal is as radical as it is ingenious. It is, in effect, to outrelativize the relativist. Rather than recoiling from relativism, as I understand his strategy, MacIntyre plunges so deeply into it, as we might say, to fall out the other side… Contrary to what he sees as the relativist’s hasty and facile assumption, MacIntyre insists that it is not necessarily (nor always) the case that everyone is so situated that there is no position whose adoption *by her* at *any* time would be rationally superiors to some particular *set* of alternatives…Now the tables are turned, and it is the relativist who appears the dogmatist, claiming to know in advance and *a priori* that no one can be so situated.” This all appears to me correct. MacIntyre uses the genealogist’s starting points to undercut the encyclopedist — a move which implicitly approves of moral relativism. But he doesn’t stop there; he uses all the resources of intellectual history and contemporary natural and social sciences to defend some (but not all) of the beliefs and values of modernity, such as the value of democracy, the value of university education, the value of history, the belief in the possibility of scientific truth, the belief in progress — a move which seems to endorse the Enlightenment and the liberal tradition as against the genealogists. To both, his challenge is to use the best resources of the past and the best rational resources of the present to defend a particular set of conclusions *as the best thus far*, as the *closest* to the truth. To both, his challenge is to defend a conception of morality and rationality *neither* claiming that any such conceptions are impossible *nor* claiming to have *concluded* the enquiry once and for all.

### Relativism Objection Conclusion ###

MacIntyre has responded to (and he thinks refuted) the charge of relativism multiple times, in his primary works and in “responses to critics.” Yet for many, relativism stains the image of MacIntyre. Even after clarifying the obscure points of the dialectic MacIntyre does endorse, the objection can be resolved but not finally refuted. I would like to offer a suggestion as to why this is so. Rather, the resolution of the criticism can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves; hence MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the enquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the enquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that enquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the enquiry. 




### Incoherence of the concept 'Tradition' and rationality Objection

I think it true that tradition influences our standards of rationality, justice, and virtue, but demonstrably false that it *constitutes* such standards. The law of non-contradiction is the counterexample. 

Every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction; every tradition denies rational agents the right to believe (P &amp; ~P). Any tradition that denies the law of non-contradiction, it seems to me, is an irrational tradition. And I don’t just intend to say it is irrational relative to my own standards of rationality, but that it is irrational full stop and possible to “step outside” my tradition far enough to see that. If there even does exist any person (such as Nagarjuna) or community or tradition that affirms (P &amp; ~P), we ought not interpret them as having a different standard of rationality but rather we ought to interpret them as believing that rationality is an obstacle to nirvana. Affirming contradictions is still irrational, but it is the kind of irrationality needed to do violence to the limits of rationality and transcend them. 

So I think MacIntyre’s unqualified claims about tradition constituting rationality should be limited to claims about other standards for acceptable kinds of evidence, etc.


#### Clarity — the Definition of tradition ####

A different angle to the same objection is the very definition of the term ‘tradition.’ Some readers, such as John Haldane, question MacIntyre’s ability coherently to identify what a tradition is. Call this the Differentiation Problem. Are two traditions separate and hence identifiable only if they are incommensurable? How much difference constitutes separation? How much overlap is compatible with difference? Jewish and Christian traditions share a common origin and bear considerable overlap in authorities, scriptures, and doctrines. 

MacIntyre’s definition makes such teasing out difficult. He characterizes a tradition as “separate and unified when its members or texts have a core set of shared commitments to beliefs, when the tradition is situated in a particular context in a particular set of institutions and when the tradition has an identifiable linguistic difference when compared to other traditions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 83] 

The response that Weinstein gives is this. We should not expect, by MacIntyre’s lights, that there is an automatically objective, view-from-nowhere by which we can define tradition itself. Rather, MacIntyre concludes that “the concept of a tradition, together with the criteria for its use and application, is itself one developed from within one particular tradition-based standpoint. This does not preclude its application to the very tradition within which it was developed.”[@horton1994after 295] This is liable to frustrate some readers. But the alternative (by MacIntyre’s lights) is intellectual imperialism wherein one tradition has the *real* scoop on every other tradition. MacIntyre grants that his self-definition of his own tradition arises, in part, from his criteria of that tradition. Traditions change over time. They progress (according to their own unchanging standards) toward unchanging goals or else they abandon old standards. 

I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. This may not satisfy critiques but it cordons off their objections. It pushes back, to demand that the critics self-reflect and specify their own tradition (in MacIntyre’s words) even as they demand a definition of the term ‘tradition’ (in their own words).

#### Justification of Morality Objection #### 

I would like to expand this objection by appeal to a slightly different one. I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection. He points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*. 

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is this: the question “why be moral?” is never asked in the abstract. Philosophers often pose the “why be moral?” question hypothetically, as if they were skeptics of one or another sort. But such an idealized moral skeptic will not do. And a non-hypothetical, non-idealized skeptic faces a problem, on MacIntyre’s theory. 

That problem is that if they are full-fledged members of their tradition, the “why be moral?” question usually does not arise. There are two exceptions: The first when persons who succeed in sincerely asking the “why be moral?” question who are, by definition, outcasts from their own society. The emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The *polis* to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the *polis* which belongs to him. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” simply do not arise. 

In drawing the distinction between the modern "emotivist self" and the "self of the heroic age" MacIntyre says, “In heroic society there is no 'outside except that of the stranger. A man who tried to withdraw himself from his given position in heroic society would be engaged in the enterprise of trying to make himself disappear.”[@macintyre1984after 126] In one sense, MacIntyre *dissolves* this worry. His strategy is not to give the skeptical “why be moral?” question the devil’s due and solve it on its own conditions; his strategy is to undermine the conditions of asking it. 

The second exception is when moral skeptics *are* members of their own tradition but are seeing the problems within their own tradition and are troubled by a “border tradition”. This skeptic sees the resources of a rival tradition and compares such favorably with the resources of his own tradition. He is, in a word, entering epistemological crisis. And to such a skeptic, MacIntyre’s theory invites him or her to do the hard work of resolving that crisis by examining, from within the context of a primary tradition *and* a “second first” tradition, the problems at hand and the available solutions, working toward an ever greater understanding of the truth. 

For this reason, again, I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. 

### *Telos* reply 

On the other hand, however, these modern moralities are either covertly teleological or they are incoherent. 

First, as MacIntyre has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without *telos* becomes unintelligible. A society that highly values some virtue (say, chastity) but does so only out of habit --  without any wisp of certain knowledge about the effect chastity has on a man or woman's whole life --  will not long retain that high opinion. Chastity as a white-knuckle fiat not to engage in sexual intercourse with anyone other than one's opposite-sex spouse is simply too difficult, psychologically and morally, to seem valuable to someone who has no clue why chastity is so good for us, and why sexual license is so disastrous for humans, families, and societies. 

### *telos* and virtue (and life, and self) are an organic whole ##

// If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover *telos*. That is, we must discover or re-discover the organic holism of the narrative unity of my life, my identity and self-concept, the *telos* of human life as a species and my own specific *telos* as a member of that species, and the virtues that are the qualities that enable me to achieve my *telos*. Not one of these parts can be left out of the whole. 

The second option is that teleology is smuggled in. Charles Taylor argues this point persuasively.[@taylor] We do not need to take the point on authority. We can rediscover it ourselves rather quickly. 

As a sample for review, examine Kantian deontology and its base-line foundation: Kant famously pronounced: "Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of it, which can be called good, without qualification, except a good will."[@kantgroundwork] This is the first principle of Kantianism: the categorical imperative, the value of humanity, the value of autonomy, the identification of a will that obeys the categorical imperative with 'the good will'.  The good will is good because it follows the good law; the law of autonomy (all other laws being heteronomous); the categorical imperative is the unconditional obligation on all practically rational beings whatsoever to treat other rational beings as ends in themselves, others being equally autonomous, others being equally human and therefore equally valuable. This is all very consistent. 

But why are humans valuable? Kant can give no answer to this. It is his own emotive assertion. 

Take any other modern moral philosophy such as Humean sentimentalism, utilitarian consequentialism, psychological egoism or contractarianism. Consider its base-line foundation, its summum bonum, its first principle, its Great Platitude, and you will discover the same baseless base, the same groundless assumption. 

For Humean sentimentalism the first principle is the relation between the good and my affections. "To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to feel a satisfaction of particular kind from the contemplation of a character."[@humetreatise 471]

For contractarianism it is the value of keeping promises. "The moral theory of contractarianism claims that moral norms derive their normative force from the idea of contract or mutual agreement." But such a value is a western prejudice.

&gt;Contracts require independent agents who are able to make and carry out promises without the aid of others. Historically, while white men have been treated as these pure wills of contract theory, Blacks and women have been treated as anti-will: dependent and irrational. Both ideals are false; whole people, she says, are dependent on other whole people. But by defining some as contractors and others as incapable of contract, whole classes of people can be excluded from the realm of justice. This point has been explored by other critics of contractarianism, first by Allen Buchanan (1993) and more recently by Eva Kittay (1999), who points out that not only are dependents such as children and disabled people left out of consideration by contractarian theories, but their caretakers' needs and interests will tend to be underestimated in the contract, as well.[@sepcontractarianism]

For consequentialism it is the value of happiness or pleasure. All that Mill can say to the inquirer who wants to hear about *why* happiness is desirable is that people desire it.

&gt;It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?
&gt;Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfill -- to make good its claim to be believed?
&gt;The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.[@mill chapter 4, "Of what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible"]

This kind of hand-waving does not inspire the confidence of eudaimonist virtue theorists who think that the "proof" of the principle of eudaimonia is "susceptible" of something much more robust. 

Reply to Objection 1. Korsgaard's point here is not far off from MacIntyre's (nor, I assume, far from Sandel's or any other communitarian's). Her thesis is that a moral identity qua practical identity is fundamental and supports other practical identities (like son, brother, citizen, teacher). Insofar as human nature is a real thing, MacIntyre can agree that humanity is a functional concept. If I am to be human, there are some deeds I must do. MacIntyre (and, I presume, other communitarians) would simply query whether I can discover my identity qua human before discovering it qua American or member of the Buhler family or "westerner". What is deepest metaphysically is last epistemologically. MacIntyre might argue that Korsgaard cannot discover her identity qua human without her western education, without reading Kant, without the benefit of being a part of the Enlightenment tradition. Korsgaard takes for granted her identity as a westerner and falsely construes that particular identity -- invisible to her -- as *the* universal human identity. Would Christine Korsgaard, the particular human being, have the same belief about human identity if she were raised not in the U. S. but in the E. U. or the U. A. E. in a different moral tradition? 

Reply to Objection 2. Consequences may be "external" or "internal." That is, consequences of an action may be non-natural or natural. The oxygenation of the blood is a natural consequence of breathing. Our biological make-up determines that the act of breathing and the oxygenation of the blood an organic whole. A natural consequence of holding your breath is a build up of carbon dioxide. Winning a world record for holding your breath underwater is a non-natural consequence of holding your breath. Consequentialists either do not distinguish between the two or are explicit that there are no ends or consequences related internally or naturally with some means. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;But before proceeding to this discussion I propose, first, to deal with the third kind of ethical question—the question: What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalization. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. Good effects Moore argues are aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships. Strangely enough, the same Moore defines the necessary relation between parts and a whole as an "organic whole" or "organic unity." But he sees no organic unity between (some) means and their ends. Some means are partially constitutive of their ends. We might say that the *means* and the *end* form in that instance an organic whole. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constitutive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species gorilla gorilla as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics. 

The problem here is inconsistency and self-deception. The modern tradition, the “traditionless-tradition” either helps itself to Aristotelian *telos* while vehemently denying it, or (if honest) collapses into the “truthless-tradition” of postmodernity. 

#### Ends/means Objection. ####

I said above that the refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. Charles Taylor endorses the notion that “the place accorded the virtues [is] a kind of litmus test for discriminating Aristotelian from modern ethical theory.”[@taylor 25]

What could this mean? Behind the means/end distinction is a peculiarly modern assumption that formal and final causes are either not related or not *necessarily* related. There are various ways of cashing out this distinction. In biology, it is the distinction between form and function.[@huneman2006naturalising] In engineering it is the distinction between design and operation.



### Even if there were no natural teloi, human action is teleological

MacIntyre has a powerful response to this objection. It is, I think, satisfying. And that is that the conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology can be side-stepped. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups (the Republican or Democratic Party, the YMCA, the U.S.A., the Parent Teacher Association, Starbucks) is end-directed actions and practices. That is enough. Call it "social teleology." 

Christine Korsgaard has defended the notion of practical reason as the faculty we discover in ourselves *after* we are already acting in the world and reflecting upon our actions.[@korsgaard1996authority] It is not really up for debate that we are reflective creatures; everyone reading this is capable of reflecting on their actions, asking for and providing *reasons* for action that may or may not justify the action. This is close, I think, to MacIntyre's way of thinking. 

Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. *telos* can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With *telos* firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether *telos* exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

### Human action is teleological

One thesis I would like to extract, develop, and defend is this: human practices are necessarily end-directed (teleological). “Social teleology” has at least two and possibly three aspects: individual, collective, and human. The first aspect of social teleology is the end-directed behavior of each agent; the second is the end-directed behavior of social groups, like families, nations, clubs, congregations, and so on. The third, and most objectionable, aspect, is the end-directed activity of our species as a whole. What, if anything, does every human being intentionally pursue? 

The answer to this question is bound to be controversial. But before we try to answer it we can pause and point out that MacIntyre has made the question intelligible and urgent. 

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. And if it is correct, it demands the re-evaluation of some cherished assumptions. 

In sum, the rebuttal of the “no need for teleology” objection is twofold: first, if the sort of teleology needed is merely social or anthropological, then that sort of teleology is defensible. Secondly, the alternative — a purely formal ethics allegedly sanitized from notions of final causation, intrinsic ends, natural purposes — is not actually an alternative to teleological ethics because it turns out to be covertly teleological in the end. 

If these rebuttals are in the right vein, then one of MacIntyre’s key points from *After Virtue*, *Whose Justice?*, and *Dependent Rational Animals* emerges as a shining light. That is, human life is teleological, and so the attempt to construct anti-teleological systems is impossible and the endeavor to conduct ourselves according to anti-teleological ethics is futile. 

Such a conclusion may be taken as quite dire. Or it may be invigorate optimism. Ethics, reinvigorated with teleology, might just be able to escape some of its modern quandaries. And not only ethics. Law, political philosophy, and applied disciplines like politics itself, rhetoric and debate, social philosophy, and others disciplines are given new promise and new hope. 


## Conclusion

### Theorist of Rationality ###

MacIntyre is a theorist of rationality (and of practical rationality and hence virtue). Hence rationally to assess his theory requires thinking through our own theory of rationality. But thinking about rationality is thinking through our own thinking. The errors we make in thinking are likely to be underscored by our attempts to *think them through*. The Greek proverb is: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” If something is deeply wrong with the way we think, how can theorizing about rationality right the wrong? The Latin proverb (from a very different context) is “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” — who will guard the guards themselves? I believe the answer to the rhetorical question is no one at all can guard the guards. If water chokes us, there is nothing we can do to wash it down and clear our throat. Similarly, some of the errors MacIntyre diagnoses in thinkers who belong to the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition will be invisible to those thinkers. 

Even if MacIntyre’s diagnosis is *correct*, especially if it is correct, the patient will find the diagnosis unintelligible, even irrational. Insofar as the patient finds any parts of his theory intelligible, they will seem radical, disastrous in their social implications, and destructive of the very nature and purpose of education. The reason these appearances will be insuperable to MacIntyre’s patient is because the patient is, by his lights, self-deceived. He or she simply denies being part of a tradition, and hence denies having a particular (rather than universal) tradition-bound conception of rationality, and hence denies having a particular, tradition-bound conception of the good (perhaps the good is unbounded freedom to follow the moral law, or to pursue happiness,, and justice unfettered equality). Modernity is the “tradition-less tradition” and hence *must* deny tradition to be consistent with itself. 

But *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and others are directed toward the discontented liberal modern. This patient comes to MacIntyre with manifesting symptoms. MacIntyre offers one possible diagnosis, and the patient’s job is to investigate further. The patient needs philosophical imagination to even *consider* the possibility of another truth. The patient needs patience, intellectual courage, and self-reflection. The patient needs to sit in front of the proverbial mirror and mouth the words, (a) “I am part of a tradition” and (b) “my tradition might be inadequate,” and (c) “that other tradition might have the resources more adequately to address the intellectual and practical problems that I now see are insuperable to my tradition.” 
It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

Nevertheless, some (like Nagel) are surprised and perhaps even offended when the religious philosopher (like MacIntyre) concludes upon decades of reflection that his secular colleague is less than rational. No! Nagel protests, the religious philosophers is less than rational — my secularism is by definition an allegiance to rationality over dogma. But Lutz rightly disentangles this web of definitional fiat and counter-fiat. If Nagel’s secularism is a dogma, and one unsustainable after decades of the most open-minded reflection upon best evidence, then the secular philosopher is not just mistaken but irrational. If this result seems surprising to the reader, it is a likely sign that MacIntyre’s theory has not yet been grasped. 

Nagel’s inability or unwillingness to consider that his secularism is a dogma or ideology would put disadvantage him relative to MacIntyre. For Nagel’s part, he *does* self-reflectively consider it, but does not express the further willingness to imaginatively and philosophically entertain the opposing tradition’s account. 

Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side just isn’t doing philosophy anymore. My only point here is that which side it is is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal, secular philosophers that MacIntyerean-type “philosophy” just isn’t.  It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian, religious philosophers that Nagalean “philosophy” just isn’t. 

### MacIntyre’s Greatness

Great thinkers — Plato, Aquinas, Kant — have a distinguishing feature of presenting a totalizing theory that not only explains a whole host of phenomena and solves problems, but explain why critics criticize. Great thinkers present not only philosophical solutions to philosophical problems, but a definition or understanding of philosophy itself. They are always philosophers *and* metaphilosophers. 

One of the features so satisfying to adherents of Plato, Aquinas, Kant (I could have mentioned a dozen others) is that their totalizing theory puts agreement in context and puts disagreement with the theory in context. It casts critics in a particular light. This is satisfying to adherents but infuriating to critics. 

One of the signs, I believe, of MacIntyre’s greatness is just this feature. He presents not only isolated theories but a theoretical system in which critics, depending on their criticism, receive a name, a number, a category, a classification, and a designated response. Adherents, too, are accommodated. But to criticize MacIntyre is much trickier business than one might suspect at first. Critics find themselves dipping into one of many already well-poisoned wells, and falling into pre-laid traps. The critic who would escape the battery is more likely to flee rather than engage; but the critic who would escape by engaging and overcoming is liable to meet her match. 

Again, while this may be infuriating, it is a sign of greatness. 

### Concluding remarks 

MacIntyre’s work is difficult to pick apart and summarize or critique in fragments. The compressions of his orchestral arguments in this chapter are inevitably going to leave some readers dissatisfied, perhaps even dismayed, by what (I have made it appear that) he is saying. Readers are of course invited to revisit the source. 

But if my summaries have captured with any accuracy the outline’s of MacIntyre’s contribution to virtue ethics, then we can say a few things with some confidence: virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. 

Differing traditions explain differing accounts of virtue. Though MacIntyre’s career began in straightforward engagement in dialectical disputes about philosophical ethics, it turned a corner when he thought to treat ethical disagreement in a manner analogous to the way Kuhn treated scientific disagreement. The result of turning this corner — MacIntyre’s own paradigm shift — was an account wherein he argues (similarly to some postmodern philosophers) that malleable traditions define standards of rationality, justice, and virtue. But he also argues, to the chagrin of postmodernists, that traditions are answerable to the world, and can be falsified.  He argues that a thoroughgoing cultural relativism (or “tradition-relativism”?) is inadequate. Such a theory holds the promise to explain why various cultures disagree about what qualities are virtues (humility or pride? acquisitiveness or contentment?) and why the same culture disagrees over time with itself about what exactly defines a particular virtue (is chastity moderation of sexual pleasure or just abstinence?) 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


Now, MacIntyre later changed his mind about the "metaphysical biology" objection. He later thought that it could be answered a second time, even more strongly. It is not just *social teleology* that necessarily exists as part of our human nature; teleology is in some sense part of non-human nature as well. He came to accept the Thomistic and ultimately Aristotelian argument that natural causes include both efficient/material causes and formal/final. He, along with many others, came to believe that modern science has succeeded *in part because of* an enduring belief in final causation or natural teleology, not because of a rejection. The story about scientists dispensing with final causes in biology and astronomy and chemistry is largely a myth. Scientists and philosophers of science abound who can give empirical and rational grounds for thinking nature is riddled with final causation. 

MacIntyre's *ethical* case does not depend on this more robust account of natural teleology. All it needs is social teleology. But if it turned out that social teleology was in *instance* of natural teleology -- that the ends of human nature were a type of the ends of nature per se -- then the framework in which virtues enable the achievement of human ends would certainly be given additional credibility. 

Making the case on behalf of natural teleology I shall not do here. That is a task for the next chapter. </Text>

            <Title>Rea, How Successful is Naturalism</Title>
            <Text>Michael Rea characterizes naturalism as either a thesis or as something else (a research program); either way, naturalism is a failure. 
What do we mean by "success" and "failure" in this context? Rea argues for a crtierion of "success" according to which a thesis or research program is not subject to "serious objections", or at least not as many as its rivals. If naturalism could be shown to be self-refuting or to "have rationally unacceptable consequences" then these would be devestating objections. But Rea thinks these objections are not "even in the right ballpark" (105%). Instead, Rea's naturalism (which I'll summarize below) fails by being "dissonant", where dissonance is "the malady that a philosophical position suffers from when it rationally commits its adherents to views that are in direct tension with whatever attitudes, goals, or values partly characterize the position" (105-6%). Not every philosophical position has "attitudes, goals," and "values", so not every philosophical position can fail by being dissonant. But positions like "empiricism, materialism, rationalism" do have attitudes, goals, and values and so are flexible enough with regard to the scientific and philosophical claims that constitute them to make consonance a virtue, and dissonance a vice. 
How serious a charge is the accusation of "dissonance"? Rea thinks that it is pretty serious. "It is not irrational to embrace a dissonant position, but it is unpleasant…" A verdict of dissonance would not have the same knock-down force of a verdict of incoherence, but it would be bad. He continues, "Dissonant theories fail along the dimensions of elegance and conservatism… It is widely acknowledged that elegance and conservatism, among other pragmatic virtues, play an important role in scientific theory choice, and there is no reason to doubt that they play similar roles in philosophical decision making." (106%).

            <Text>### MacIntyre's history and project ###

My goal in this chapter is to summarize and analyze MacIntyre's theory of virtue and practical rationality. However, it would be wise to begin by presenting some of his intellectual biography and his view of tradition. With MacIntyre in particular, knowing his story of epistemological crisis will help to make sense of the resolution of that crisis. 

MacIntyre grew up inside two cultures: a rustic Scottish fishing culture and an elite Scottish intellectual culture. For this reason, in part, his theory emphasizes the importance of being able to understand multiple cultures. He attended Epsom College at age sixteen where he was tutored by R. G. Collinwood. He acquired an interest in ethics during undergraduate study and wrote his M.A. thesis critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. But the trouble he found with emotivism applied to other modern moral philosophies. 

One of MacIntyre’s enduring themes is that we all inhabit a tradition, including anti-traditionalist moderns. His critique of modernity is a critique of a tradition, and his eventual solution is the Aristotelian tradition of virtue.` Yet the concept is liable to fatal misunderstanding. I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain it at the outset.  

What does it mean to assert that “we all inhabit a tradition”? Most trivially, it means each of us are embodied, live in a time, place, and social setting, and speak a given language. More interestingly, it means that each of us (intellectuals at the least) owe our conceptual resources to a tradition. What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222]. The content of a tradition is partly self-reflexive: it is "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition." Traditions derive from a source text and continue across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Torah) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Torah, the whole Tanakh, the Talmud, and later commentaries. Also history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to conduct historical enquiry. 

Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. It is not politically left-leaning or liberal in the contemporary sense but includes right-leaning conservatives as well. For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

MacIntyre’s most thorough treatment of the theme of moral traditions is the (1990) Gifford Lectures. There he presents three “rival versions of moral enquiry.” They are ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and a third version he simply calls ‘tradition’ but I will call ‘Thomism.’ The three rivals are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. For example, genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, but Freud and Marx count as well. Stephen Lutz says: 

&gt;The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, Genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.[@lutz2015]

By contrast, encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think we have *arrived*. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica*, about which one reviewer said:

&gt;The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms.

Another exemplary encyclopedist is Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. 

How did MacIntyre “deconvert” from modernism? It began with ethics. What troubled him about emotivism in particular and modern metaethics in general was an assumption shared by emotivists, intuitionists, naturalists, and error theorists that moral terms are referential. He argued that this assumption is a mistake. By contrast, he concluded that the significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Instead of referring (or failing to refer) to a special 'moral property', all evaluative reasoning practical reasoning, reasoning what to do. Hence, there can be no adequate theory of ethics apart from a theory of (practical) rationality. A recurring them of MacIntyre's work is that moral reasoning is practical reasoning. That is, moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself. 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] It was the tradition MacIntyre was raised in. It is the tradition I was raised in, as (I presume) were my readers. So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. 

As a member of the modern tradition, he gradually discovered its inadequacies.  His attempt to trace the root of the mistake about moral judgments lead him to a mistake at the heart of Enlightenment modernity. As a social, political, and moral project, the Enlightenment has been, MacIntyre argues, a failure by its own standards. One of his most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe...Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance... all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. But an obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. Neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity. An explanation of this disagreement is that we are trying to get by using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. But the problem is not merely academic. The social and political fabric is woven from the thread of morality, so many of the ills of modern life can be traced to our inability to share a substantive conception of the good and the good life. MacIntyre has earned a reputation as a "critic of modernity."[@mcmylor2005alasdair] This reputation, while justly earned, should not overshadow the constructive alternative he presents.

The social and political fabric is woven from the thread of morality, so many of the ills of modern life can be traced to our inability to share a substantive conception of the good and the good life. Modernity has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government.  For this reason, MacIntyre’s lifework has touched on not only ethics but epistemology, philosophy of religion, political philosophy, and philosophy of education. 

Due to his many critical works, MacIntyre earned a reputation as a "critic of modernity."[@mcmylor2005alasdair] But what is unusual about him is not his criticism but his eventual solution. There are many modern philosophers who have gone into similar crises. The become critics of the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity. Such become distrustful thought, language, and rationality itself; they become "the masters of suspicion."[@ricoeur1970freud. "Three masters, seemingly mutually exclusive, dominate the school of suspicion: Marx, Nietzche, and Freud." "]  MacIntyre took a surprising course. His crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover a more adequate answer to some philosophical problem. His criticisms lead him to find an older and still vital foundation amidst the ruins. It is upon this foundation -- the Aristotelian tradition of virtue -- that MacIntyre continues to build.

The story of his avoidance of despair and deconstructionism is an interesting one. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences.[@kuhn1975structure] What if a similar structure obtained in scientific revolutions and in moral revolutions? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn's (and Feyerabend’s) analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful."[@feyerabend1993against] He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack. Kuhn's concept of a paradigm is a nice analogue for MacIntyre's concept of a tradition.

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a specific, living, moral tradition -- the Aristotelian tradition. This is one of MacIntyre's recurring themes: ethical concepts have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical terms and concepts when we have some historical perspective on them. Furthermore, *we* have a history. Practical concepts such as the self, practice, the *telos* or end of life, and virtue are all  MacIntyre realized that we all inhabit a tradition -- even putatively anti-traditionalist moderns. So we must know ourselves as members of a tradition, as members of a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. These themes -- tradition have guided the construction of MacIntyre's virtue theory. 

These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.  

But it is worth saying at the outset that MacIntyre readers fall into two broad camps: those who are, on the whole, more critical of modernity, and those who, on the whole, are less critical of modernity. The former group tend to find MacIntyre's diagnosis compelling and his solutions exhilarating.  Restoring historical perspective on ethics, restoring ethical reasoning to its place within practical reasoning, and restoring *telos* promises to make available the resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The hope of a restored morality brings with it the hope of a restoration of social and political integrity. MacIntyre invites such readers to see the point of education, politics, and social life once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, to restore an intelligibility to these activities and pursuits that many of us moderns can hardly imagine. 

The latter group tend to find MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites such readers to reflect on themselves and on our common history. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modernity had these fatal flaws, would this solution be a good one?"

Toward a Metaethics of Virtue 
Toward a Metaethical Grounding of Virtue
Back to Virtue: Toward a Complete Metaethics


In this dissertation, I trace the growth and elaboration of a virtue ethics from Anscombe to the present day in which the core concepts (virtue, happiness, practical reason) can withstand all the objections posed against them and which, now as ever, explains much or all of our ethical discourse powerfully and satisfyingly. 

So, for each thinker MacIntyre, Foot, Hursthouse, McDowell, Brown, and Adams…

	1.	What is a virtue? (Ethics) Disposition?
	2.	Why be virtuous? (Motivation) 
	3.	What is happiness? (Teleology)
	4.	Human Nature
	⁃	Is human nature natural? (metaphysics)
	⁃	What is practical reason? (Epistemology)
	⁃	Is human nature (reason, virtue) divine? (Philosophy of religion)
	1.	Is happiness possible? (Ethics)
	2.	How do we adjudicate moral disagreement (metaethics)
	3.	How do virtues involve the emotions? (Psychology) 
Not answered
9. Virtue and right action — how do we put virtues into action? (Normative ethics)
10. Virtue and education — how do we help children? (Education)
11. Virtue and contentious questions (applied ethics)


Virtue theory as “bottom-up” and grounded in common morality. Common morality gathers examples of traits — like honesty — that seem objectively good (or traits like dishonesty) that seem objectively bad. Common moralists cite ethical concepts (like justice and injustice), traits (like kindness and cruelty), actions (like murder and charitable giving). Beauchamp and Childress, for instance, build a list of ten actions. “(1) Don’t kill; (2) Don’t cause pain or suffering to others; (3) Prevent evil and harm from occurring; 
(4) Rescue persons in danger; (5) Tell the truth; (6) Nurture the young and dependents; (7) Keep your promises; (8) Don’t steal; (9) Don’t punish the innocent; (10) Treat all persons with equal moral consideration.”Principles of Biomedical Ethics % 
	The theoretical goals of reflecting on these principles of common morality are:
A) to identify some principles, if any, that underly and unify this shopping list of moral laws;
B) to ground these laws or their underlying principles in reason, or the divine will, or human nature, or something more objective than mere “objective purport.”
C) To provide theoretical unification or at least a kind of reflective equilibrium with our best scientific accounts of humanity and of nature. 

“Normative ethical theories vary considerably in terms of their aspirations towards generalization, universality, abstractness, systematic organization, simplicity, and comprehensiveness (Nussbaum 2000, Flynn 2007)…Although most philosophers might naturally think of such highly abstract and ambitious constructions as paradigmatic examples of moral theory, and most likely have precisely such theories in mind when asked about the relationships between bioethics and ethical theory, they do not exhaust the space of normative theorizing either in bioethics or within the moral life more generally.”John Arras, “Theory and Bioethics”, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).
That is, particular religious and social traditions have retained their own account of virtues embedded in the practices and life of those traditions. They have no need of “ethical theory” in the way that a person shipwrecked without a tradition or stranded on a tradition of moral confusion has need of ethical theory. But those of us who belong to the Aristotelian and Christian virtue tradition can, for the benefit of those outside, articulate a theoretical version of the embodied moral life with which we are familiar in the persons of our exemplars. 
	The accounts I will consider differ from each other and my own. But they each contribute to one narrative. That narrative is the origin and growth of a tenable analytic metaethical defense of a particular virtue ethics. 
	My own view (not defended here) is that the normative tenet that we ought to become just, and courageous, and wise, and moderate is an extremely useful and even inspiring law of life. Useful, because there are many paths through life and our heroes may or may not be imitable in the particulars; they may be of a different sex, or a different age, or a different chosen profession, or a different culture, etc. But virtues (or many virtues) are good in a manner that transcends time, place, and culture. And normative virtue ethics are inspiring because our human life is very frail and very fragile, but virtue and wisdom are lasting. Even if the human person does not survive death (as I think it does), the memory of virtuous persons survives death. We remember and celebrate those who achieved exemplary kindness, compassion, justice, fortitude. We even remember and celebrate those who achieved exemplary wit, like Groucho Marx (about whom I’ve never heard an ill word spoken) or exemplary talent, like Leonardo Da Vinci. We remember them for good reason, and celebrate them rightly: because their example is worth following in our own lives. Our longing for immortality, whether ultimately futile or ultimately vindicated, can be channeled into the zealous pursuit of those personal qualities that are universally admired, praised, and commended and into the zealous avoidance of those qualities there universally despised, blamed, and criticized. 
	Believing these things, I want to commend a life of the pursuit of virtue and wisdom to as many as will attend to the use and motivational power of virtue. Reasonable objections may be posed against such a pursuit and such a life. I want to overcome as many reasonable objections as possible. (Unreasonable objections are their own reward.)
	
	So our story begins with Alisdair MacIntyre. To him we will now move. </Text>

            <Text>## Metaethics and Ethics  

### Moore and More Ethics ###

Metaethics in its modern form began with G. E. Moore’s *Principia Ethica*. Of course, the questions that concern modern metaethicists were posed and discussed by prior thinkers. However, the *Principia* gave a distinctive form to these questions and suggested a distinctive range of possible answers. We shall see how Philippa Foot and others dispute the validity of that form and that range. For now, it is better to summarize a bit of Moore’s thinking and the legacy his thinking created. 

Moore argued that all previous ethical philosophers had failed to resolve their disputes for a failure to define their terms. The question of what the word ‘good’ *means* (and, possibly the same question, what ‘good’ *refers to*) is distinct from the question *which things are good?* The first question is a conceptual question that aims to define a category. The second question is a substantive or existential question that aims to bring other concepts within that category. 

Moore argued (or according to some critics, *assumed*) that ‘goodness’ was indefinable. That is, the good could not be defined in terms of any other property. It is false that ‘goodness is pleasure’  or ‘goodness is whatever is most real’. That we pursue pleasure is a psychological claim, not an ethical one; that we judge something to be real is a metaphysical claim, not an ethical one. 

#### G.E. Moore, The Naturalistic Fallacy ####

If the good is indefinable, then any attempt to define it is going to fail. Any attempt to reduce the concept to a concept of lesser intension, or to translate it it as a concept, commits the “naturalistic fallacy.” Moore is clear that the naturalistic fallacy isn’t *just* the error of defining the good as a natural property (such as the pleasant) but also the error of defining the good as a metaphysical or supernatural property (such as the Really Really, or the Divinely-Ordained). 

#### Ethics #### 

Moore’s book comes down from its metaethical heavens back to the normative earth. He argues that whatever is good intrinsically can be known by direct moral perception. Whatever is good instrumentally can be known a posteriori through probabilistic reasoning about causal links between actions and their effects. Whatever necessarily brings about (or tends to bring about) intrinsically good states of affairs is instrumentally good. 

Intrinsic goods, for Moore, are three: aesthetic pleasure, friendship, and knowledge.

#### The Legacy ####

Moore set off a firestorm of debate on this issues. By the account of most of my five key authors, Moore’s legacy is largely a tangent from the deeper philosophical questions within ethics. </Text>

            <Title>A Presumptive Case for Natural Teleology </Title>
            <Text>Is normativity natural? Are normative facts part of nature?  This essay presents a case in the affirmative. To call such a case ‘unpopular’ is an understatement on the level of calling log cabins ‘out of fashion.’ 
Nevertheless, section 1 makes a presumptive argument in favor of natural normativity. Natural normative truths can be expressed in Aristotelian Categorical statements of the form ‘all As φ.’ Such Aristotelian are normative/descriptive statements about normative/descriptive natural facts. Believing such natural normative facts exist is the best explanation of both “teleonomical” phenomena in non-human nature and teleological phenomena in human nature. Simply put, if all eyes see, then there are natural normative facts. And all eyes see. So there are natural normative facts; nature is normative. 
Section 2 replies to a battery of powerful objections to this simple argument. Beyond risking mockery by swimming against such a tide of philosophical orthodoxy, the defender of natural normativity must answer at least five substantive scientific and philosophical objections that frankly seem devastating. Even so, none warrant denying the appearances. Rather, much of the force of these objections comes from the power of suggestion and specious appeals to authority rather than substance. By contrast, the evidence for natural normativity is fairly straightforward, and each thinker can examine it for herself. 

Section 1  — Nature is Normative

Preliminary Assumptions
First, I should say that I take my thesis to be naturalistic in the broad sense: I am using philosophical and broadly scientific methods in an attempt to observe and explain natural phenomena, and bracketing divine revelation or the existence of supernatural beings. Furthermore, my thesis is naturalistic in that one important governing assumption of ethical naturalism is that humans are continuous with nature (Brown 2009). I shall assume rather than argue that if normative facts are real, then they are natural facts. 
Secondly, I shall build my argument on Aristotle, Philippa Foot (2003), and Thomas Nagel (2012). I take my readings of Aristotle and Nagel to be conservative; my reading of Foot, on the other hand, extends a bit farther into metaphysical speculation than she herself (following Wittgenstein) would be interested in going. 
Thirdly, a definitional preliminary: what is a norm or a normative fact? (I shall use the terms interchangeably). A normative fact "is what corresponds to a true normative statement" (Schaber 2012). For reasons of space, I ask you join me in assuming normative realism. 
On normative realism, value-statements, reason-statements, and ought-statements are refer to different normative facts. For example, ”You ought not hit strangers with a skateboard" is a moral statement, but obviously, not every ‘ought’ is a moral ought (Thomson 2001). "You ought to drink some hot lemonade" is a prudential norm (Thomson 2001). Drinking the hot lemonade is something you aspire to, rather than a description of how you are behaving. If you do not, your throat may remain sore. 
Importantly, not every norm explicitly contains the word 'ought'. For example, "Eyes are for seeing," is a description of their function, purpose, or the end-directed activity of that system. "Eyes are for seeing" is a normative and descriptive statement -- that's what eyes do and what they ought to do. Eyes that cannot see are defective qua eye. "Wolves hunt in packs" is a normative and descriptive statement. 
Norms are thus related to teloi, functions, ends, goals, final causes, laws, etc.
By contrast, the denial of actual ends in nature we may call teleological nihilism (Barham 2014). Teleological nihilism comes in two varieties: a weak version affirms that humans engage in end-directed behavior by rational reflection and autonomous choice, but denies natural ends for non-human creatures like wolves or sub-human organs like eyes; a strong version denies even that human behavior that is apparently end-directed is in fact so end-directed.
I have argued above for the weak version. Below is the strong version.


The Structure of the Argument
The basic structure of the argument is this: there are two phenomena, two natural facts, that are best explained by the reality of natural normative facts. If those two natural facts are real, then norms are part of nature — nature is normative. 
Consider the two natural facts: the first is end-directed (teleonomic) behavior of natural entities (eyes see, trees grow, stomachs digest); the second is the essentially normative (teleological) cognitive and practical activity of natural humans. It is of course not as controversial to think that humans act for ends, that we rationally direct our actions. So I shall spend make my case for the more controversial thought that even non-human organisms and organs or body parts (like eyes) are naturally normative.
The best explanation of each of these facts, and of both together, is that nature is normative. We could also say that there are natural teleological laws, natural norms, final causes, natural ends, natural functions, natural goals, etc. 

Aristotelian Categoricals 
Let’s return to the statement, ”Wolves hunt in packs.” This is a statement Foot calls an Aristotelian Categorical (Foot 2002). An Aristotelian categorical's logical form is neither universal nor particular. That is, to assert that all A's φ is not to distribute φ-ing to all members of the category A, nor simply to assert that some A's that we have observed were observed φ-ing. 
For example, "all reptiles lay eggs" as universal categorical statement admits no exceptions.  The discovery of a new reptile, say, that gives live birth would not be the discovery of a defective reptile, but a discovery of a new species of reptile. Or rather, it would mean that either this newly discovered creature is not a reptile or that not all reptiles lay eggs. On the other hand, modestly confining oneself to a particular categorical statement like "some reptiles lay eggs" would be radically unambitious science. Our sample size of reptiles that lay eggs is enormous; we are justified in making the inductive leap that all reptiles lay eggs. 
Aristotelian Categoricals, then, are neither simply universal nor simply particular categorical descriptions. They are normative/descriptive judgments. 
And they are also formed by observation and induction. For example, we observe that many As do indeed φ, and we infer that A is supposed to φ, A is for φ-ing.  Categorical are inductive generalizations with a normative character.  We have observed a sample of A's φ-ing and we inductively infer that (perhaps) all A's φ. 
On the basis of the generalization, the observation that a particular A does not φ does not refute a simply, universal predication but identifies a defect in that particular A. When we observe an exception to a categorical we do not ipso fact debunk our categorical nor are obliged to re-interpret our observation. When learn that all wolves (say) hunt in packs, and observe a wolf hunting alone, we do not debunk the principle that wolves hunt in packs. (Nor do we think that we have discovered a new species of canine that is morphologically and genetically identical to a wolf!) Rather, we have observed that not all wolves are doing what they are supposed to do, not all wolves perfectly exemplify their lifeform.

Nature is Normative: The Presumptive Case 
The presumptive case for natural normativity consists of two short arguments. Argument (A) delivers normative facts from the truth of our normative, the logical structure of Aristotelian Categoricals and the assumed normative realism; argument (B) simply concludes that such normative facts are natural. 
 
	A.	Argument for Normative Facts

	1)	If a normative statement is true, then it corresponds to a normative fact. (Normative realism)
	2)	All eyes see is a true normative statement. (From observation and induction). 
	3)	Therefore, all eyes see corresponds to a normative fact. (From 1-2)

B. Argument for Natural Normative Facts. 

	1)	If a true normative statement is about real, natural entities, then there are natural normative facts. (Naturalism)
	2)	All eyes see is a true normative statement about a natural entity.   (From observation)
	3)	Therefore, there are natural normative facts. (from 1-2)

Argument (A) assumes normative realism for premise 1.  We learn premise 2 from observation and induction: an Aristotelian Categorical descriptive/normative statement: eyes see and eyes are for seeing and eyes ought to see (stomachs are supposed to digest, wolves hunt in packs, humans ought to think rationally, or what have you). (I) delivers conclusion (3), that there are normative facts. Then, argument (B) provides a simple variation on (A). True normative statements about natural entities correspond to real natural facts. Such normative facts are natural and not merely human, psychological, or projected. And (2) is, I take it, obviously normative and about a natural entity (not something man-made). So (B) delivers our thesis, that there are natural normative facts. 

Section 2 — Objections
Let's consider just a few of the many possible powerful objections to this line of thinking. 
The first point is not truly an objection, but a challenge: if the doctrine of natural norms is so unpopular, then it is probably false. If it were true, wouldn't more scientists believe it? More philosophers of science? More philosophers? Well, philosophical fashions come and go. Perhaps this particular fashion of denying natural normativity rests on a mistake. If the arguments like the above are sound, then perhaps natural normativity is destined to become the new, justified, scientific and philosophical orthodoxy. Secondly, for those who care about fashion, Aristotelian cosmology is making a come back. 
	1.	The first substantive objection is that it is false that all eyes see, if taken as a teleological statement like eyes are for seeing or eyes are supposed to see, or eyes are naturally directed toward seeing. Some will say, "Eyes that do not see died out; eyes that see were preserved naturally." 
	0.1.	As far as I can tell, evolutionary backstories about what eyes are and what eyes do has nothing to do with whether they have a real, end-directed function. There is disagreement about whether explanations undermines or underwrites teleological explanations (Mayr 1974, Brown 2009). All that I need for my argument to work is that possibly evolutionary backstories underwrite natural teleology. The only reason to assume that natural selection itself, which produces teleonomic phenomena, is undirected by natural teleology is dogma. If so, call me a heretic. 
	0.2.	But is it really possible to doubt that eyes are for seeing? That eyes see is an empirical observation. That eyes ought to see, that eyes that cannot see are defective, is, I insist, equally empirical. It is just as empirical and no more theory-laden than other scientific observations like "all reptiles lay eggs." 
	0.3.	I save one more response to this objection in the last objection.
	1.	A second objection is to cling to an image. On one very powerful picture of the world, nature is a realm of pure descriptive facts, "bald", "disenchanted," and physical (McDowell 1996). Nature is an interlocking system of relations, spatial, temporal, and causal. Nature is "the world of quantity, as against the world of quality; of objects as against consciousness... of efficient causes (or, in some modern systems, of no causality at all) as against final causes." (Lewis 1947). Call this the Laplacian picture (Plantinga 2011). On this picture which arrogates itself as the scientific picture, norms are final causes, teloi, ways, and hence must be merely psychological or belief in them is unscientific. 
	1.1.	By all means, let us be scientific. I have an unwavering pro-attitude toward whatever earns the honorific title of science. If teleological laws are not discovered by scientific methods, then normative facts remain mere hypotheses or pragmatic assumptions or unshakable illusions. But the fact that eyes really are for seeing is evidence against the Laplacian picture of the world and hence the Laplacian monopoly on the term ‘science.’ That eyes are for seeing supports rather the Aristotelian picture of nature as including all four causes, and science as studying all four. Hence, natural normativity is scientific, and its denial is unscientific. Natural normativity is even empirical, and its denial is dogmatically unempirical.  
	2.	A third objection. The existence of natural teleology depends heavily on inferences to the best explanation. But "best" explanation depends in part on background beliefs. If one of our background beliefs is that we believe on good inductive evidence from scientific methods, that there are no natural norms, then appeal to normative facts to explain apparent normative truths like "eyes are for seeing" is blocked. So, on best scientific methods, we must deny the appearances: either normative realism is false, or normative natural facts are merely descriptive with the illusion of normativity. 
	2.1.	This objection may be taken two ways, and both are refutable: Firstly, it might be using the locution "scientific methods" but referring to a philosophical doctrine, namely, the dogma that Laplacian nature is not normative. Well, I deny the dogma on the basis of the Presumptive Case above. Secondly, this objection might mean that inference to the best explanation (IBE) is not a part-and-parcel of the scientific method.  But it is. Scientists do use inference to the best explanation (abduction, hypotheses, explanation). It is, as far as I can tell, the reason we believe in electrons (Enoch 2009). IBE is in fact, ineliminable part of the scientific method. 
	2.2.	IBE the kind of inference we used. The explanation of teleological phenomena (by teleological laws) may be wrong but it is not in the wrong ball park. It may be unscientific in the sense any false datum or theorem is unscientific. But it is not non-scientific the way Cinderella movies or street lights are non-scientific.
	3.	A fourth, and also very different objection. Stephen Brown objects that arguments from an observation that A φ's to the conclusion that A ought to φ prove too much, since it can be applied not only to non-humans but to non-living things. For example, we could "prove" that our hydrogen star is for radiating energy to the earth; the sun engenders life so therefore it is supposed to engender life. But this seems absurd: the sun does not have a purpose, a natural normativity. This is an objection about scope: if there are norms in terrestrial nature, do they extend to the whole cosmos? My presumptive case argues are really real and really natural but may be taken to prove only that norms exist for organic natural entities.
	3.1.	On the one hand, I am perfectly content to rest my case. If I have persuaded you of a more modest conclusions, that normative laws obtain only in humans; or they obtain only in living organisms, or even more ambitiously, that they obtain only in organic systems (both organisms and their organs). 
	3.2.	On the other hand, Thomas Nagel (2012) makes the case in Mind and Cosmos that teleological (and hence normative) laws are natural to the cosmos as a whole, including inorganic matter. 
	3.3.	I think there are two good reasons to be maximally ambitious about natural normativity. They are both reductios: suppose that there are natural normative facts about only organic entities, not non-living entities like the soil and the sun. Then we must affirm that when life appeared on earth, a new kind of case appeared as well: final causes. A new natural fact that was never there before, normative natural facts appear. For 13 billion years prior, there was only chance and efficient/material causes. Suddenly, and accidentally, the universe produced not only a new entity but a new kind of fact: normative facts. This sounds to me absurd, though if it does not sound so to you, I'm not sure how to persuade you otherwise. It makes more sense, I think, to suppose that natural normativity was there from the Big Bang forward. 
	3.4.	A second reductio: In the first objection, we considered that natural selection undermines the appearance of teleology. The problem is that natural selection does not apply to inorganic entities and systems like the soil, the sun, and the stars. There is no interstellar process analogous to genetic drift and the extinction of maladaptive traits. This also sounds to me absurd. The alternative, then, is more likely true: natural norms just are features of all of nature. Teleological normative laws are another brute kind of natural laws. 
	4.	A fifth and final objection. Some will take this whole argument, which began assuming normative realism, and concluded with normative natural laws, as a reductio ad absurdum about normative realism. What better expression of why we should be norm-expressivists like Alan Gibbard? Normativity is only “natural” to humans, not to all of nature. We, as a species, are different from all of Laplacian nature, capable of advanced cognition and practice. So why not just explain the appearance of natural norms, of final causes, of purposes, of natural ends, by a combination natural selection and human projection? We are projecting our insides onto nature's insides. When really, nature has no "inside," no subjectivity, no consciousness. 
	4.1.	Strangely enough, such an explanation divorces humanity from nature. It makes humans mysterious, radically discontinuous, opaque, anomalous, and queer. Since I am here assuming that humans are continuous with nature, I reject an account of teleology that makes it natural only to humans but unnatural to the cosmos as a whole. Furthermore, I have studiously avoided using too many uncontroversial examples of human normativity, preferring the more controversial (and hence more interesting) examples of non-human normative facts.

Implications for Metaethics
What is particularly exciting to me about natural normativity, if it is true, is its implication for ethics. If non-human stuff of the cosmos (quasars and comets) and the human stuff of the cosmos (you and me) share a common normative structure, then this might be what underwrites many ethical claims.
 Julia Annas puts it this way:  "What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already..." (Annas 2005).
 Natural normativity underwrites the belief that non-human nature and human nature share a common structure. This is just what ethical naturalism predicts. Ethical living is when we aim to become what we ought to become. Promise-keeping, rationality, prudence, moderation, perseverance, can be plausibly presented as traits that enable us to become what we are already are and what we ought to be. </Text>

### Moore and More Ethics ###

Metaethics in its modern form began with G. E. Moore’s *Principia Ethica*. Of course, the questions that concern modern metaethicists were posed and discussed by prior thinkers. However, the *Principia* gave a distinctive form to these questions and suggested a distinctive range of possible answers.

The question of what the word ‘good’ *means* (and, possibly the same question, what ‘good’ *refers to*) is distinct from the question *which things are good?* The first question is a conceptual question that aims to define a category. The second question is a substantive or existential question that aims to bring other concepts within that category. 

Moore argued (or according to some critics, *assumed*) that ‘goodness’ was indefinable. That is, the good could not be defined in terms of any other property. It is false that ‘goodness is pleasure’  or ‘goodness is whatever is most real’. That we pursue pleasure is a psychological claim, not an ethical one; that we judge something to be real is a metaphysical claim, not an ethical one. 

#### G.E. Moore, The Naturalistic Fallacy ####

If the good is indefinable, then any attempt to define it is going to fail. Any attempt to reduce the concept to a concept of lesser intension, or to translate it it as a concept, commits the “naturalistic fallacy.” Moore is clear that the naturalistic fallacy isn’t *just* the error of defining the good as a natural property (such as the pleasant) but also the error of defining the good as a metaphysical or supernatural property (such as the Really Really, or the Divinely-Ordained). 

#### Ethics #### 

Moore’s book comes down from its metaethical heavens back to the normative earth. He argues that whatever is good intrinsically can be known by direct moral perception. Whatever is good instrumentally can be known a posteriori through probabilistic reasoning about causal links between actions and their effects. Whatever necessarily brings about (or tends to bring about) intrinsically good states of affairs is instrumentally good. 

Intrinsic goods, for Moore, are three: aesthetic pleasure, friendship, and knowledge.

#### The Legacy ####

Moore set off a firestorm of debate on this issues. By the account of most of my five key authors, Moore’s legacy is largely a tangent from the deeper philosophical questions within ethics. 

## Neo-Aristotelian Virtue Ethics? ##

I would like to explore one further reason for studying just these four virtue ethicists together. Stating this reason requires taking a bit of a detour. I think the detour will address (if not diffuse) a potential worry about the relation between normative ethics and metaethics. 

In recognition of their approach to philosophical ethics, most of these virtue ethicists are also classified as "neo-Aristotelians" with respect to metaethics. There are two important metaphilosophical confusions lurking behind these innocuous distinctions. 

To begin to see the confusions, consider the way James Lenman summarizes neo-Aristotelianism as a version of "moral naturalism":

&gt;One important school of thought ... [is] work is inspired by that of Aristotle. This view has its roots in the writings of G. E. M. Anscombe, P. T. Geach and the early Philippa Foot among others. Its contemporary representatives include the later Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum and Judith Jarvis Thomson. As this list makes clear, this is very much the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics. [@sepmoralnaturalism. Lenman acknowledges that Thomson might need to be subtracted from this list and that John McDowell might need to be added.]

Lenman does not quite know what to do with neo-Aristotelian naturalism. The first confusing fact is the close tie between neo-Aristotelian naturalism and virtue theory.  Lenman seems bemused when he says that neo-Aristotelianism "the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics."  For when Foot, Hursthouse, McDowell are classified as virtue ethicists (a normative theory) *and* neo-Aristotelians (a metaethical theory), we might object.  Aren't these two different projects? One legacy of G.E. Moore's *Principia Ethica* has been the tendency to sharply distinguish primary ethical questions (about what things are good) from metaethical questions (about what 'good' as an evaluative predicate *means*). 

The second is an uncertainty with respect to who actually deserves the title of "naturalists". Lenman is not sure who counts, pointing out in a footnote that Thomson probably shouldn't be on this list and that John McDowell probably should. He says "McDowell is certainly pervasively inspired by Aristotle and he describes himself as a naturalist. See especially his 1995. But I suspect many philosophers would find his use of the term  'naturalist' here somewhat Pickwickian."[@sepmoralnaturalism]  The confusion arises because Lenman and others[@rehg2003conceptual; @hacker2009natural; @hacker2009human] are not sure that neo-Aristotelian "naturalism" is "really *naturalism*" at all. 

Both of these confusions reflect deep fault lines in contemporary philosophical ethics. In brief, the fault line separates two contrary ways of understanding what *nature* is. Put differently, the fault line separates two ways of understanding the fact/value dichotomy.[@putnam2002collapse] 

Aristotle and the broad Aristotelian tradition deny that the fact-value dichotomy is absolute. They conceive of *nature* as including everything that *is and ought to be.* Briefly, for Moore nature as including everything that *is* but not what ought to be -- all facts, no values. Moore and those influenced by him, both naturalists and non-naturalists, have agreed with the underlying assumption that "nature" is purely descriptive. But what if this assumption is mistaken? Surely we cannot let a deeply-held assumption stand without scrutiny. For Aristotle, nature is some facts, some values. So norms and prescriptions can be just as natural as facts and descriptions. If normativity (*what ought to be*) is natural too, then it might be possible that *human nature* grounds ethical facts. And this is just what virtue ethics says. 

The two questions above (about whether neo-Aristotelians are truly "naturalists" and the close tie between neo-Aristotelian metaethics and normative virtue ethics) have the same answer: Aristotle's ethics and his metaphysics (of biology and nature) cannot be easily extricated from each other. The same goes for neo-Aristotelians. There is a tight fit -- perhaps an inextricable tie -- between Aristotelian virtue theory and the metaethical view labeled neo-Aristotelian naturalism. And neo-Aristotelian naturalists argue that nature is or can be normative. Talking as if the fact-value dichotomy is *not* ultimate makes the other sort of naturalist squirm.

Now, non-Aristotelians might just double down and insist that metaethical theory is utterly procedural and not substantive -- they might insist that it is utterly neutral with respect to normative ethical theories. Certainly this is the most widespread belief. 

Nevertheless, two responses are possible: first, we might seriously doubt this alleged neutrality. For example, we might notice the conspicuous connection between supposedly "neutral" metaethics and first-order consequentialism: G.E. Moore, J.L. Mackie, Frank Jackson, Richard Boyd, Peter Railton, Simon Blackburn, and Alan Gibbard all endorse consequentialism. (We might even echo Lenman and call moral naturalism the "official theory of a main current in contemporary consequentialism.") 

Secondly, even if a procedural, non-substantive approach to metaethics can be made neutral with respect to normative ethics, it is still admirably ambitious to construct a theory that pays attention to both. Darwall agrees. His (2003) essay summarizes the history of analytic ethics since Moore, and persuasively argues "that although metaethics and normative ethics are properly focused on different issues, they need to be brought into dynamic relation with one another in order to produce a systematic and defensible philosophical ethics. This mutual dependence is owing to the fact that issues of normativity are at the center of the concerns of both metaethics and normative ethics."[@darwall2003should] I might add that issues of normativity *and nature* are at the center of concerns about both. 

These are deep waters. Suffice it to say, for now, that I think Darwall is right here: Moore's legacy is not the last word on the relation between the semantic and metaphysical foundations of moral terms and concepts and the substantive normative questions. And these four tend to agree. Foot and MacIntyre, for instance, begin their books by criticizing Moore for his erroneous starting points. They may all be wrong, but they are on a page together. 

 And that is one of the major reasons for selecting these four for dissertation-length study. They are sure to provide excellent fodder for study in their own right, and also provide a gateway into further research and writing on some of these deeper relations between disenchanted nature and "re-enchanted" nature, between and virtue, between humanity and human excellence.</Text>

            <Title>A Presumptive Case for Moral Realism</Title>
            <Text>The philosophical ethics presented in these pages aims to be a species of moral realism and moral objectivism inextricable from normative virtue theory. 
Of course, defending moral realism from its objectors would be the task of another book. The ethical writer of the early 21st century is fortunate to be able to stand on the shoulders of Russ Scaeffer-Landau, Terrence Cuneo, and David Enoch. In this section I did not attend anything like a defensive moral realism against all devils advocates, nor a complete summary of the arguments of these three writers. Rather, I use a few of what I take to be there most incisive arguments to form a presumptive case in favor of moral realism. This presumption, while not invincible, will be enough to form a foundation for a debate that more fervently animates virtue theorists: the debate between subjectivist realism (constructivism) and objectivist realism (“robust realism” (Enoch 2011), “stance-independent” realism (Shafer-Landau 2003)). That debate I enter in the chapters on Hursthouse and McDowell. 
The presumptive case is a simple abduction: Our moral discourse has “objective purport”. All people, everywhere, for all of recorded history, argue over right and wrong. The best explanation of this is that the real moral facts and genuine moral truths d exist but are hard to discover.  For we do not argue over purely subjective matters: “I like mint ice cream.” “No, you don’t!” And we do not argue over objective matters that are easy. “That book weighs five pounds.” “No, I just weighed it on this reliable scale: it’s 4 pounds.” “Oh!” We argue over objective matters that are difficult, like the most fair and most effective method of gathering taxes from a population, or the permissibility of aborting fetuses. 
The objections to moral realism often begin with an aporia regarding disagreement. But how is moral disagreement a problem for moral realism? David Enoch’s delightfully Socratic question stops us in our tracks. To answer this question by simply asserting “it isn’t” seems strange and bold and daring in today’s moral milieu. But it isn’t. People give conflicting and mutually incompatible answers to objective questions all the time in physics, in evolutionary biology, in computer science, in every day life. If both parties can’t both be right, then one or both parties are mistaken. If party A thinks taxes should be a flat 14.4% rate gathered from everyone, and pay B thinks taxes should be an ascending rate from 8%-35% depending on income, then, all else being equal, either one is mistaken (the other being right) or both are mistaken (and some third thesis is correct). 
That we should allow this presumption to have some weight in our inquiry needs some defense. Virtue theory is perhaps the oldest kind of ethical theory, taking ethical theory to be a reflection upon and rarified version of ordinary, commonsense traditional morality. The virtues ethicists defend are not automatic social norms promoted and defended, knee-jerk-like. But neither are the virtues they defend pulled whole out of Plato’s heaven, abstract, pure, and unconnected to upbringing in a family, society, and tradition. Rather, the virtues defended are polished, trimmed, versions of the raw material supplied by family, society, and tradition. 
Moral disagreement arises in cultures whose entire moral traditions are at odds. Moral traditions include forms of life encompassing education, the value placed on family (child-bearing and child-rearing), a notion of what are social goods, a notion of what counts as success, and a definition of death. Moral traditions arise from, I would guess, a variety of factors, but to speculate on that origination is beyond me. Within moral traditions, relationships are characterized by an astonishing degree of moral agreement. In 1920</Text>

Outline of Chapter and rest of dissertation. </Synopsis>
            <Text>In this chapter, I advance my view. My metaethical theory is a positive version of virtue ethics that provides strong explanatory power over a range of phenomena of human thought, action, and speech. In short, it explains the explananda laid out in the previous chapter. 

Virtue ethics (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. 

Recall the four criteria: practical reason, objective purport of evaluative discourse, seemingly incorrigible normative foundation knowledge, the unity and diversity of goods, the unity and diversity of human goodness, group and individual human goodness, and superlative human goodness. 

Virtue ethics explains all these in a satisfying account of nature and human nature. 

After hearing my account, readers will likely have one of three reactions.
Ssome readers will be tempted to argue some of the explananda that aren’t explained by the objector’s preferred theory need explaining away. My reply will be to revisit arguments from Chapter 1. I point out that each explanandum is a common, obvious, public phenomenon that calls for explanation — and the explaining away had better be more plausible than the explanation. But the best way to ‘explain away’ these phenomena is to affirm that our normative talk is massively mistaken in some way. For such nihilists, a safe course of action is to put the book down and read something else. 

The second is likely to be that my virtue theory is just fine but another theory could explain the facts too. 
My reply will consume chapter 3. In short, other theories could account for them; virtue theory just accounts for them more and more satisfyingly. 

The third objection is that the theory laid out is not sufficiently naturalistic. This is the objection that I will concede has apparent force. I will make it even more clearly and strongly in chapter 4, clarify its terms in chapter 5, and answer it in chapter 6.  </Text>

            <Title>### Elizabeth Anscombe, Moral Psychology?</Title>
            <Text>“Teleological ethics” was taken, especially a decade or two ago, to contrast with deontological ethics and to refer to utilitarianism.[@louden1984vices 227] Teleology then means simply that the utilitarian aims to achieve some end — happiness, pleasure, utility, or what have you. Thus understood, virtue theorists seem to be utilitarians whose primary concern is the character of moral agents rather than the acts moral agents perform or the rules they obey. But this is a misunderstanding. 

Teleological ethics of the sort that concerns Anscombe (and concerns us in these chapters) is not a matter of a posteriori, statistical analyses of character traits or actions or rules and their respective consequences aimed at reliably hitting the target by consistently bringing about the cause. Teleological ethics is about unfolding the inner form of a thing; actualizing its inherent or intrinsic telos. This process of self-realization occurs in all living things, from the smallest bacterium to the largest whale. It does not (at least I shall assume it does not) occur in any non-living thing; there is no teleological, goal-oriented process guiding the development of new solar systems or the destructions of old ones; there is no “cosmic ecology” because there is no cosmic ecosystem. The cosmic relation between star and asteroid is more akin to the terrestrial relation between gas and matter than the terrestrial relation between bear and butterfly.

            <Title>Wielenberg, Erik, A Defense of Non-Theistic Moral Realism</Title>
            <Text>This philosophers rather interesting little paper pugnaciously picks a fight with William Ln., Craig, JP Moreland, and other theistic philosophers who attack easiest of morality on the grounds that it cannot provide anyfirm foundation for objective morality.

So for instance William Craig criticizes his opponents in debate for correctly affirming that rape is wrong, but being unable to go further and give an account of why it is wrong.

 This philosophers defense is clever. It amounts to affirming that there are brute ethical facts, non-natural and that do not stand in need of further justification. Against theistic complaints, he shows that they too except brute ethical fact.  So his moral realism is formally identical, but materially different from their moral realism.

The theist  argues that his moral realism is less arbitrary. This philosopher argues that they are equally arbitrary. So the only way to adjudicate between the two is on the basis of independent arguments for and against the existence of God.

The upshot is that this philosopher has rendered atheistic moral realism no less possible then it's theistic counterpart. 

I think his conclusion mostly right. There is no intellectual compulsion to accept a further theistic explanation of the agreed upon brute or almost brute moral facts.

The theistic explanation is slightly more plausible than its atheistic rival , if we remain agnostic about theism. If we assume atheism of course then the theistic explanation is not "less likely " but simply false. 

So the question is how is moral realism supposed to support beleif in God or how is beleif on god supposed to be justified apart from considerations about hardcore moral realism?

In this paper I explain and defend a view that might be given the catchy title non-natural non-theistic moral realism.4 It is a version of moral realism in that it implies that there exist ethical facts that are objective in the sense just explained. It is non-natural in that it implies that ethical facts and properties are not reducible to natural facts and properties. And it is non-theistic in that it implies that objective morality does not require a theistic foundation; indeed, the view implies that objective morality does not require an external foundation at all. In calling the view non-theistic I do not mean to imply that the view entails atheism; the view is compatible with theism as well as atheism. But it does imply that there are objective ethical facts even if atheism is true.

Of the ethical states of affairs that obtain necessarily, at least some are brute facts.15 That pain is intrinsically bad is not explained in terms of other states of affairs that obtain. Moreover, at least some necessarily obtaining brute ethical facts are not trivial but substantive.16 Therefore, I have an ontological commitment shared by many theists: I am committed to the obtaining of substantive, metaphysically necessary, brute facts. Some ethical facts fall into this category; I call such facts basic ethical facts. Such facts are the foundation of (the rest of) objective morality and rest on no foundation themselves. To ask of such facts, “where do they come from?” or “on what foundation do they rest?” is misguided in much the way that, according to many theists, it is misguided to ask of God, “where does He come from?” or “on what foundation does He rest”? The answer is the same in both cases: They come from nowhere, and nothing external to themselves grounds their existence; rather, they are fundamental features of the universe that ground other truths.17

What is the connection between the natural fact that an action is a piece of deliberate cruelty—say, causing pain just for fun—and the moral fact that it is wrong? It cannot be an entailment, a logical or semantic necessity. Yet is it not merely that the two features occur together. The wrongness must somehow be ‘consequential’ or ‘supervenient’; it is wrong because it is a piece of deliberate cruelty. But just what in the world is signified by this ‘because’?

For what it is worth, the ethical claim that pain is intrinsically bad seems to me not to cry out for further explanation; indeed, I find it less in need of explanation than the existence of a perfect person who created the universe.

Still, even if not all non-trivial necessary ethical facts need external explanations, it might be suggested that a theory that can explain such facts is, all else equal, superior to a theory that cannot explain them. This observation points toward another possible reason to prefer a theistic approach to my own. Wainwright suggests that at least some theistic approaches can explain the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral and that this feature of such approaches gives them an advantage over theories (like mine) that cannot offer a deeper explanation for the su- pervenience. Wainwright points to Robert Adams’s theory in Finite and Infinite Goodsas an example of a theistic approach that offers a deeper explanation for the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral. However, it turns out that Adams’s theory, like mine, entails the existence of brute ethical facts. To see this, we must examine some of the details of Adams’s view.

Adams’s claim that the Good = God is modeled after another identity claim: that water = H2O. One interesting feature of this second identity claim is that it is not true by definition; the meaning of the word ‘water’ includes nothing about its chemical composition, as shown by the fact that people used the word ‘water’ perfectly competently before the rise of modern chemistry. One lesson to be drawn from this example is that meaning of a given term does not always reveal the full nature of the thing to which the term

Craig and Moreland criticize this view as follows: 
It is difficult, however, even to comprehend this view. What does it mean to say, for example, that the moral value justice just exists? It is hard to know what to make of this. It is clear what is meant when it is said that a person is just; but it is bewildering when it is said that in the absence of any people, justice itself exists. Moral values seem to exist as properties of persons, not as mere abstractions—or at any rate, it is hard to know what it is for a moral value to exist as a mere abstraction. Atheistic moral realists seem to lack any adequate foundation in reality for moral values but just leave them floating in an unintelligible way.43 

This passage suggests a number of objections to atheistic moral realism. It should be noted that some of these objections would tell against a view like that of Adams. This is problematic for Craig and Moreland, as they routinely turn to Adams to handle objections to their own theistic version of moral realism.44 One objection suggested here is based on the principle that all values are properties of persons. Adams’s view violates this principle in identifying the Good with God; the Good, a value, is declared to be not a property of a person but rather an actual person.45 Another objection suggested by this passage is that all values must have a foundation and cannot simply “float.” If the idea is that values must be anchored in something external to themselves, then Adams’s view also violates this principle. As noted in the previous section, Adams’s view implies that at least one value (the Good) has no external foundation.

is worth noting here that “accidental” must be understood as synonymous with “not a result of intentional design” but not with “a result of entirely random processes.” According to contemporary evolutionary theory, evolutionary processes are not, contrary to popular mischaracterizations, entirely chance-driven. Rather, they are driven by a combination of chance and necessity; see Ernst Mayr, What Evolution Is (New York: Basic Books, 2001), pp. 119–120.

In light of this, one can perhaps forgive the non-theistic moral realist for being somewhat underwhelmed by the argument that endorsing that there is a being worthy of worship as a basic ethical fact is less arbitrary than, say, endorsing that pleasure is an intrinsic good as a basic ethical fact. If Craig and Moreland’s support for the premise that the existence of objective ethical facts requires the existence of God boils down to the claim that (a)–(c) are less arbitrary than (d)–(f), then their moral argument for the existence of God is on shaky ground indeed.

            <Title>6. **Justification of Morality Objection.**</Title>
            <Text>6. **Justification of Morality Objection.** 

I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection, which he points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*, which I shall discuss in a later chapter.

##### Will I discuss it in a later chapter? If not remove that sentence. 

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is that the “why be moral?” question is never asked in the abstract. The person who succeeds in sincerely asking it, if that person is not a hypothetical thought experiment in a piece of philosophical writing, then that person is by definition an outcast from their own society. The emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The polis to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the polis which belongs to him. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” simply do not arise. 

If we specify the immoralist, we can identify at least three particular types. 

The first let’s call the inert. The inert has no reasons for acting and no (sub-rational) impulses whatsoever and so does not act at all. Bartleby the Scrivener is an example of the inert. Possibly, Nietzsche by the end of his life had succumbed to mental illness of this kind. (For though mental illness is not intelligible to the mentally ill, it may be intelligible to the mentally stable.) The inert cannot reflect upon his maxims of action nor give account of them because he has lost the motivation even to think or speak. 

The second let’s call the irrationalist. The irrationalist has no reasons for acting whatsoever, but does have sub-rational impulses that cause him to move about. Frost in C. S. Lewis’ novel That Hideous Strength is an example. This person has become a beast. Beast has a negative connotation. ‘Beast’ connotes a “lower animal” and somehow less valuable than a human. In this context, I mean both: a human beast is someone who has become a lower than human animal and such a person is defective qua human. The irrationalist cannot summon an account of his reasons for action because, ex hypothesis, he *has* none. When asked he would only grunt, squawk, or burble. 

The third let’s call the immoralist. The immoralist has reasons for acting but denies or renounces *some* worthwhile reasons for acting. They are *inconsistent* but not irrational. Thrasymachus may be such a type. The immoralist can reflect — even intelligently reflect — upon his maxims for action and can give *an* account; but will only do so if it seems good to do so by his own immoralist principles. In other words, a consistent egoist will not preach egoism unless it advances his own self-interest; he will not preach egoism for the sake of the listener, for that would be to give up his egoism. The aesthete pleasure-lover will not take a break from wanton revelry to preach indulgence unless he happens to (also) enjoy preaching as much as wanton revelry. The immoralist is not the person who has no practical reasons; it is the person who has too few practical reasons. 

The fourth let’s call the incoherent. The incoherent, while he claims to have reasons for acting, does not act on *those* maxims but on different ones. When called upon to give account of his reasons for action, he will summon maxims that apparently bear no relation to the ones upon which he acts. Sunday in G. K. Chesterton’s The Man Who Was Thursday is perhaps a type of such a character. </Text>

First, an interlocutor might wonder what is the point of all this emphasis on *tradition* and *rationality* in developing an account of *virtue*.  This question assumes a sharp distinction between *morality* and *rationality* and hence assumes the further distinction between a theory of *moral virtue* and a theory of rationality. To answer this, we must examine one of MacIntyre’s later and more mature works, which we will do in the next section. 

Secondly, an interlocutor might wonder which of MacIntyre’s concepts of ’virtue’ is the primary sense of virtue?  This question assumes that Aristotle’s conception of virtue is at least consistent — virtues are acquired human qualities (habits) that contribute to (and are at least partially constitutive of) eudaimonia, where all humans are understood to have *one* numerally identical end. 

On MacIntyre’s account, Aristotle’s view of eudaimonia is fatally flawed: it universalizes a particular, local, upper-class Athenian male view of human eudaimonia. Thus debunked, it is unclear whether MacIntyre wishes to replace Aristotle’s aspiration for a universal definition of happiness with a *different* universal aspiration or to reject the universal aspiration altogether. 

Instead, he discusses those qualities that contribute to the good internal to a practice are certainly skills, “know-how”, technical knowledge or what have you. But not all practices contribute to human flourishing.  Grand theft, torture, etc., are contrary to other virtues (respect for private property, kindness). Other practices can be plausibly seen as value-neutral (table tennis?). Therefore, not all MacIntyrean virtues qualify as Aristotelian virtues, in the sense that many assume virtues are beneficial to their possessor.

It seems that MacIntyre’s account of virtue doesn’t even get off the ground because what qualities count as virtues are relative *not only* to practices but to traditions and one’s narrative conception of life. 

This account seems relativistic. Happiness, eudaimonia, “the” singular human telos is relative to traditions. MacIntyre can only avoid this by arguing that some traditions are, as a whole, importantly mistaken. And this is what he does argue. 

The first question above is about the relation of rationality to tradition; the second about the relation of virtues to traditions. Both elicit an important response: one’s conception of *both* rationality *and* virtue are relative to one’s tradition. And if traditions are incommensurable to each other, it seems that we are left with tradition-based relativism. 

I return to this objection in Section 2 below.

Thomas Nagel and Martha Nussbaum question MacIntyre’s conclusions — and even his rationality — by imprecating his motives. They worry that somehow or other, religious or pragmatic motivations have infected his philosophical discourse. They suggest that he has abandoned reason in favor of something irrational. The irrational substitute is either faith, or psychological fear of chaos and neurotic attachment to certainty and order. 

Stephen Lutz responds to these criticisms. He points out that they ironically play into MacIntyre’s hands. They prove that Nagel and Nussbaum are, in this matter, motivated by hidebound prejudice to surrender to irrationality. </Text>

6. **Justification of Morality Objection.** I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection, which he points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*, which I shall discuss in a later chapter.

#### Will I discuss it in a later chapter? If not remove that sentence.  ###

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is that the “why be moral?” question is never asked in the abstract. The person who succeeds in sincerely asking it, if that person is not a hypothetical thought experiment in a piece of philosophical writing, then that person is by definition an outcast from their own society. The emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The polis to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the polis which belongs to him. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” simply do not arise.

            <Title>Darwinism</Title>
            <Text>Brown’s “Really Naturalizing Virtue” not only aims to satisfy the demanding criteria of naturalism with a robust account of virtues that satisfies the criterion of being a virtue theory.  As he says, “However, in examining the theory we are led to a more modest understanding of what the ambitions of this kind of ethical naturalism ought to be” (1). The success is not monolithic — he concedes that our account of virtue is not able to satisfy all the demands of naturalism without giving up on (a) virtue theory’s most common “decision theory”, its most common way of offering action guidance, and (b) the substantive view of rationality in which practical reason by definition aims at a good or the good (rather than, a la Hume, aiming at anything). 

Some key quotes:
“One argument in favor of naturalized virtue ethics, from a naturalistic perspective, is that the theory is consistent with neo-Darwinism. Our naturalistic ethical theory—whatever form it might eventually take—must be consistent with neo-Darwinism, the best explanation we have of genetic diversity and functional complexity in the organic world. Furthermore, although I will only outline such a case here, a case could be made that, if neo-Darwinism is true, a prediction of that theory is that something like naturalized virtue ethics ought to be our logic of evaluation, using ‘ought’ in its purely predictive sense. That is, if our natural, ultimate end is reproductive success (or, alternatively put, genetic proliferation), then we would expect that we would have a psychological tendency to valorize those traits that reliably enable realization of that end. Such a logic of evaluation would, as it were, sew the seeds of its own success, as long as it had a genetic base. Also, we might predict that this logic of evaluation would tend to praise itself, that is, would tend to valorize its own existence. From a purely neo-Darwinian perspective, the ultimate function of any gene is to secure its own continued existence. That it could do so, ceteris paribus, explains why it is here.
“All this is, of course, speculative. Determining that something like naturalized virtue ethics represents our evolved logic of evaluation is a complicated empirical issue. Nevertheless, these considerations explain, if naturalized virtue ethics is our evaluative logic, why it is our logic. Even if it is our logic, however, that fact would not entail that the logic is correct. Just because it is our logic does not mean that it ought to be. Of course, if it is the only logic that can be ours, due to our evolved psychology, it follows that—given that ‘ought implies ‘can’—no other logic of evaluation is a plausible candidate. 
“One advantage this theory has over related theories is that its explicit acceptance of evolutionary theory allows its proponents to provide a principled, naturalistic explanation for why certain ends are our natural ends. Quite simply, they evolved to be so. On Hursthouse’s account, it looks like an open question whether a unifying theoretical account can be provided to explain why those things get onto the list of ends and thus are called ‘good’, except to say that they are our ends. The same goes for a theory like Foot’s, where eudaimonia or flourishing is taken to be our natural end. In Aristotle’s terms, we call the ends ‘good’ just because they are our ends, that for which we aim and strive, and it seems thatnofurtherexplanationofthegoodnessoftheseendscanbegiven.25 Itisnotthattheendsareself- justifying but rather that they are not the kind of thing in need of justification. This, of course, leaves the ends themselves—if they truly are our ends—immune to rational criticism. 
Some naturalized virtue ethicists, including Foot, Hursthouse, and perhaps Aristotle, think that we can arrive at an account of the ends through observation or human ethology. There is, of course, some room to argue about whether these are our natural ends. For the neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalist, that argument forms part of the ethical discourse. However, for the naturalist the argument takes place in a court into which has been introduced a cold, hard theoretical fact. The ultimate end of all complex biological traits is individual survival and continuance of the species or genotype, because those traits having served those ends in the past explains why those traits currently exist.26  The theory I am presenting here, as opposed to Hursthouse’s or Foot’s variants, can explain why what we take to be natural ends are our natural ends: our dispositional evaluative tendencies evolved that way, in fact, were selected by nature to be that way. We have a well-established theory—neo-Darwinism—that makes certain predictions about what human beings will take to be important, that is, will take as ends to be pursued. We observe whether those predictions come true. None of this means, of course, that reproductive success is good. Thus, my version of naturalized virtue ethics is in more or less the same boat as any other such teleological theory. But such is the ethical limit of this kind of theory. Even if it is “our” logic, it does not follow that it is the right one to have. 
Naturalized virtue ethics, then, is not a “decision theory,” nor is it intended as a prescriptive ethical theory. It does not tell you what you ought to do. It is a theory about an important mode of ethical evaluation. We could look at an oak tree, for example, and see that, given what we know about oak trees, it would be a better oak tree if it had more water. But it does not follow that we ought to water it. The same thing goes for our evaluations of human beings. Even if we can look at someone and judge that he would be better off—in the sense of being a better human being—if he had courage, nothing follows directly about what I or anyone else ought to do in regards to him, nor what the state should do. There is an ‘is’-‘ought’ gap, as it were, forevermore. However, I or anyone else can judge the coward as, say, a middling human being. Moreover, we evaluate someone’s actions insofar as they are evidence of someone’s character. We do not directly, in naturalized virtue ethics, evaluate actions. Even a good human being can do things that are bad or wrong. The question is whether he or she does such things consistently and from a settled disposition.”
(Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue”, 11-12) 

“…we can see that Foot’s naturalism offers a fresh approach to objectivism in ethics. Yet, in spite of such attractions, Natural Goodness is in the midst of a cool reception. Here, I will argue that this reception is due to the fact that Foot’s naturalism draws on a picture of the biological world that is at odds with the view embraced by most contemporary scientists and philosophers. Foot’s readers commonly assume that the account of the biological world that she must want to adhere to, and that she nevertheless mistakenly departs from, is the account offered by contemporary neo-Darwinian biological sciences.” (Wright, “What is Natural about Foot’s Naturalism?” 309).  @Hacker2009natural %</Text>

            <Title>#### Primary Virtue Objection</Title>
            <Text>### Objections ###

#### Primary Virtue Objection

First, an objection that amounts to an interpretive challenge. It simply asks: Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of ’virtue’ is the primary sense of virtue? Aristotle’s conception of virtue is that virtues are acquired human qualities (habits) that contribute to (and are at least partially constitutive of) eudaemonia. Those qualities that contribute to the good internal to a practice are certainly skills, “know-how”, technical knowledge or what have you. But not all practices contribute to human flourishing.  Grand theft, torture, etc., are contrary to other virtues (respect for private property, kindness). Other practices can be plausibly seen as value-neutral (table tennis?). Therefore, not all MacIntyrean virtues qualify as Aristotelian virtues, in the sense that many assume virtues are beneficial to their possessor. 

#### Primary Virtue Objection Reply

Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of virtue is the primary sense? I would disagree that virtues enable an agent to achieve the goods internal to any individual practice (like chess-playing). Those qualities are akin to virtues but not virtues except in a derivative, analogous sense. If I were to emphasize their difference from virtues in the primary sense, I would simply call them individual skills; if I were to emphasize their commonalities, I would call them virtue-skills.  Skills are ‘acquired human characteristics’ that share certain features with virtues: they are habitual, learned, and can contribute to an agent’s character. But they are only derivative in that they contribute to goods of this or that particular practice rather than of the general project of living flourishing human lives. MacIntyre seems to concede this distinction when he concedes that some practices might be oriented toward wicked ends. So virtue-skills are not, by definition, traits that benefit their possessor. 

The second layer of virtue is a skill that emerges within social practices. Skills related to political activity is an example. These skills are not even conceivably individualistic; they are always performed by people with other people within a community. And yet this layer or dimension is not, I would argue, the primary sense of ‘virtue.’ The reason is that communities can be corrupt. An entire social group can engage in a social practice that is itself vicious, that is antithetical to human flourishing. The social practice of trading slaves might be an example. A community composed of members who each have the skill of performing that activity in such a way as to achieve the goods internal to slave-trading would seem to count as “virtuous” by MacIntyre’s loose standard, but this feels forced. The intension of the term ‘virtue’ is partly, by definition, good activities (meaning good for creatures like us). 

So it seems to me important that only MacIntyre’s third layer or dimension of virtue is properly so called. Virtues that contribute to the goods internal to the “practice” of human life as a whole. We must conceive of human life as a narrative unity, with beginning (birth and childhood) middle (maturity and adulthood) and end (decrepitude and death). Those qualities such as courage, moderation, kindness, generosity, affability and so on that contribute to success qua human flourishing are properly virtues. They help us to flourish, they are necessary conditions of a flourishing human person and community. Of course, this is the sense of the term ‘virtue’ that Aristotle gave millennia ago. 

So if only this third dimension of the MacIntyre’s concept of virtue deserves the unqualified epithet ‘virtue,’ and if that concept was already explicated in detail by Aristotle, then is MacIntyre’s painstaking construction of a three-layered account pointless? There is a point of importance to be extracted, I think. That important point can only be seen if one builds up to the concept of virtue from (potentially value-neutral) individual practices or skills to (potentially value-neutral) social practices.</Text>

            <Text>####MacIntyre 

MacIntyre's *After Virtue* tells a story. Our predecessors had an understanding of the virtues that allowed them to individually and collectively pursue the human good together. We moderns have fragmented virtue and now we are trying to put it back together again. But the problem is not just that we moderns lack virtue; we lack an understanding of virtue combined with a partial understanding of several incomplete fragments of virtue. 

The solution is, first, to get perspective on the problem behind the problem.  The “problem behind the problem” is the Enlightenment abandonment of telos for individual human persons and whole human communities or political units all directed towards one shared human good, the personal and political virtues being in this frame the means to that telos. The solution to that is the personal and political restoration of a shared conception of a good — better yet, a shared recognition of the real good — and a realignment with the broadly Aristotelian tradition in cultivating the virtues that are by definition means to that telos. 


MacIntyre is clear that the loss of telos in our worldview is the loss of truth. So why would an ethical framework appeal to Aristotelianism without telos? I can't see any good reason. One reason that is not a *good* reason is that we have been bullied to reject certain scientific truths by a dogmatic philosophical minority. Is it too bold to respond to such bullying by... just saying no? I revisit this question below.

How naturalistic is this virtue ethic? [I have argued that we cannot simply adopt the title for social reasons if we deny the majority view of what nature is.] How Aristotelian is neo-Aristotelianism? We ought not expect that every jot and tittle of Aristotle be preserved as sacred, but we ought to expect that some of Aristotle’s own core commitments overlap with a neo-Aristotelian’s core commitment. 

R. Scott Smith argues that MacIntyre’s virtue ethics assumes realism (Smith, Virtue Ethics and Moral Knowledge). Without the assumption, it loses coherence.

Many of those who rejected MacIntyre’s turn to Aristotle define “virtue” primarily along moral lines, as obedience to law or adherence to some kind of natural norm. For these critics, “virtuous” appears synonymous with “morally correct;” their resistance to MacIntyre’s appeal to virtue stems from their difficulties either with what they take to be the shortcomings of MacIntyre’s account of moral correctness or with the notion of moral correctness altogether. Thus one group of critics rejects MacIntyre’s Aristotelianism because they hold that any Aristotelian account of the virtues must first account for the truth about virtue in terms of Aristotle’s philosophy of nature, which MacIntyre had dismissed in AV as “metaphysical biology” (AV, pp. 162, 179). Aristotelian metaphysicians, particularly Thomists who define virtue in terms of the perfection of nature, rejected MacIntyre’s contention that an adequate Aristotelian account of virtue as excellence in practical reasoning and human action need not appeal to Aristotelian metaphysics. Another group of critics, including materialists, dismissed MacIntyre’s attempt to recover an Aristotelian account of the virtues because they took those virtues to presuppose an indefensible metaphysical doctrine of nature.

A few years after the publication of AV, MacIntyre became a Thomist and accepted that the teleology of human action flowed from a metaphysical foundation in the nature of the human person (WJWR, ch. 10; AV, 3rd ed., p. xi). Nonetheless, MacIntyre has the main points of his ethics and politics of human action have remained the same. MacIntyre continues to argue toward an Aristotelian account of practical reasoning through the investigation of practice. Even though he has accepted Thomistic metaphysics, he seldom argues from metaphysical premises, and when pressed to explain the metaphysical foundations of his ethics, he has demurred. MacIntyre continues to argue from the experience of practical reasoning to the demands of moral education. MacIntyre’s work in WJWR, DRA, The Tasks of Philosophy, Ethics and Politics, and God, Philosophy, University continue to exemplify the phenomenological approach to moral education that MacIntyre took in After Virtue.

From the subjective standpoint of the human enquirer, MacIntyre finds that theories, concepts, and facts all have histories, and they are all liable to change—for better or for worse. MacIntyre’s philosophy offers a decisive refutation of modern epistemology, even as it maintains philosophy is a quest for truth. MacIntyre’s philosophy is indebted to the philosophy of science, which recognizes the historicism of scientific enquiry even as it seeks a truthful understanding of the world. MacIntyre’s philosophy does not offer a priori certainty about any theory or principle; it examines the ways in which reflection upon experience supports, challenges, or falsifies theories that have appeared to be the best theories so far to the people who have accepted them so far. MacIntyre’s ideal enquirers remain Hamlets, not Emmas.

To fulfill this promise, MacIntyre opens the book by arguing that “the Enlightenment made us . . . blind to . . . a conception of rational enquiry as embodied in a tradition, a conception according to which the standards of rational justification themselves emerge from and are part of a history.” From the standpoint of human enquiry, no group can arrogate to itself the authority to guide everyone else toward the good. We can only struggle together in our quests for justice and truth and each community consequently frames and revises its own standards of justice and rationality. MacIntyre concludes that neither reason nor justice is universal: “since there are a diversity of traditions of enquiry, with histories, there are, so it will turn out, rationalities rather than rationality, just as it will also turn out that there are justices rather than justice” (p. 9).

MacIntyre holds that his historicist, particularist critique of modernity is consistent with Thomism because of the way that he understands the acquisition of first principles. In chapter 10 (pp. 164-182), MacIntyre compares Thomas Aquinas’s account of the acquisition of first principles with those of Descartes, Hobbes, Hume, Bentham, and Kant. MacIntyre explains that according to Thomas Aquinas, individuals reach first principles through “a work of dialectical construction” (p. 174). For Thomas Aquinas, by questioning and examining one’s experience, one may eventually arrive at first principles, which one may then apply to the understanding of one’s questions and experience. Descartes and his successors, by contrast, along with certain “notable Thomists of the last hundred years” (p. 175), have proposed that philosophy begins from knowledge of some “set of necessarily true first principles which any truly rational person is able to evaluate as true” (p. 175). Thus for the moderns, philosophy is a technical rather than moral endeavor, while for the Thomist, whether one might recognize first principles or be able to apply them depends in part on one’s moral development (pp. 186-182).

Modernity does not see tradition as the key that unlocks moral and political understanding, but as a superfluous accumulation of opinions that tend to prejudice moral and political reasoning. Although modernity rejects tradition as a method of moral and political enquiry, MacIntyre finds that it nevertheless bears all the characteristics of a moral and political tradition. MacIntyre identifies the peculiar standards of the liberal tradition in the latter part of chapter 17, and summarizes the story of the liberal tradition at the outset of chapter 18:

How, then, is one to settle challenges between two traditions? It depends on whether the adherents of either take the challenges of the other tradition seriously. It depends on whether the adherents of either tradition, on seeing a failure in their own tradition are willing to consider an answer offered by their rival (p. 355). There is nothing in MacIntyre’s account of the rationality of traditions that suggest that the superior traditions will vanquish inferior ones, or to provide any analogue to the modern, enlightenment, or Cartesian epistemological first principles that he rejected in his critique of the modern liberal individualist tradition.

WJWR is more than a restatement of the history from AV. AV had argued that an Aristotelian view of moral philosophy as a study of human action could make sense of the failure of modern moral philosophy while modern liberal individualism could not. Aristotelian and Thomist critics complained, however, that MacIntyre’s Aristotelianism, which sought its foundation in teleological activity rather than teleological metaphysics, remained open to the challenge that it was relativistic. WJWR advances the argument of AV in two ways. First, MacIntyre focuses the critique of modernity on the question of rational justification. Modern epistemology stands or falls on the possibility of Cartesian epistemological first principles. MacIntyre’s history exposes that notion of first principle as a fiction, and at the same time demonstrates that rational enquiry advances (or declines) only through tradition. Second, MacIntyre trades the social teleology of AV for a Thomist, metaphysical teleology. MacIntyre justifies this trade in terms acceptable within the Thomist tradition, and acknowledges that those who find Thomism irrational will find little reason to accept it (WJWR P. 403).

Genealogists, on the other hand, focus on the past in order to undermine the claims of the present. The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, Genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.

DRA does not make metaphysical assertions about the human soul, or human dignity, or human rights, or natural law; it treats the human agent as an animal. “Human identity is primarily . . . bodily and therefore animal identity and it is by reference to that identity that the continuities of our relationships to others are partly defined” ( DRA, p. 8). Like other intelligent animals, human beings enter life vulnerable, weak, untrained, and unknowing, and face the likelihood of infirmity in sickness and in old age. Like other social animals, humans flourish in groups. We learn to regulate our passions, and to act effectively alone and in concert with others through an education provided within a community. MacIntyre’s position allows him to look to the animal world to find analogies to the role of social relationships in the moral formation of human beings (DRA, pp. 21-28).

As in his earlier writings, including his MA thesis, DRA presents moral knowledge as a “knowing how,” rather than as a “knowing that.” Knowledge of moral rules is not sufficient for a moral life; prudence is required to enable the agent to apply the rules well. “Knowing how to act virtuously always involves more than rule-following” (DRA, p. 93). The prudent person can judge what must be done in the absence of a rule and can also judge when general norms cannot be applied to particular cases.

“Social Structures and Their Threats to Moral Agency” expands and develops on the theme of compartmentalization that MacIntyre touched upon in AV (AV, p. 204). The essay examines social structures that encourage compartmentalization of one’s life and thus threaten the human agent’s capacity to recognize, judge, and do what is good and best for her- or himself, as a member of a larger community. MacIntyre considers “the case of J” (J, for jemand, the German word for “someone”), a train controller who learned, as a standard for his social role, to take no interest in what his trains carried, even during war time when they carried “munitions and . . . Jews on their way to extermination camps” (E&amp;P, p. 187). J had learned to do his work for the railroad according to one set of standards and to live other parts of his life according to other standards, so that this compliant participant in “the final solution” could contend, “You cannot charge me with moral failure” (E&amp;P, p. 187).

MacIntyre is sometimes categorized as a “virtue ethicist,” and AV is counted among the principle texts in virtue ethics, but this label may be misleading for MacIntyre. Virtue ethics developed as an alternative to modern moral theories. The purpose of the modern moral philosophy of authors like Kant and Mill was to determine, rationally and universally, what kinds of behavior ought to be performed—not in terms of the agent’s desires or goals, but in terms of universal, rational duties. Those theories purported to let agents know what they ought to do by providing knowledge of duties and obligations, thus they could be described as theories of moral epistemology. Contemporary virtue ethics proposes an alternative to modern moral theory, but takes for granted that the purpose of ethics is to provide a moral epistemology. Contemporary virtue ethics purports to let agents know what qualities human beings ought to have, and the reasons that we ought to have them, not in terms of our fitness for human agency, but in the same universal, disinterested, non-teleological terms that it inherits from Kant and Mill. MacIntyre’s ethical project examines the virtues, but it is not a branch of moral epistemology.

The purpose of the constructive argument of the second half of AV is to renew teleological practical reasoning, but MacIntyre attempted to renew Aristotelian teleology while rejecting Aristotelian metaphysics. The teleology of AV, like the teleology of MacIntyre’s broader project since “Notes from the Moral Wilderness,” was to be a social teleology, discovered through reflection on experience. The social teleology appeared to have two advantages. First, it forestalled a host of objections that MacIntyre was involved in an arbitrary, atavistic project to return, whole cloth, to the world view of Aristotle including his views on the subjugation of women and “natural slaves.” Second, in keeping with the insight of Marx’s third thesis on Feuerbach, it maintained the common condition of theorists and people as peers in the pursuit of the good life. MacIntyre grew to reconsider the adequacy of social teleology in the years following AV. In the Prologue to the 3rd edition (2007), MacIntyre reported that he had accepted from Thomas Aquinas that it was necessary to provide a metaphysical grounding for the social teleology: It is only because human beings have an end toward which they are directed by reason of their specific nature, that practices, traditions, and the like are able to function as they do. So I discovered that I had, without realizing it, presupposed the truth of something very close to the account of the concept of good that Aquinas gives in question 5 of the first part of the Summa Theologiae (p. xi). In MacIntyre’s subsequent Thomist works, principally WJWR (chapters 10 &amp; 11), 3RV (chapters 5 &amp; 6), his Aquinas Lecture, First Principles, Final Ends, and Contemporary Philosophical Issues, and “On Being a Theistic Philosopher in a Secularized Culture,” MacIntyre explicitly defends a metaphysical foundation for teleology.

AV does not define virtue in metaphysical terms as the perfection of nature (AV, pp. 148, 196). AV defines virtue in terms of the practical requirements for excellence in human agency, in an agent’s participation in practices (AV, ch. 14), in an agent’s whole life, and in an agent’s involvement in the life of her or his community ( AV, chapter 15). This peculiar form of Aristotelianism, which MacIntyre described in the “Postscript to the 2nd ed.” of AV as “an historicist defense of Aristotle” (AV, p. 277), remains controversial among Aristotelian and Thomistic metaphysicians.

Where modern moral philosophy seeks rational moral criteria to judge individual human acts without considering the subjective ends of the agent, MacIntyre seeks to understand what it takes for the human person to become the kind of agent who has the practical wisdom to recognize what is good and best to do and the moral freedom to act on her or his best judgment. In this way, MacIntyre’s Aristotelian account of human action opposes the late medieval and modern reduction of ethics to the moral assessment of behavior.

            <Title>Huneman, Naturalizing Purpose (2006) </Title>
            <Text>Naturalizing Purpose Philippe Huneman (2006)

Huneman, Philippe. "Naturalising purpose: From comparative anatomy to the ‘adventure of reason’." Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 37, no. 4 (2006): 649-674.


Keith’s Abstract: 

Huneman’s article discusses Kant’s concept of natural purpose as analyzed in the third Critique. Organisms, Kant argued, display special features that demand a “special regulative teleological principle” (Huneman 2006, 1). Organisms display adaptation, functionality, and conservation of forms. 

Kant explained all three features in terms of natural purpose. Those who followed Kant split these three features into two sub-groups. Cuvier’s comparative anatomy emphasized adaptation and used adaptive features to classify organisms. Goethe and Geoffrey studied the form and function of organisms in order to posit an explanation of how forms transform. 

Kant thought “general transformations in nature” impossible. Goethe thought it possible only by changing the definition of explanation’ from “investigation of mechanical processes of generation” to “the unveiling of some ideal transformations of types instantiated by those organisms.”

E. S. Russell’s Form and Function “conceived the history of biology as torn between two poles: the concept of form… and the concept of function” (Huneman 2006, 1-2%). Anatomy studies form and physiology studies function. Cuvier followed the anatomical study of form; Geoffrey followed the physiological study of function. 

A response: Aristotle’s empirical discussion of four natural causes solves many otherwise intractable puzzles. If form and telos (something pertain to function) are both necessary causes in most natural objects and all organisms, then we simply have to study form and function, anatomy and physiology. 

Huneman summarizes Kant’s progress in this way: “Since his precritical texts, Kant had emphasized the need for a non-mechanistic understanding of the phenomena manifest by organized beings” (3%). Kant was not satisfied by the existing mechanistic theories of Albrecht Haller and Herman Boerhaave. The mechanistic pictures may be methodologically sound assumptions, but they always ignore the “uniqueness of the organic realm” (3).  

Kant’s third Critique gives an account of purposiveness. Purpose was, in Kant’s earlier biological and philosophical works, an irreducible feature of biological organisms that could not be accounted for in purely mechanistic terms (Huneman 3). This account Huneman summarizes by discussing Kant’s account of races. 

Racial generation was a mechanistic process emerging from epigenetic dispositions of an organism. “Germs” were hypothesized to explain sameness and difference in organisms. A germ was a “preformationist’ have that is already stamped upon a zygote. This concept was defended by Nicolas Malebranche and Gottfried Leibniz, and (in weaker form) by Charles Bonnet and Haller. Kant’s account stated that racial criteria are explicable in reference to internal and necessary properties (germs), but that characteristics like hair color are explicable with reference to external and contingent properties like climate and geography which manifest “hidden dispositions”  (4). Kant’s conception of race then appealed to germs to explain common racial characteristics across generations and across geographies and even within blended or biracial persons while appealing to the influence of climate to explain the emergence of various inactivated potentialities. 

In light of these reflections, what then is natural purpose? “A natural purpose is a peculiar kind of relationship between a whole and its parts, in which we judge (in a reflective manner) the whole to condition the form and relations of the parts” (4). Artificial entities (like watches) are produced; natural entities (like eyes) produce themselves. And organisms produce their parts, constraining the “forms and relationships of the parts” (4). Kant thought that the very notion of an organism presupposes that we judge the whole to be a cause of its parts. Kant did not think that this transcendental (that is, inevitable) presupposition reflects the metaphysical facts, just that it reflects a necessary feature of our cognition. We can “conceive of this causation but we cannot really know it” (5). To put the point polemically, Kant is a radically anti-scientific skeptic. He has given up on biological explanations of organisms in favor of psychological explanations of our cognitions. 

I take a different tack. Since I and my intended audience consists of scientific realists, I would posit the following hypothesis: If a judgment that P is transcendental (that is, if it is impossible not to judge that P), then P is true (that is, P is made true by the facts). It is impossible not to judge that organisms cause the formation and relation of their parts. Therefore, organisms cause the formation and relation of their parts. 

Regardless, Kant’s account of the development of embryos affirmed that the “disposition and germs proper to a species are basically already present at the beginning of embryogenesis, and their relationship with the environment provides the guidelines for the embryogenic process” (6%). Species do not spontaneously emerge, nor are the dispositions and germs “mechanically caused.” Epigeneticist “implied the denial of two epistemological boundaries: the boundary between organized and unorganized beings; and the boundary between species. Without a boundary between species, there would be “systematic order of nature.”

Cuvier
Georges Cuvier followed Kant. An organism, for Cuvier, is an organized whole that causes its parts to be formed and related just so. Comparative anatomy studies form and function of animal “machines” and the relations between form, function, and organs. ALl possible “combinations of organs… are submitted to the ‘principle of the conditions of existence’, which Cuvier added is ‘vulgarly called principle of the final causes’. According to this principle, ‘all the organs concur to a common purpose; hence, the alterations of one of them produce an influence over all the others’” (11). Carnivores need teeth to catch prey, alert eyes to see well, and so on. Cuvier’s insistance of final causality was regulative and epistemological rather than substantive and metaphysical. One must presuppose not that “animals are built to reach a goal, but rather … [that] the parts are linked and the functions to which they contribute co-ordinate themselves” (11). The form of the animal, the whole, causes its parts to be generated and related just so not through mechanistic (efficient) causation but formal causation. For Cuvier, organic matter “is organized from the beginning” and so he rejected spontaneous generation. Species are fixed, and adaptation to environmental milieu accounts for changes within species but not for species transformations. 

Kant
Kant recognized the stunning archetypes discernible through comparative biological study. The “archeology of nature…reinforces our suspicion” that the diversity of species are related as to a common “original mother” (14). 

But mechanistic causes are still not sufficient to explain how the earth produced purposive forms in the first place. 

Also, experience and empirical knowledge know only of generation of a species from that same species. The “more radical archeology, one advocating the transformation of another species, is not empirically plausible. Transformations is transcendentally possible but deprived of any empirical evidence” (16). 

The concept of “natural purposes” arises with organized matter. We might say: final causes arise with formal causes. 

Goethe
Goethe, according to Hunemann, made it his project to undertake the “adventure of reason” that Kant closed off. </Text>

            <Text>####Telos and Final Cause
1. Is our final cause survival and reproduction?
* It seems that it is for survival and reproduction are the final cause of all living things, all organisms on the tree of life.
* Furthermore the drive for survival, Metabolsis, and reproduction are the only processes that all living things have in common. They are the proper act, the distinctive work, the unique function of living things.
* The drive for life in humans is stronger then other competing drives, including whatever conscience or moral norms dictate, since most people will do what is dishonorable or wrong to preserve their own lives, or the lives of their genetic kin. 
 * The drive for reproduction, the sex drive, is stronger than even our drive for eating or drinking or other forms of pleasure. Psychologists tell us that males think about sex every eight minutes, or so. Also people will have sex at almost any opportunity. The Olympic Village being an example. Also, people reproduce far beyond the rate that other considerations recommend. The species is rapidly over populating the planet at the expense of other ecosystems, other species, other lifeforms like the rain forest, and even the planets as a whole.
* On the contrary, Socrates tells the Athenians at his trial to cultivate virtue which is the health of the soul more than the adornment and pleasure of the body. And many other moral exemplars, Saints, and sages tell us that the final cause of humanity as a species are something more then our biological dictates.
* I answer that our end as the perfection of our nature. In so far as our nature includes but is not limited to our biology, our end includes but is not limited to our biology. Furthermore, occasionally the pursuit of our final cause demands that we ignore or reject or deny the dictates of our biology. As for instance, a parent who is down to her last loaf of bread will suffer hunger herself in order to feed her children. Or a celibate monk who will forgo the pleasures of sex, the biological interest in reproduction, and the joy of child rearing for the sake of the perfection of intellect and heart. 

* Plus, Saints just do not talk like that. They talk about serving God, or becoming enlightened, or beholding the truth, or spreading happiness to all. Notice that spreading happiness to all May or may not correspond to maximizing my own personal happiness.
* Talk about such final causes has seem more likely to be included in the definition of perfecting human nature according to its form is in ennobling. 
* By contrast talk about final causes such as survival and reproduction is morally enervating. People who think and talk like this display also pathological psychologies obsessed with what is merely animal and ignoring or denying or rejecting what is more than animal. 

The clearest and best definition of virtue I have ever heard is still the simplest. The first definition I heard it's still the clearest invest.

The virtue of X is a property of X that makes it F well, where F is its proper function, it's proper work, or achieving its final cause, attaining to its telos, actualizing the potential inherent to its form. A virtue of a knife is that property of a knife that makes it cut well. Knives are supposed to cut, that is what they are for, cutting and occasionally stabbing are its final causes, it's proper function. And so the virtues of knives is at least: being sharp, being durable enough and hard enough to cut through matter softer than itself, and depending on the knife a serrated edge or a sharp point. There are a variety of species of knife, who's functions display a variety of species of cutting and or stabbing. The purpose or final cause of a knife is also relative to the user of the knife. Since we are speaking about implements for humans, a virtue of the knife may include such necessary properties as having one and that is emphatically not sharp so that the user can hold that end without being cut.

Now if all this qualification is necessary for something so simple an artifact as a knife, it will take much more work to sketch even a plausible prima Facie Account of the final cause of simple natural objects, let alone complex organisms.  Doing that work is our task.

What does Aristotle say is the telos of, say, an oak tree? The answer must be discovered at least in part empirically. Some induction or abstraction helps us to identify the form behind the phenomena we observe. Oaktree's tend to become fully grown folks. At some point the maturation process slows and stops. What do fully grown oaks do? What is their proper work? They provide oxygen into the atmosphere. They provide housing for birds, bugs, and shade and housing for primates and humans. They preserve the soil. They grow and reproduce. What properties might qualify as the virtues of an oak?  Certainly needs sunshine water atmosphere and soil of a certain kind to thrive Qua Oaktree.  But these are not its virtues, these are necessary conditions for the rising of its virtues. Contributing factors we might call them. Sources of life. It's virtues would be strength of limb, deep roots, strong cellulose walls, a sufficiently wide trunk, etc.

What is the final cause of a human? What is our proper work? It is not a tautology to say that what we are supposed to do is to be men and women. For we can fail at that. Once we have human nature, we cannot fail to be human in some descriptive sense. But even though we have human nature, we can fail to be happy, to achieve humanity in a prescriptive cents.

We are supposed to thrive, flesh, be happy. We are supposed to be Saints. That means wise thinkers and heroically virtuous doers.

Comment: The neo-Aristotelian allows herself to demolish as much from Aristotle’s architectonic as she wants, and attempt in the vacuum to either rebuild a new structure that fits the same space or else patch the hole and move on.

“A child is born. It is immediately immersed in sensation and greeted with discomfort. It is relieved by fondling and feeding. It experiences touch and taste, hearing and sight, scent and movement. The earliest sensations are doubtless blurry. But soon, discrimination begins. This is a differential responsiveness to experiences. The child reaches out for milk, smiles at Mama, cries from loud noises.
It is not clear when the first beliefs are formed. Their formation is facilitated by discrimination, but belief-formation is not entailed by discrimination. Belief requires understanding. Whereof one cannot understand, thereof one cannot believe. Understanding, in turn, requires concepts. Concepts arise in interlocking formations. Beliefs do not arise in isolation either, one doxastic atom at a time. Like concepts, they are formed, and work, in families.
We are blessed not only with a receptiveness to learning from experience but also with a capacity to learn from what we already know. One route to learning is generalization: if a small yelping dog jumps at a child, the child expects much the same of a big one. Another, overlapping, route to learning is inference. Inference, too, appears early in life. We infer certain consequences of some of the things we believe. A child told that the family cannot have animals needs no logical prowess to infer that the puppy offered by neighbors will not be accepted. We also make inferences to the best explanation. The same child may infer from canine squeals at the door that the puppy is outside.” (Robert Audi, Rationality and the Good, p. 3). 


“How Far Can Finlay Claim Naturalism?
Taking a step back from the details discussed so far, let's say that we accept Finlay's reduction of normative terms to probabilistic terms. Does that mean that he has shown that normative properties just are a species of natural properties, thereby analytically reducing the normative to the natural? Only if we assume that probabilistic terms represent natural properties, and I think there is reason to worry about this assumption.
Finlay doesn't define "natural", but he does helpfully describe his methodology as follows:
I shall employ an analytic method, seeking a metaphysical analysis of normative facts, properties, and relations by means of a conceptual analysis of the meanings of the normative words by which we refer to them. The result will be a form of analytic reductionism (or "analytic naturalism"), an explanatory reduction of normative properties (etc.) into complexes of non-normative properties by reductively defining normative words and concepts in entirely non-normative terms. (p. 4)
This suggests that all it takes for a property to count as "natural" is for it to be non-normative. That, however, is clearly wrong (and can't really be what Finlay means, which he is quite clear about in his nice survey article "Four Faces of Moral Realism"). If we reduced normative properties into non-normative super-naturalproperties (e.g., through some sort of divine command theory), that clearly wouldn't count as a form of "analytic naturalism" in the sense that is at issue in metaethics. Hence, the more precise (though still frustratingly vague) characterization of a natural property typically used in metaethics is of a property that is countenanced by the best (scientific) theory of reality (e.g., that to which physics, chemistry, and biology are a good guide). But -- here's the worry -- are probabilities countenanced by the best scientific theory of reality?
It's tempting to think that contemporary scientific theory is rife with appeals to statistics and chance, so probabilistic terms must have one of the best claims to count as representing natural properties. As Finlay recognizes, however, the sense of 'more probable' that he needs in his analysis of normative terms is one that encompasses not only so-called objective chances but also subjective likelihoods.” (Matthew Chrisman, Review of Stephen Finlay’s Confusion of Tongues, https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/53456-confusion-of-tongues-a-theory-of-normative-language/)

“2.3 High moral theory
Normative ethical theories vary considerably in terms of their aspirations towards generalization, universality, abstractness, systematic organization, simplicity, and comprehensiveness (Nussbaum 2000, Flynn 2007). Paradigmatic examples of what we'll call “high moral theory” attempt to embody most or all of these defining characteristics. Thus classical utilitarianism, Kantian deontology, and Rawlsian justice as fairness, for example, all strive for the articulation of a theoretical system based upon a small number of abstract fundamental principles (e.g., Mill's principle of utility, Kant's categorical imperative, and Rawls's famous two principles of justice) that they regard as the “keys” to understanding the moral or political life. These principles in their pristine incarnations are capable of being articulated in a perfectly general and universal fashion without any reference to or dependency upon any particular social practices or cultural norms. They apply, so their authors tell us, to all rational agents as such.[14] Beginning from these highly abstract and universally binding moral norms, standard examples of high moral theory ramify into complex systems encompassing basic and derivative moral principles (e.g., respect the autonomy of rational agents), rules based upon such principles (e.g., do not enlist patients in biomedical research without first gaining their informed consent), and, finally, judgments animated by such principles and rules bearing on particular cases (e.g., the Tuskegee syphilis study was unethical).
Although most philosophers might naturally think of such highly abstract and ambitious constructions as paradigmatic examples of moral theory, and most likely have precisely such theories in mind when asked about the relationships between bioethics and ethical theory, they do not exhaust the space of normative theorizing either in bioethics or within the moral life more generally.” (John Arras, “Theory and Bioethics”, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).

A response: My account is an attempt to strike a balance between high and common. Such attempts are fraught with danger. The high aims for truth, systematicity, simplicity, elegance; the common aims for usefulness, practicality, complexity to match the rough and tumble of situational ethics, and ruggedness. These two sets of aims are either incompatible or only compatible barely. 

Moral Disagreement Today and the Claims of Emotivism
“Keynes: ‘In practice, victory was with those who could speak with the greatest appearance of clear, undoubting conviction and could best use the accents of infallibility,’ and Keynes goes on to describe the effectiveness of Moore’s gasps of incredulity and head-shaking, of Strachey’s grim silences and of Lowes Dickinson’s shrugs.” (MacIntyre, After Virtue 17)
 
Plato, Sophist
“There appears to be a sort of war of Giants and Gods going on amongst them; they are fighting with one another about the nature of essence.”
“How is that?” 
“Some of them are dragging down all things from heaven and from the unseen to earth, and they literally grasp in their hands rocks and oaks; of these they lay hold, and obstinately maintain, that the things only which can be touched or handled have being or essence, because they define being and body as one, and if any one else says that what is not a body exists they altogether despise him, and will hear of nothing but body.” 
“I have often met with such men, and terrible fellows they are.”


Biology and Virtue?
“In After Virtue he had rejected Aristotle's biological teleology – which is the idea that human beings have a telos because of the particular kind of creature that we are. Aristotle says that only human beings have the ability to speak and reason and therefore our telos is to develop that reason. In Dependent Rational Animals MacIntyre now accepts the idea of a biological teleology, but much of his argument for this is based on the idea that it is not human beings alone that have the ability to speak and reason; dolphins and gorillas can also do these things, and we can learn something about humans from how these other animals pursue their individual and collective goods. What we learn is that for human beings the key to flourishing is to be an independent practical reasoner” (Dependent Rational Animals 77).” (Clayton, “Political Philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre”, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/p-macint/#H6)

Moral Reasoning Practical Reasoning
“For Aristotle, moral philosophy is a study of practical reasoning, and the excellences or virtues that Aristotle recommends in the Nicomachean Ethics are the intellectual and moral excellences that make a moral agent effective as an independent practical reasoner.” (Christopher Stephen Lutz, “Alasdair MacIntyre” Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy). 

Philosophical ethics
“The history of moral theory is a history of attempts to identify, articulate, and defend general moral principles that serve to explain when and why various types of action, institutions, or characters count as right or wrong, just or unjust, virtuous or vicious. The assumption has consistently been that there is a general and principled account of morality to be given” (Sayre-McCord 2014).

Moral realism is not scientific
“One major concern that many people have had about the answer to this question is that they have noticed that morality is not a very scientific topic” (Schroeder 2010, 15). 


“A tradition is an argument extended through time in which certain fundamental agreements are defined and redefined" in terms of both internal and external debates” (MacIntyre 1988, 9). 

Not anthropocentric, but biocentric (if not yet cosmological)
“A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.” Aldo Leopold, “Land Ethic” in A Sand Country Almanic, Oxford, 1949. p. 262. 


Natural Law and Ought
“Sixth, Anscombe’s hypothesis does not explain what it is supposed to explain, which is the separation of the ‘ought’ from the ‘is’. For even if one needs a law to give sense to this ‘ought’, why should not nature, instead of God, be the law- giver? We may have lost the notion of divine law but we have also lost the notion of natural law; and the latter is the crucial one, for if it were the support of the ‘ought’ and the relevant sense of nature was lost, it would be very easy to explain why the ‘ought’ should be divorced from the ‘is’. The same would not be so if a law-giving God was lost but a law-giving nature retained, for then, while the ‘ought’ would be separated from religion, it would not be separated from the ‘is’.” (Simpson, Peter, and Sine Quibus Non. "Goodness and nature." Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff (1987)., p 85)




“MacIntyre convincingly proves that rationality and ethics are inseparable; that it is impossible for the unjust person to think rationally, or for the irrational person to be just. Consequently, the liberal presumption of a shared, ahistorical, “objective” rationality which can be brought to bear to resolve differences in values and conceptions of justice, is a delusion.”

            <Text>7. **Can we do without telos? objection**

It seems that morality (not to mention politics and society) can get along well without teleological realism. 

1. It seems that the moral law *by itself* tells us what actions are wrong or not wrong. @korsgaard1996authority argues that the autonomous moral law delivers judgments -- and generates categorical obligations -- without regard to teleology. These duties or laws are generated by our *practical identity*. That is, there are some actions that violate my practical identities. Trivially, if I call myself a baker I must bake things. If I refuse to bake I disintegrate that practical identity. Though she does not say it like this, I would state that identities are *functional concepts.* To be a farmer is in some sense to *do what farmers do*. To be a sea captain, or a teacher, or a father, is to *perform the functions* prescribed by or definitionally built into those concepts. Even if the exact limits and boundaries of a functional concept are sometimes fuzzy or flexible, they are still intelligible. Now, my first and fundamental practical identity is that of human being.[@korsgaard1996authority] I simply must value my own humanity if I am to value anything at all. And I do value things; therefore, I do value my own humanity. Anyone who values anything values their own humanity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 

2. It seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of telos. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). Peter Singer is one consequentialist argues that the actions that result in the greatest pleasure or least pain for *all* animals. This posits happiness or pleasure or freedom from pain as a kind of telos for all living things. 

On the other hand, however, these modern moralities are either covertly teleological or they are incoherent. Charles Taylor argues this point persuasively.[@taylor] 

I answer that modern morality (and indeed modern biology!) assume teleology. 

To reject the notion that actions are end-directed is incoherent action theory. 

The concept of a ‘function’ is a normative, teleological concept. The heart’s function is to pump blood. This statement asserts a relation between the heart’s formal properties and its “final” or teleological properties. The heart


1. Reply to 1. Korsgaard's point here is not far off from MacIntyre's (nor I assume far from Sandel's or any other communitarian's). Her thesis is that a moral identity qua practical identity is fundamental and supports other practical identities (like son, brother, citizen, teacher). Insofar as human nature is a real thing, MacIntyre can agree that humanity is a functional concept. If I am to be human, there are some deeds I must do. MacIntyre (and, I presume, other communitarians) would simply query whether I can discover my identity qua human before discovering it qua American or member of the Buhler family or "westerner". What is deepest metaphysically is last epistemologically. MacIntyre might argue that Korsgaard cannot discover her identity qua human without her western education, without reading Kant, without the benefit of being a part of the Enlightenment tradition. 

2. Reply to 2. Consequences may be "external" or "internal." That is, consequences of an action may be non-natural or natural. The oxygenation of the blood is a natural consequence of breathing. Our biological make-up determines that the act of breathing and the oxygenation of the blood an organic whole. A natural consequence of holding your breath is a build up of carbon dioxide. Winning a world record for holding your breath underwater is a non-natural consequence of holding your breath. Consequentialists either do not distinguish between the two or are explicit that there are no ends or consequences related internally or naturally with some means. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;But before proceeding to this discussion I propose, first, to deal with the third kind of ethical question—the question: What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalisation. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. Good effects Moore argues are aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships. Strangely enough, the same Moore defines the necessary relation between parts and a whole as an "organic whole" or "organic unity." But he sees no organic unity between (some) means and their ends. Some means are partially constituitive of their ends. We might say that the *means* and the *end* form in that instance an organic whole. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constituitive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species gorilla gorilla as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics.

            <Title>### How do we live well? Obey Platitudes. Two kinds of philosophy: Debunk or Defend.</Title>
            <Text>### Is there truth in goodness? 

Before discuss MacIntyre’s approach to some of these questions, I would like to step back and ask a general methodological concern. It begins with this question: Are there ‘right answers’ in ethics? 

On the one hand, we can dodge the question, or answer it indirectly, by asking a question in return: Are there ‘right answers’ in philosophy? Isn’t the relation of philosophy in general to ethics in particular the relation of genus to species?This is the relation Russ Shafer-Landau argues for.[@shafer2012ethics] So the fate of ethical claims or ethical theories hangs on the fate of philosophical claims and theories as a whole. If we are philosophical optimists at all — if we are not total skeptics or nihilists — then we can be ethical optimists. 

I think this response a good one, as far as it goes. But I would also like to address it more directly. 

Some worry that ethics has no ‘right answers’ because it is all just intuition-pumping. Some people view ethics as too easy because it is only a discussion of one’s opinion. 

We must admit that normative ethical conclusions — whatever conclusions satisfy us at the end of a long philosophical discussion about what is good and right — are different from conclusions in paleontology, medicine, or calculus. What does the difference amount to? Why is ethics *as a discipline* so different from, say, natural sciences? 

There are two sorts of answers to the question about ethics as a discipline. The first is Hume’s answer, that ethics is “easy” (while metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophical anthropology are presumably difficult). The second is Aristotle’s, that ethics is *a different sort of science* because it has a *different subject matter* to which it must correspond. He says, “For a well schooled man is wanting searches for that degree of precision in each kind of study which the nature of the subject at hand admits: is obviously just as foolish to accept arguments of probability from a mathematician has to demand strict demonstrations from an orator.” [@aristotle Book I.3]

Thesis Draft 1: Naturalism is not false. But all its claim either necessarily true (a tautology), or trivial, or false. 
So for instance, the claim that all is physical is false because minds, mental contents, propositions, sets, moral values, epistemic norms, logical laws, mathematical properties and relations are real but not physical. 
The claim that all that is real emerges from or strongly supervenes on the physical is false because minds have top-down causation and chains of reasoning constituted by ground-consequent relations (like this one) cannot be reduced to chains of cause-effect relations while retaining their normative force. 
Naturalists must define science. But we cannot. The demarcation problem makes this impossible for them to do with satisfaction. I define a science as a body of knowledge, whether empirical or abstract, whether explanatory or predictive, whether inductive or deductive. In other words, I define science is knowledge and true opinion as opposed to false opinion (for there is no such thing as false knowledge). By my definition,  logic, mathematics, metaphysics, and theology are sciences and I defy anyone to prove that they are not. The claim that science is our “best way of knowing about the world” is a true, since “knowing is our best way of knowing what can be known” is necessarily true. 
The claim that science is the only way of knowing about what is real is similarly tautologous. What else would we trust but scientia? 
The claim that some of the biologists, geologists, archeologists, astronomers, medical doctors, and cosmologists (let us call them by their old name: natural philosophers) have achieved great advances in knowledge is true but trivial. What theist would disagree? But most of these natural philosophers, like Galileo, Copernicus, and yes even Einstein, were also theists. 
The claim that god doesn’t exist must be assessed in its own argument. But it can’t be made inductively by pointing out all the places and times gods are not apparent and concluding via the absence of evidence that gods are in no place and no time. 

The word naturalism does not denote a doctrine; it connotes. The real error of naturalists is that they don’t have anything to denote; they only have connotations, innuendos, provocative suggestions. They wealthy with knowing nods and dismissive asides; but we are so poor we don’t yet have a dogma. 


The examples of philosophers trying (or studiously avoiding trying) to define ‘nature’ or ‘natural’ are embarrassing: 
“Since it is notoriously difficult to define what a natural property is, I will not attempt to give a precise definition.1 Instead, I will act on the supposition that such an account can be given.”Attila Tanyi, “Naturalism and Triviality” Philosophical Writings, No. 32. Summer 2006.   </Text>

Thesis: “Empirical ethics” is false, or less plausible than my own theory advanced above. </Text>
            <Notes>Most philosophers believe that at least some of our ethical beliefs are really true and that some things are really good. But if the good is real, is it natural or nonnatural? Richard Boyd argues that our term ‘goodness’ refers to a set of natural “immanent” mutually reinforcing properties that favor human well-being. Robert Adams argues that the good is identical to a supernatural, transcendent God. Good things are such just insofar as they resemble God. Which metaethical position makes the best sense of our (sometimes correct, sometimes incorrect) application of ethical terms in everyday discourse and the historic discipline of systematic ethics? 

	These questions embroil us in metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, and semantic considerations. Of course, a full treatment of them here is not possible. As Boyd points out, metaphysical commitments to or against the existence of a god will sway one’s ethical commitments. Rather, in this paper, I examine a few facets of the larger dialectic, focusing on written conversation between Boyd and Adams spanning one book and three articles. I offer my own contribution to their conversation. My conclusion is that — even absent independent arguments from philosophy of religion— our most stable and cogent ethical thinking, and our most incorrigible ethical principles, sit better in a framework where the good is understood to be transcendent, and unitary. Adams has the upper hand, I think, for three reasons: (1) Adams’ account most accurately explains the intuitive truth that we ought to be open to revising many ethical beliefs but that there are some that we (already) know certainly enough that we ought not be open to revising them. (2) Boyd’s homeostatic property cluster idea, though impressive and thorough, is not yet ambitious enough to even aspire to explain the numerous (and apparently irreducible) various kinds of goodness (and beauty, and excellence, etc.) but restricts itself to human welfare, which is only part of an adequate metathics. And (3) epistemic norms are more closely related to ethical norms than Boyd would like to admit.</Notes>

##Abstract Draft 1

Virtue ethics has gained a resurgence of attention in philosophical as well as psychological and popular conversations about value, human life, happiness, and doing well. Philosophical naturalisms — from the very strict to the more liberal — have also been on the rise. 

The momentum of philosophical naturalism may continue until all of nature, life, the self, the cosmos has been subsumed under objective, third-personal categories and explained in objective, descriptive terms or else philosophical naturalism’s momentum may be checked by its inability to account for one or more features of (really real) reality. The putative entities that so far have resisted naturalization often include mind, consciousness, reason, practical reason, and value. As such, the naturalist ought to be interested and hopeful in finding or creating an account of value as virtue and of virtue as natural in some salient sense, or at least showing that one is in principle possible. A non-naturalist ought to be interested and hopeful in showing that any such account is in principle impossible, or at least that all such actual accounts are false and inadequate. 

This dissertation defends the thesis that all accounts thus far proposed for naturalizing virtue are inadequate, and that such an account is likely to be impossible, while giving due consideration to what the author judges to be the best naturalistic accounts of value and virtue, including reductive, eliminative, non-reductive rationalist, and non-reductive virtue ethical accounts. 


##Abstract Draft 2


Virtue theory, though resuming its popularity in analytic philosophy, has never quite disappeared from folk morality nor broader academic discourse. 

The criterion for an adequate metaethics is a satisfying explanation of those phenomena that puzzle us in life as lived, namely certain facts about human evaluative discourse, facts about our reasons for acting or not acting. 

Virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is such an explanation, in that it gives accounts for each puzzling explanandum and for all of them as a set.  

Other theories are not so satisfying. For instance, naturalistic neo-Aristotelian virtue theory either sacrifices virtue at the altar of (an ambiguous and ultimately vacuous version) of naturalism or sacrifices (the desired version of) naturalism at the altar of a robust virtue theory. 

Naturalistic ethical theories of a consequentialist sort that may be called  “welfarist” ignore all goods but human goods, and all human goods but human welfare and those actions that are liable to lead to human welfare. These theories, however sophisticated, have flaws — and moreover are woefully unambitious. 

Naturalistic ethical theories of a more scientific flavor also set out to explain explananda but ultimately resort to ignoring or denying the appearances — in other words, they refuse to explain at all. Ignoring phenomena that call for explanation does not do; especially if the explainer continues to help himself to virtue theoretical terms and concepts in daily life while denying their truth and adequacy in theory. 

Ultimately, metaethical and ethical theory (discourse about what is good per se and what is good for us) needs enrichment from virtue metaethical theory (specific discourse about virtues, happiness, practical reason) to be fully satisfying. And the ultimate question is not whether such neo-Aristotelian virtue theory is “naturalistic” or not; the contentious question is whether it is theistic or not. The question is not whether one can be good without God but whether one who is good can explain goodness without including a god in the account. Finally, the ultimate question is not whether we can get by without a god in our account — we can’t — but whether the god is us or someone else. Such questions are, of course, beyond the scope of an inquiry into metaethics. But likewise our theological stance can and should take clues from what seems most the most reasonable metaethical theory. 

KEYWORDS: virtue ethics, naturalism,  non-naturalism, naturalizing virtue, neo-Aristotelianism, flourishing, consequentialism

##*Abstract Draft 3*

Normative realism is rarely contested because it is so obviously true; moral realism is very often contested but is probably true as well. Virtue theory is making a comeback but is still hotly contested and the truth value of its various (often diverse) theses is far from settled. Naturalism is the new orthodoxy. So a primary research goal is to construct and give naturalistic accounts of normative realism, moral realism, and virtue theory. 

Virtue theoretical terms and concepts (not to mention the ethical history) can enrich our most plausible metanormative realist account. However, virtue theory challenges certain naturalistic assumptions that, however desirable they may seem, are at best vague, or trivial, or tautalogous and at worst simply false. 

A list of criteria is given for any adequate and satisfying metaethical account. These criteria are explandanda drawn from live as lived.  An account satisfying these criteria -- and explaining these explananda  is given.  This account is a virtue theoretical account that both draws support from metanormative realism and gives support to metanormative realism. Though it is incomplete and subject to important objections, the account is no worse off than rival accounts which have similar holes and suffer similar objections. 

Ethical naturalisms that are morally realist are considered. Neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism is found wanting. Scientifically naturalist moral realism is found wanting. 

Final clarifications and objections are considered.

# Chapter 1: Introduction, Flow of Arguments

### Draft 1
This dissertation defense the thesis that human virtue and human values are not part of nature in the same way that nonhuman rocks and trees and animal brains are part of nature. 

If this thesis is right then either anti-realism is true or non-naturalism is true, but ethical naturalisms (of the extant variety) are unlikely to be true. I assume that anti-realism is false until the final chapter, in which I provide a few brief reasons to think the assumption is true. Non-naturalism I argue to be the most likely true explanation for our understanding of human value and virtue. 

* In chapter 1 outline the keywords and key premises and propositions pertaining to this thesis, especially naturalism, non-naturalism in the context of the debate about values like goodness and beauty and virtues like justice, courage, or contentment. 
* In chapter 2, I discuss the historical background of this debate from Democritus and Aristotle through G. E. Moore, Arthur Balfour, and turn of the 21st century. 
* In chapter 3, I critically appraise reductive ethical naturalism as articulated and defended by Richard Boyd, Frank Jackson, Nicholas Sturgeon and others. 
* In chapter 4, I critically appraise non-reductive ethical naturalism as articulated and defended by Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, and others.
* In chapter 5, I critically appraise neo-Aristotelian naturalism, as articulated and defended by John McDowell, Philippa Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Stephen Brown. 
* In chapter 6, I further explain and defend my own view of morally realist virtue theory in relation to ethical non-naturalism. 

### Draft 2

This dissertation defense the thesis that virtue theory is the ethical framework with the most plausibility but that it is incompatible with the type of naturalism that is in 2014 is touted by 49 percent of analytic philosophers. The corollary of this thesis is that either virtue theory or such naturalism must be rejected. 

There are three kinds of people that might be interested in the arguments in favor of this thesis and against it, besides those who are generally is interested in ethics and meta-ethics. The first is philosophical naturalists who are on the hunt for a theory of morality that both takes morality seriously and rounds values and virtues and human happiness in nature. The second is those supernaturalists who are interested in arguments for virtue theory and wondered whether virtue theory is somehow aligned with a supernatural metaphysics. The third are virtue as assistants who might be wondering how their distinctly ethical theorizing connects with various broadly metaphysical frameworks.

### Draft 3

This dissertation defends the thesis that human virtue cannot be naturalized but that virtue talk is the best (most practically useful and theoretically plausible) kind of ethical theory we have. In this way, my  metaethical account that can be described as morally realist, non-naturalistic virtue ethics. 

There are two kinds of reasons to disbelieve my thesis. The first is allegedly more plausible alternative theories (or anti-theories) of morality: deontology, utilitarianism, moral nihilism of various stripes. The second is objections to my thesis. I shalI respond to each reason. But my responses will not be symmetrical. Regarding the first reason, evaluating the global persuasiveness and plausibility of a single ethical theory as a whole is hard work for one book, let alone all rivals to virtue ethics. So I shall content myself with identifying which plausibility points won by each side if it can explain a few, common, core judgments or values, like that friendship is a good thing, that is laudable to love and wonderful to be loved, and common assessments we make of admirable people. Regarding the second reason, I shall surface as many objections as I can find in the literature, learn from colleagues, and think up myself. I shall polish them up as well as possible and articulate them as sympathetically as possible and then, of course, do the hard work of refuting them as well as possible. 

My primary thesis is directed at those who already accept or lean toward virtue theory in general. For those, the reasons to accept virtue theory are redundant; for others, my reasons here to accept virtue theory are liable to be more tantalizing than persuasive. I shall point to the writings of a diverse group of virtue theorists— like Rosalind Hursthouse, Julia Annas, and John McDowell — who are different from each other in many ways but united about virtue. 

The question within virtue theory that I want to answer is this: can virtue theory be plausibly naturalistic? Are notions of virtue, happiness, flourishing, and notions of physicalism, naturalized epistemology and so on incompatible? Is neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism either Aristotelian or ethically naturalistic, but not both? I shall argue that they are incompatible. For many of naturalist orientation, this will decrease the global plausibility of virtue ethics. If the notions of virtue, along with honor, chastity, and slavery, are relics of the past, so much the worse for them. Naturalism is the philosophy of the future, for science is the philosophy of the future. But we cannot be too sanguine here. 

My secondary thesis is directed to just those who are undecided about virtue theory or already committed to one of it’s rivals. The global plausibility of virtue theory in light of a reasonable view of cosmology, politics, and psychology is very high indeed, as others before me have shown. But the global plausibility of naturalism is very high, as well. The tension between the two, if there is any tension, is cause for intellectual concern. Some naturalists have argued that the only alternative to moral realism is moral nihilism, which is such an unattractive position th

In order to make all of this tolerably clear, I shall have to define ‘naturalism.’ This is no easy task, and takes up a good bit of space in the chapter x. Naturalism we might call a movement. The momentum it has built, starting nearly 500 years ago, has crested and reached a kind of tipping point. Either naturalism will fulfill its promise of naturalizing not just the cosmos but everything else including mind and value, or naturalism will begin to ebb. Either the naturalists who have been hopeful of the research program in philosophy and outside it will make good on the last remaining pesky puzzles, or, to the astonishment of many, naturalism will prove to be not just incapable at the moment but incapable in principle of developing a comprehensive and satisfying account of both the cosmos and the mind. 



###Draft 4
This dissertation defends the thesis that virtue is a gift of God. As Plato suggested in Meno, the source of human virtue is not humanity or nature but something outside both humanity and nature. This thesis must be distinguished from a thesis in the vicinity — a thesis much debated in popular forums — about whether one can be “good without God.” I think this is like asking whether a gardener can grow plants without the sun. The answer is the gardener needs sunlight but need not believe in the sun to grow plants. Similarly, if virtue is a gift from God, then the virtuous person needs help but need not believe in the Helper to live virtuously and benefit others. 


###Draft 5

This dissertation advances the thesis that all extant ethical naturalisms are false. The corollaries of this thesis are that we must either elect for ethical non-naturalistic virtue and do so very soon, or else wait perhaps a long time some yet-to-be-defined articulation or yet-to-be-conceived conception of ethical naturalism. 

Chapter 1 reviews some of the primary discussions and attempts plausible definitions of some what are called ‘Keywords’ in the debate between naturalists and non-naturalists over ethics, including ‘nature, ‘good,’ ‘virtue’, and ‘human’, ‘practical reason,’ ‘telos,’ and ‘science’. 

Chapter 2 advances a positive version of virtue ethical theory that provides strong explanatory power over a range of moral platitudes, namely, entrenched folk moral views that seem so right, and why some sophisticated moral theories seem so wrong. Family is important. Friendship is valuable. Cruelty is wrong. The question of whether this virtue theory is ‘naturalistic’ is deferred. And the motivation for a naturalistic theory of ethics is highlighted. Some criteria for what our ethical theory should account for are negotiable (say, that my ethical theory should explain why I am always right and others wrong) and, after reflection, ought to be given up. The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are: 

1. **Action** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport; norms are action-guiding; practical reason gives reasons for practice -- that is, rational action rather than static reason and irrational activity. explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons. 
2. **Character** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials.
3. **Diverse Finite Goods** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest);
4. **Heroic Virtue **- accounting for how some exemplary good people become so good; 
5. **Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** —  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others;
6. **Diverse Normativity** — explaining the parity between epistemic and moral norms (in contrast to the absence of a parity between etiquette norms or preferences);

Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. 

Chapter X begins a critique of neo-Aristotelian naturalisms.  Aristotelian naturalism of a more phenomenological flavor proposed by Philippa Foot is critiqued. The  Aristotelian naturalism with a scientific flavor proposed by Stephen R. Brown is also examined. The problem of the fact value dichotomy is not overcome by asserting that some of human biology sets normative limits for human flourishing, happiness, and virtue. To speak adequately of all of human flourishing requires speaking of our rational nature and our biology as a union. The metaphysical problem with virtues being my virtues if personal identity has no further grounding than biology is urged. 

Chapter x critiques the “third alternative” between supernaturalism and reductive naturalism as espoused by Rosalind Hursthouse and John McDowell. The third way is a kind of groundless intersubjectivism wherein no further grounding is required, a non-transcendental idealism that avoids the myth of givenness (that some empirical truths come for free without any interference from our intellect) and the myth of objectivity (that some intellectual truths come for free without any help from our senses). The problem of moral nihilism rears its head. 

Chapter x rehearses criticism of various ethical naturalisms, beginning with non-cognitivist naturalism. If virtue ethical moral realism demands supernaturalism, then perhaps it is better to deny realism in general. But non-cognitivism (except expressivism) collapse into moral nihilism, which is not only implausible, but in light of primary, substantive normative and moral questions, morally reprehensible. Expressivism, albeit much more sophisticated and hard to exactly critique, collapses into a kind of ethical skepticism or nihilism that is inconsistent especially with Criterion 4. 

Chapter x critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the non-scientific flavor, where the good (say) is an ethical/natural property saliently different from other kinds of natural properties. It then critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the scientific flavor, where the good and other values are ethical/natural properties not saliently different from other natural properties like natural kinds. These fail to account for Criterion 3 and 4. 

Chapter x answers a few remaining objections, and considers whether (if no satisfying theory of ethical naturalism currently exists) it would be better to trust naturalism and wait for an ethical theory some day, or trust our ethical theory and abandon naturalism today, or very soon. In light of the ambiguity of the term naturalism, this final chapter concludes with some suggested re-conceptualizations of the five Keywords. 




### Draft 6

That we ought to love each other is true if anything is true. Life as lived is puzzling. Among the many puzzles that confront us, some of the most enduringly fun and bewildering are ethical puzzles about how we know what is good and whether there is a good at all.  These questions are given a special bite. 

This dissertation advances a naturalistic metaethical theory that combines moral realism and virtue theory. My thesis involves three claims: that nature consists of some normative facts and other facts in a radical continuity, that at least some those facts can be and in some cases are known, and that knowing and acting on them is (for rational creatures like us) the best way to live.

The question of naturalism will occupy much of our discussion. And it will take us into the *metaphysical* side of metaethical debates. I for one enjoy the variety of discussants and styles across philosophical metaphysicians and ethicists, but some may find the presence of so much metaphysical discussion strange alongside so much ethical discussion. 

Normative ethical theories (about duty, virtue, pleasure, the divine will, etc.) are normally taken to be competing and non-trivially distinct from metaethical theories about what grounds duties, virtues, human pleasure, God's decrees, etc. This received wisdom is wise. And yet, to paraphrase Thomas Nagel, sanity in our metaethics is most preserved by keeping primary ethical concerns near to our mind.

Explanations explain phenomena that puzzle us. There are, in many cases, competing explanations that can't both be true but that are both plausible. If I find a broken window in my home office and a stick on the ground, on the face it may be that some neighborhood menace was breaking windows for fun, or that my tree outside lost a branch in the wind. An explanation is (always?) underdetermined by the data. 
 
There are two ways to offer an explanation: as an argument (contending against others) or as a framework (aiming for consistency and coherency and plausibility). When offering the first kind of explanation qua argument it is necessary to attack other frameworks and defend one's own. When offering the second kind of explanation it is necessary to fully explicate the theory, drawing out aspects and clarifying or defending them. The plausibility of a framework then depends, for the reader, on how plausible and satisfying the framework is as a whole rather than the relatively less satisfying alternatives.

7. Objections, Clarifications, and Conclusions (What is Really Scientific)


There are two ways the reader might take my main claim: firstly, as a query about virtue ethics, whether it can be naturalistic or not; secondly, as a query about ethical naturalism, whether it can be made plausible or not. Admittedly these questions are distinct and can be treated separately. But insofar as writers like Hursthouse, Foot, and McDowell address them as a unity, I shall follow suit. 

One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocuters, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproarioiusly funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocuters are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergradutes are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to let the dead bury their own dead. 

While writing a platonic dialogue is a form of art I still find appealing and still use, that is not the best vehicle for this dissertation. So I am forced to give the views I think mistaken the best hearing I can give them in my own voice. 

The challenge of metaethical inquiry, I think, is to engage readers who do not already agree with you. A constant danger to which we are all liable is assuming too many crucial propositions and arguging at length about a bunch of relatively peripheral propositions. Metaethicists who steer clear of this danger are the likes of Alan Gibbard and Robert Adams. There is some value to articulating, clarifying, and defending a view that reader and author both (already) share. But that is not the valuable enterprise I aim for. 

The test, I think, shall be whether these pages find readers who disagree with the core thesis I present in Chapter 3, and, if so, whether they can recognize "their own" purported view in the pages that follow. If they can not only recognize but resoundingly affirm the view expressed in that chapter, then my objections may have some bite and may earn the high honor of receiving a rebuttal. 

It would not be a failure if no one found these pages; most such essays do not find readers, even if they deserve them. Failure would be for some ethical naturalist to pick up the book or a chapter on a shelf or online, glance at the view expressed, and to disown what I claim is his own. 

I have done my best within the following chapters to detail my assumptions as quasi-axioms or quasi-data to be examined and explained. I have also done my best to formalize (in short, numbered, propositional forms) the arguments I endeavor to lay out and defend in paragraphs. The benefit of offering formalized versions of my own arguments is that they may clarify for readers exactly what is being offered for their consideration. The risk of offering proposition-unit versions that are shorter than the paragraph-unit versions is that some discrepancy may arise between the two, and the readers be forced to do an initial interpretive work of figuring out exactly which argument they ought to consider. 

My theses are these:

1. There exist some real primary norms (both epistemic and ethical) that are binding on us *qua* human beings. 
2.  These norms are in some cases, knowable and effable. 

Examples of such norms are 'proportion your belief to the evidence' and 'be kind to others.' 

If such norms are 'real' then they are mind-independent, true regardless of human opinion, etc. 

If they are 'binding on us qua human beings' then they truly prescibe over all creatures with practical rationality -- in other words, all creatures like us and all other potential creatures we might discover or be discovered by one day. 

I say 'some real norms' because, of course, not all norms are real. Norms of, say, spelling English words I take to be purely or mostly conventional. Drawing up lists of exactly which norms are real independent of human thought and which are human concepts is of course a difficult task. My task is simply to defend that the list of mind-independent norms has at least one item. 

The main rivals to the above theses are epistemic and moral nihilists, expressivists, and error theorists.  Some say such norms just don't exist except as concepts or social structures. Others say that if such norms existed they do not explain how we think and talk. So the arguments that such norms really exist are metanormative explanations of the way we talk, the way we act, and the we we (necessarily) think. 

But even among those who agree with the above theses are divided. Not everyone who agrees with the first two agree with each other. These norms seem to defy fact/value distinctions. They are evaluative facts, or factual prescriptions. At least, if they are "just values" then the fact/value gap becomes a problem. If they are fact-values then there is no gap to be overcome. But some philosophers become indignant at the notion of evaluative facts: what in the world could such strange things be? 

This leads to the question of whether ethical norms are 'natural'?  Are moral facts, or what I am calling simply 'norms' natural? This seems like a pressing and substantive question whose answer will affect alot. After doing the research for this dissertation, I no longer think it is a pressing or substantive question. It is not just vague but hopelessly vague; not just ambiguous but fatally ambiguous. 

4. Are these norms "natural"?
	* Are these norms radically anamolous? Are they strange, queer, discontinuous? 
	* Are such norms physical/material? (Nagel, McDowell)
	* Are such norms divine? 
5. Where do such norms come from? Do they happen to emerge from our biology? Do they come from the mouth of a god? Are they necessary features of our rational nature and other other creatures with a rational nature? 

My claim is that: 

1. These norms are 'natural' but that the question 'Is X natural?' is almost vacuous. 
	* These norms are not radically anomolous. They are not strange, queer, discontinous.  (Nagel)
	* These norms are not material. (Nagel, McDowell)
	* These norms are not emergent properties arising from our biology. (Foot, Brown)
5. These norms are internally related to human nature (via practical rationality). (Foot, McDowell, Kant)

For the purpose of these essays, I remain agnostic as to whether these norms come from any particular personal god. But I do claim that they are divine. The contrast is likely to strike the reader as strange. By 'divine' I mean that they transcend our animal biology and that conformity to them makes us rational, acting creatures full of wisdom and virtue.  Affirming the divinity of some norms is consonant with a variety of theistic views: Aristotle's god is neither Brahman nor Jehovah. 

But insofar as 'natualist' is just a label for 'atheist,' then my argument entails that naturalism is false. But I deny the charge that my view is "non-naturalistic." Insofar as 'naturalist' is a label for 'one who believes in the radical continuity of facts, the uniformity and harmony of reality,' I vehemently claim the label as my own. In order to claim the label as my own, I must show that they are mistaken who think reality is radically continuous because reality is fundamentally physical or material. 

The best evidence that reality is not fundamentally material is human nature, rationality and practical rationality, including primary norms. 


##### Draft 7

This dissertation defends the claim that some moral and epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents, and that such norms are best explained in terms of human nature (what we are), human flourishing (our end), and human virtues which are the means to flourishing. 

There is a danger that labels, which are useful for categorization, storage, and quick reference of arguments and beliefs, become more important than substantive arguments. Let me say here how I would label my view in terms of the labels fashionable in the early 2000s, and thereafter avoid trivial disputes. I take my metaethical view to be a brand of normative realism, emphasizing moral norms but using epistemic norms as allies. I take my ethical view to be a brand of virtue ethics. Talk about virtues, human nature, and flourishing or happiness I find the most helpful in solving knotty metaethical puzzles. Sometimes, as Thomas Nagel reminds me, the only solution to metaethical puzzles is to stick to primary ethical tools. 

The main rivals to my claim are: (a) the belief that no moral or epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents; or and a group of views (b) that such norms are indeed real but best understood in other terms. There are several rivals of this second class. In order of decreasing similarity to my own conclusion, beginning with *most* similar, they are: 

|Rival claim | Thinker | Label |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|
|* b1. Real norms are best understood as features of our human nature  | (McDowell) |Ethical naturalism
|* b5. Real norms are best understood as features of our rational minds | (Kant) | Ethical Rationalism
|* b4. Real norms are best understood as features of our social group | (MacIntyre?)| Social construct
|* b3. Real norms are best understood as features of our animal nature | (Foot)| Naturalism
|* b2. Real norms are best understood as features of the "natural world" |(Boyd)| Ethical naturalism

It will be quickly noticed that several of these views fly under the heading of 'naturalism'.  Hence I move to dispense with the titles. Instead, clarifying the claims, I shall argue for and against each claim in its own terms. In the final chapter I shall pick up the question of labels and definitions, again, after the dust has settled. 

There are a series of questions to which the best answer is "there are real norms or laws of thought and behavior that govern creatures like us." I lay out [a number] of criteria for what an adequate metaethical theory should explain. These criteria are, I hope, non-controversial, eminently common phenomena that we can all relate to. 

My first task in defending my primary thesis *could have been* to rehearse some of the arguments against normative nihilism, norm expressivism, etc. Instead, I shall argue that normative realism is a reasonable "defeasible presumption"[^14] that we ought to trust unless weighty objections arise. I then show that 'naturalism' provides exactly such weighty objections. But 'naturalism' is a a "philosopher's weasel-word."[^15] A naturalistic thesis, when clarified, will turn out to be one of a few kinds of thesis: 

[^15]:  Borrowing Terrence Cuneo's term from *The Normative Web*. 

* a trivial common sense metaphysical thesis; -- all that is real is real 
* a slightly less trivial anti-idealist metaphysical thesis; -- all that is material is real
* a universal reductive materialist thesis;  -- all that is real is material; nothing that is real is non-material
* or an atheistic thesis; -- nothing that is real is supernatural (i.e., God) [^16]

[^16]: Some might think that the reductive materialist thesis is for all intents and purposes identical to the atheistic thesis. But idoloters think that their god is material and pantheists think that matter too is god. 

So I reframe the so-called 'naturalists objection' in these three ways. The core objection I call the "argument from radical discontinuity."  The argument from radical discontinuity, or disharmony, finds various expressions in various books and articles but has, I think, one root. That root is important and true. I show how my account satisfies that search for radical continuity. So how does my account fare with respect to so-called naturalism, after disambiguation? I detail how my account 

*  agrees with 'naturalism' qua trivial metaphysical thesis; 
* disagrees with 'naturalism' qua reductively materialistic thesis
* does not disagree with 'naturalism' qua atheistic thesis. 

		It is indeterminate with respect to theism or atheism, though it fits better with theism. (My account makes theism more plausible and atheism less plausible. But it is not inconsistent with atheism nor does it entail theism. I call such a weak relationship a "fit" but indeterminate.)

		Some will find it strange that I argue for *holiness* without necessarily invoking religion, or *divinity* without necessarily attaching it to a god. It is strange, but not uncommon. Laozi's eternal Tao is divine without being a god. Aristotle's *nous* is a god without being a person. Even Kant's Christian God is not quite Swinburne's Christian God, with purposes, plans, and personality. I take my argument to be a conclusion about signs. The nature and reality of the signified is a whole different discussion. Could someone, beginning from the existence of a sign that most clearly points to a signified, make an argument that the signified in fact exists? Yes. Could someone else deny the signified, reinterpreting the sign? Yes. But both acknowledge and admit the existence and nature of the sign, including that it seems to point beyond itself. That's all I can hope for here. 
	

With these clarifications in hand, I proceed to examine the various rival views as espoused by their best proponents.  They all accept the reality of evaluative norms but explain them differently, offering different metaphysical frameworks and anthropological frameworks. I attempt to show in detail how each rival either misteps or goes only part of the way in the right direction. It misteps by invalidating one of our criteria. It only goes part of the way by only including some of our criteria, ignoring or disregarding the others. 

Having removed the teeth from the overriding motivation to be "naturalistic", these rival views turn out simply to be half-hearted substitutes for virtue. They are not even properly "rivals" nor are they clear-headed. The clear-headed work to be done is to clarify objections to virtue theory and articulate better answers and explanations. 

Finally, I consider objections that might show my claim to be false or otherwise inadequate (implausible, trivial, or useless). The biggest of these is that my conclusion does not "secure" the natural world from "outside" influence. The fear can be variously expressed: *You have not protected us from god.* Since I do not think that such laws are circuscribed to *humans*, the fear that there may be something or someone *else* out there -- be they aliens, angels, or gods -- is not a fear that should disturb our rational reflection on these questions. I reflect on the relation between my claim and theism. 

The conclusion of all this is that some kind of virtue theoretical account is not only truest but most useful. My claim, if true, helps to vindicate the excellent work in virtue ethics that is being done all over the world. It also vindicates the practical work of those leaders, parents, politicians, medical doctors, pastors, and professors, who deploy terms like 'virtue' and 'happiness' to motivate themselves and others in their care. 

The essays comprising this dissertation unfortunately defy categorization. The normative considerations in the first and last chapters might be called applied ethical. After all, we are trying to give good reasons and hear good reasons for our metaethical theory in order to *know* what to do with our ethical theories, and we care about our ethical theories (in part) because we care about our lives. We want to lie well, not badly. The "metaphysics of ethics" we must do (in response to Kant and Frank Jackson) to get a hold on human nature and the norms to which we are naturally sensitive requires a bit of metaphysical legwork. And, of course, there will inevitably be some room for moral epistemology, semantics, and moral motivation. With the great danger ever present that on any of these various topics I will mistep, I trust in the reader not to scoff but to correct, not to laugh but to help me learn.  




#Chapter 2 Literature Review (Historical Background, Keywords)

##On the Concept of Nature
John Dewey described himself as a naturalist. I am not sure what he meant by this self-ascription. I am not sure anyone else is sure. What does the term naturalist mean? 

Those who hope for any help from etymology will be disappointed. The word nature comes to us from Latin natura. The Greek correlate is physis, which means roughly “that which grows” [^1]

[^1]: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοιφύσιν αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature.) Odyssey 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray).

Aristotle distinguishes nature from art by nature having in itself the source of motion while art has its source of motion from without. The Oxford English Dictionary lists a bafflingly wide range of entries on the term nature.  The major supergroups are senses relating either to “bodily strength” or “mental or physical impulses” or “innate character.” Examples include sexual urges of an animal, the character of a human, essential qualities of anything, including God. A sermon from 17th century preacher Robert South on Job urges that “God would not act sutably, and congruously, to the Equity and Goodness of his Nature, if He should not reward it.”  [^10]

[^10]:  "nature, n.". OED Online. December 2014. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/125353?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=TLHvuY&amp; (accessed March 06, 2015).

John McDowell describes himself as a naturalist by which he means to avoid the “fear of supernaturalism"[@mcdowell.mw 84] 

McDowell would find it strange to hear from Reverend South a discussion of the nature of God called a naturalistic discussion, but it is hard to see how McDowell or anyone can block such usages of the term except by excluding them by definition.

###A quick example of non-overlapping sets of definitions for overlapping sets of terms
Keywords: Nature, Practical Reason, Human, Science, Goodness. Humans are part of nature, and so is goodness, and it can be known by science.

Compare these two statements: 

1. Humans are merely wetware meat machines, and goodness is whatever property conduces to our biological flourishing and genotype reproductive success, and such properties can be discovered, categorized, and exhaustively researched by physical, biological, psychological, and sociological sciences.

OR

2. Humans are one of the entities in existence, and so is the form of good, which can be known, and goodness is whatever participates in the Good, which for us is the flourishing of our rational nature, which can be known and taught through tradition, including metaphysics, psychology, ethical inquiry, revelation, and experience.

Both deploy the keywords above systematically. But the interlocking system of meanings of each term individually together in these sentences is different. The metaethical frameworks deploying these keywords might seem incommensurable. I don't think they are. Two consistent systems can be judged relative to eachother by picking out one or two particular claims each makes and discerning which seems most likely to be true. The "winner" of that judgment points us to the system in which it is embedded. 




##Democritus and Lucretius
While this dissertation’s main interlocutors are contemporary, it helps to include some older friends and foes in the conversation. Considering the historical context of a debate is often useful, sometimes irrelevant, but never harmful. However abstract, timeless, and almost mathematical the arguments for and against a proposition, it sometimes helps to know who has defended and attacked it before, how they have done so, and what other truth-claims and behavioral maxims are organically related to that proposition. 

For this reason, I begin my literature review not with G. E. Moore but with Democritus. 

The theorizing of Democritus is important for my purposes in two ways: his end (continuity) and his means (matter). (1) He desired an account that afforded radical continuity of explanation. And (2) his account found that continuity in material objects. 

##Lucretius
Lucretius puts the lie to the whole notion that modern materialism, or contemporary physicalism, is a recent discovery and a sort of philosophical upshot of the modern scientific revolution. 


##Arthur Balfour and Lloyd Morgan

About the same time that G. E. Moore was busy inventing analytic metaethics, the British philosopher and politician Arthur Balfour was composing a fascinating monograph called *Theism and Humanism.* Arthur Balfour’s *Theism and Humanism* develops an argument from naturalism against naturalism that runs as follows: 

&gt;[There is] no distinction to be drawn between the development of reason and that of any other faculty, physiological or psychical, by which the interests of the individual or the race are promoted. From the humblest form of nervous irritation at the one end of the scale, to the reasoning capacity of the most advanced races at the other, everything without exception (sensation, instinct, desire, volition) has been produced directly or indirectly, by natural causes acting for the most part on strictly utilitarian principles. Convenience, not knowledge, therefore, has been the main end to which this process has tended.[@balfour 68].

And again: 
&gt;Taking naturalism as our guiding principle we can hardly doubt that the august sentiments which cling to the ideas of duty and sacrifice are nothing better than a device of nature to trick us into the performance of altruistic actions.[@balfour 15]

In my own words: 
any conclusion is false if the conclusion of the argument contradicts the objective truth-finding ability of the very faculty of reason by which we gathered the premises in favor of the conclusion.  
Let A be the proposition that: reason is a truth-finding faculty that is at least occasionally reliable at discovering true propositions. 
Let B be the proposition that: Natural selection is responsible for the state of the current state of the brain, its functions, abilities, etc. 
And let C be the proposition that: Natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties. 

1. If A then B.
2. If B then C.
3. A. 
3. B.
4. Therefore C. 
5. If C, then not-A. 
6. Not-A. 

1. The brain exhibits truth-finding properties, then we can learn that natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties. 
2. If natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties only,  4. natural selection is entirely responsible for the brain's functioning, 
3. The brain exhibits truth-finding properties
4. natural selection is entirely responsible for the brain's functioning, 
If natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties only, then the brain does not exhibit truth-finding properties. 
5. The brain does not exhibit truth-finding properties. 



This argument type is picked up by a philosophical if popular journalist (G. K. Chesterton in *Orthodoxy*), a philosophical and literary scholar (C. S. Lewis in *Miracles*), and contemporary philosophers (Alvin Plantinga in *Where the Conflict Really Lies*, and Thomas Nagel in *Mind and Cosmos*). 

The problem with the argument is not only that it contains a contradiction (that is bad enough). The problem is also that it undermines *all truth claims* including, of course, the truth claims that lead us to believe in things like natural selection. 

Lloyd Morgan’s review of Balfour’s book calls it “one of the most remarkable books of modern times.”[@morgan] Yet he differs from Balfour’s conclusions on almost every point. His responses are instructive. Morgan sees that natural selection produce humans, but that humans and rationality have advanced beyond the initial state produced. Natural selection, we might say, is only the indirect producer of human rationality, ethical ideals, and so on. 

Furthermore, naturalism is not opposed to supernaturalism. “[W]e are far from denying the existence or the all-pervading influence of the supernatural ; nay, rather we are laying firmly the foundations of a belief based not on rationalism, but on idealism. We contend for the natural and intrinsic nobility of man at his best and highest, and see therein the foundations of his religious ideals.”[@morgan 84] Morgan does not flesh out these contentions much. But he somehow sees in naturalism not a refutation of “supernaturalism” or idealism but a basis for it. 

Morgan’s naturalism is simply a method of sticking “close to the realities that are given in practical experience; and to remember that every step in analysis takes us so much further from the reality from which we start.”[@morgan 86] By this light, the physicist who says a tree in the next field is “nothing but matter and energy” and the psychologist who says the tree is “nothing but sensations ... combined” may both be right but there is also a tree in the next field. The bottom line is that the “criterion of reality” is “direct experience” rather than “that which remains after the most ... rigorous analysis” [@morgan 88]. Morgan affirms both sides of the objective/subjective divide, whether the results of intense experimental study or intense introspective analysis, since “nothing ... can be more real than a bit of practical experience in the moment of that experience; and if in analysis we distinguish therein an objective aspect on the one hand and a subjective aspect on the other hand, let us remember that these two are of strictly co-ordinate reality.”[@morgan 89]

##G. E. Moore
G.E. Moore is well known as a non-naturalist. He is less widely-known as a consequentialist. My thesis combines metaethical realism with virtue theory and so includes but does not limit itself to consequentialist theses. Consequentialism is opposed to virtue theory, but not diametrically opposed. 


## Contemporary Naturalism of a Paradigmatic Sort
Contemporary naturalism follows Democritus and Lucretius on the two main points, the end goal and the means thereto.

According to David Papineau, naturalism is not just a banner under which to gather or a vacuous slogan like “world peace!” Alyssa Ney argues that naturalism is not a truth claim with propositional content but an oath or a vow to follow science wherever it leads. In this sense, I am a naturalist. According to Alvin Plantinga, naturalism is simply atheism plus. In this sense, I am not a naturalist. When avowing a term requires appending a series of checkboxes detailing what one does and doesn’t mean by the term, it seems high time to either rethink or retire the term.

#Chapter x - Six Criteria Lock, Virtue Key (My view)

This chapter advances my view. 

My metaethical theory is a positive version of virtue ethical theory that provides strong explanatory power over a range of moral platitudes, namely, entrenched folk moral views that seem so right, and why some sophisticated moral theories seem so wrong: Family is important. Friendship is valuable. Cruelty is wrong. The question of whether this virtue theory is ‘naturalistic’ is deferred. And the motivation for a naturalistic theory of ethics is highlighted. Some criteria for what our ethical theory should account for are negotiable (say, that my ethical theory should explain why I am always right and others wrong) and, after reflection, ought to be given up. The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are: 

1. **Action** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport;
2. **Character** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials.
6. **Diverse Normativity** — explaining the parity between epistemic and moral norms, modal "norms" or laws, aesthetic norms (in contrast to the absence of a parity between etiquette norms or preferences);
3. **Diverse Finite Goods** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest);
4. **Heroic Virtue**- accounting for how some people become so good they are exemplary, they become saints or sages; 
5. **Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** —  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others; we know for instance that cruelty is bad and kindness good more firmly and clearly and irrefutably and incorrigibly than we know some obvious non-normative facts like that ice is cold or objects fall toward the earth (the exceptions are imaginable, even though surprising); 
7. **Practical Reason** - explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons. 

Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. 

Each of these needs a defense. 


#### Draft 2

1. **Good (values, truth, beauty, goodness, order)- Unity and diversity of non-human and human goodness** - The star are beautiful, the ecosystem is healty, the bee hive is flourishing, a solar system is forming, that father and son are finally reconciling, their friendship has lasted, the truth is good, goodness is real, virtue is its own reward, rational beings ought to proportion belief to the evidence, real scientists don't fabricate data, simultaneously to hold inconsistent beliefs makes one irrational; accounting for  evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest); [The plurality of goodness, varieties of goodness, varieties of value]
 * Order is good in a very different way from truth.


2. **Virtue (moral and intellectual)- Uniity and diversity of human goodness in chracter, thought, action ** - accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials. 
	* That was wrong, but you're not a bad person; 
	* Pat did well for once; 
	* accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport; norms are action-guiding; practical reason gives reasons for practice -- that is, rational action rather than static reason and irrational activity. explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons.
	* Parents ought to care for their children and children ought to respect their parents;
	* Friends ought to remain faithful even in times of sorrow and trouble;
	* Word and deed, thought and action, intellect and will -- these exhaust what we judge ourselves and others for
	* Examples: 
* those people are courageous; 
* Sam is wise;
* Jose did the right thing, 
* Lindsay has earned it; 
* Willfully to disregard the evidence for historical atrocities against people groups whom you happen to dislike is an intellectual *and* a moral error
* Ignoring evidence contradicting your hypothesis is an intellectual error;
* Falsifying evidence to support your hypothesis;  

3. Unity and diversity of human individual and collective good. 
* As political creatures, if the family, society, and state are flourishing, it is likely to be easier for me to flourish.
* As individuals, if I am flourishing it is likely to be easier for the polity, the society, and the family to flourish. 
* Often times promoting the general welfare demands that I sacrifice my personal welfare -- or at least my personal pleasure, comfort. Example: %
* Often times promoting the specific welfare of myself, my family, or my friends demands that I sacrifice the general welfare -- or at least the general convenience, efficiency. Example: Giving children the right to an education means helping even first-generation families to struggle through all the challenges of enculturation in school. 

	
3. **Moral knowledge and ignorance -- Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** —  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others;
	* I am more certain that I ought to honor my father's memory than I am that atoms exist. 
	* I am more clear that I ought to care for my children than I am that Pluto is or is not a planet.
	* I am more justified in believing that I ought to trust my wife when I am absent than I am justified in believing that most of the dinosaurs were eradicated by a catastrophic cosmological event. 
	* Cruelty is wrong, kindness is good; to be open to reconsidering these platitudes constitutes a moral failing. 
	* Under this heading we can say that we seem so obviously to *know* certain moral judgments are true (cruelty is bad, kindness is good) and that they are true *about* certain moral facts (crulety, kindness)
 
4. **Superlative human goodness**  - that firefighter is paragon of courage, Sam is a sage, Jose always does the right thing, Lindsay deserves every blessing she has; accounting for how some exemplary good people become so good; how some people become exemplary villains, examples of vice, debasement, wretchedness, and misery. 


Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. 

Each of these needs some comment. Objections could be levelled against my choice of explananda to the effect that cherry-picking explananda is a way of fixing the race in favor of one or another future explanation. 

	All that God made is good. Jack and Jill live in a beautiful meadow. Jack is a virtuous fellow and Jill wise. Their children are decent, but they have big shoes to fill. I'm not sure whether Jack is a doctor or a farmer, but he has helped me and my family. 


My reply to this objection is that (a) other theories *could* account for them; virtue theory just accounts for them more and more satisfyingly, and (b) each explanandum is a common, obvious, public phenomenon that calls for explanation. They are not the *only* things puzzling about live as lived, but they are major puzzles. 

To defend the first criterion, I have assembled a sort of sample from art, literature, reality television, anecdotal examples, history, and political discourse. The specimens of this sample are not, clearly, chosen at random. They were chosen with the criterion in mind. If my point were to show the features of a random sample, this sample would be a poor one. But that is not my point. Rather, I am to show *how easy* it is to gather examples of normative evaluations of various kinds deploying identical (English) terms for an apparent diversity of phenomena. 



# Chapter x Virtue Theory of a Paradigmatic Sort


The explanans I prefer and shall defend against a few of its rivals is a morally realist virtue theoretical account. The criteria laid out [in chapter X] I have already defended in part. The worst academic sin I could commit early on would be to beg the question against a rival explanans merely by cherry-picking explananda. But other possible pecadillos remain. [I shall attempt to rebut below those that seem most threatening.]  

In this chapter, I shall spell out a paradigmatic sort of morally realist virtue theory, drawn from Aristotle with modifications by Aquinas with extra modifications by MacIntyre and others. Needless to say, one need not be a Roman Catholic theist to appreciate what is true in Aquinas’ account any more than one need be an aristocratic Greek polytheist to appreciate what is true in Aristotle’s account. 

I shall say only briefly what exact sense (out of a dozen possible senses) I mean by ‘morally realist’. The reader may rest assured that I mean nothing radically new or unique here. I shall then [spend a bit more time to] make explicit how metaethical discourse enriched by words like ‘virtue’, ‘happiness,’ and ‘harmony’ can satisfy the criteria above; how such discourse explains — individually and as a group — the puzzling facts about humanity and normativity. 


## The criteria/explananda
Let’s recall our explananda: 

* A good person is one who has achieved a good set of character traits and employs or “activates” them habitually; a bad person is the opposite. 
* Evaluative discourse about people, judging them as good, beautiful, faithful, friendly or the opposite of these, paradigmatically consists in judging not only their actions but especially these character traits. 
* Some people are not just decent but exceptionally admirable, heroically virtuous. 
* Evaluative discourse about everything else deploys value terms like goodness, truth, beauty and their opposites to describe or evaluate non-human objects (stars, rocks, forests), non-human animals (deer, dogs, buzzards), and systems (ecosystems, galaxies) according to normative canons other than moral ones. (Cf. (Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, Chapter 3 “Well-Being and Excellence”).  
* There is a parity between evaluative discourse endorsing moral norms and evaluative discourse endorsing epistemic norms (where there is no identical parity between evaluative discourse about, say, etiquette).  
* Evaluative discourse purports to be objective. 
* Some evaluative judgments purport to be known with an absolute and incorrigible certainty while others purport to be only guessed at, hoped for, glimpsed “through a glass darkly.”

Michael Smith summarizes the "features of morality" as (1) "we seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts" and (2) regarding practicality, "moral judgments seem to be, or imply, opinions about the reasons we have for behaving in certain ways and, other things being equal, having such opinions is a matter of finding ourselves with a corresponding motivation to act" (Smith 1994, 6-7). Of course, Smith thinks these features are opposite each other. Beliefs  -- correct or incorrect -- about facts are "utterly distinct" from desires, and never the twain shall meet (Smith, 1994, 8). 


## Virtue Theory in general virtues and vices
To quote Philippa Foot, “virtues are, in some general way, beneficial.” Virtues, like frankness or courage are habitual activities that benefit the possessor and the community of which the possessor is a member. 

Foot thinks it a weakness that Greek sense of arete and the Latin sense of virtues include non-moral excellence. Robert Adams thinks this a strength, since moral excellence (he argues) is a species of excellence per se (Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, Chapter 3 “Well-Being and Excellence). 

Practical wisdom was counted as a moral virtue by the ancients, while we see it as an intellectual virtue. Which is it? Wisdom is connected, according to Foot, with action or the will, namely “knowledge of how to act well” in general matters such as friendship, marriage, parenting, and career, and knowledge of how to pick good ends. “Cleverness” may be knowledge of how to coordinate efficient means to any end, but wisdom “presupposes good ends” (5). A second part of wisdom, Foot thinks, has to do with the “curiously elusive” that that “some pursuits are more worthwhile than others” (6). Borderline cases are always liable to dispute. But someone who consistently values (say) worldly position over health and family relationships I judge to be foolish in that regard, and I assume most of my readers agree. 

Foot also argues for her version of Aristotle’s dictum that “virtues are about what is difficult for men” (8). That is, for any given virtue (such as justice) there are temptations — often strong temptations — to do what is vicious (such as overweening desires for wealth or overweening fear of criticism). 

Foot considers one puzzle about virtue theory that gave Kant much trouble. If virtues are “correctives” to tempting errors endemic to human nature (like the temptation to overindulge in the sensual), then is someone who struggles and works hard to do well more or less virtuous? Suppose a man does not steal when his circumstances practically beg him to steal: he can easily get away with it, no one will know, the thing he could steal will greatly benefit him and its loss will not greatly harm its owner, etc. He seems more virtuous because he overcame more in his pursuit of virtue; he seems less virtuous because he had to employ extrinsic motivation to get himself to do good. Kant concluded that actions done for other motives besides dutiful motives don’t have moral worth (Cf. Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, I). Foot charitably offers only one corrective to this conclusion: “Some actions are in accordance with virtue without requiring virtue for their performance, whereas others are both in accordance with virtue and such as to show possession of a virtue” (13). An action done in accordance with virtue (like self-preservation) but that does not ‘display a virtue’ has little to no moral worth, because it arises out of natural self-love. But that same action, under different circumstances, may display virtue — as when someone is strongly tempted to suicide but resists, preserves themselves, through courage and hope. Similarly, doing an action that one finds enjoyable (even if that action is philanthropic action) is in accord with virtue but becomes a truly virtuous action when it is done in the face of resistance. 

&gt;Can virtues be used to bad ends? For example, can the villainous criminal persist in robbing a bank through his great courage? Since it is “good for a blind horse to be slow” it would be worse in a sense for an avaricious man to be courageous. There seems to be some analytic contradiction in saying ‘courage makes him bad’. That trait that benefits him harms him. Should we give up the intuitive definition of virtues as bestowing benefits? What are the alternatives? Either courage is not a virtue or the bank robber’s action is not courageous. Foot considers that the power a virtue typically has may not “operate characteristically” under certain circumstances. [@foot2003n 16-17]

&gt; In this example we were considering an action in which courage was not operating as a virtue, without suggesting that in that agent it generally failed to do so. But the latter is also a possibility. If someone is both wicked and foolhardy this may be the case with courage, and it is even easier to find examples of a general connexion with evil rather than good in the case of some other virtues. Suppose, for instance, that we think of someone who is over‐industrious, or too ready to refuse pleasure, and this is characteristic of him rather than something we find on one particular occasion. In this case the virtue of industry, or the virtue of temperance, has a systematic connexion with defective action rather than good action; and it might be said in either case that the virtue did not operate as a virtue in this man. Just as we might say in a certain setting ‘P is not a poison here’ though P is a poison and P is here, so we might say that industriousness, or temperance, is not a virtue in some. Similarly in a man habitually given to wishful thinking, who clings to false hopes, hope does not operate as a virtue and we may say that it is not a virtue in him.

## Virtue theory in Stephen Brown

Virtue theory is hard to characterize. What distinguishes it from deontology and utilitarianism, its major theoretical rivals? 

* Not "emphasis", since utilitarians and deontologists can emphasize virtues (Brown 2008, 12).
* Rather "the difference between these three views lies in the different reasons a proponetn would provide to explain why the virtues are good to have... how the virtue are justified... how their goodness is explained" (Brown 2008, 12)
* A virtue theory is on in which "as Statman puts it, 'the basic judgements in ethics are judgements about charcter'" or ones in which "the concept of a virtue offers th emost useful *criterion* for the rightness of an act." 
* Aristotle's virtue theory argues that a good human life is by definition the exercise of virtues, implying that virtues are not only worth having but the only goods worth having. 
* Brown's virtue theory is "moderate" in that virtues are not "theoretically fundamental" but "ethically fundamental" (15). 

Invoking a distinction from Roger Crisp, Brown distinguishes between virtue ethics (which prescribes advocates virtues) and virtue theory (which engages in virtue talk). 

Brown's rivals are not other ethical naturalisms but non-naturalists and non-cognitivists. He hopes to beat them in overall plausibility -- reading 'plausibility' as having an account that "accords with our pretheoretic ideas and intuitions about the ethical phenomena in question" (16). 



## Virtue theory in Foot/Hursthouse

Virtues benefit their possessor

##Normative Realism
Consider first a phenomenon I shall call a Parental Directive. Parental Directives are norms delivered to virtually all young people by their guardians (parents, or older siblings, nannies, grandparents, etc.). We are introduced as children to evaluative discourse not in the abstract but in regard to concrete and particular actions, attitudes, and people. We are told, depending on the family’s disposition, that we ought not to yell in public, or that it is good to finish our vegetables before desert, or that if we hit our siblings we will be punished. Evaluations of behavior, especially our own behavior, come early and often. The purport of Parental Directives is objective. That is a sophisticated and academic way of saying that as children most of us knew, or learned very quickly, that if we disobeyed a Parental Directive we were really in trouble. And not just that we were in trouble with our care-givers, but that we had done wrong. Freud made much of this primordial sense of guilt. I do not propose to psychoanalyze, to praise, or to blame this sense of guilt. I merely propose to notice that it is a psychological state belying a belief, a belief (even in young children) clear and distinct. That belief is something like the conviction “If I break the Directive, I am in big trouble. I ought not break the Directive.” What Parental Directives show us is normativity in the wild. 

Consider a second phenomenon I shall simply call Civic Law. A Civic Law is any law, statute, constitution, directive, rule, code, guide, command, decree that is enjoined by a governmental institution (be it monarch, senate, or township council) on its people. Despite centuries of speculation of purely hypothetical “a state of nature” before humanity joined together into governments, as far as historical fact is concerned humans have been communal creatures for all recorded history. The Code of Hammurabi, one of our earliest archeological finds, is a code. It is a monumental exhibit of Civic Law.

Consider a third phenomena I shall call Story. In stories that we tell each other, from mythology, folk tales, family anecdotes, and Hollywood films, certain patterns are universal. Characters face struggles and must overcome them. Characters (especially comic ones) exhibit flaws. 

Consider a fourth: Hagiography. Technically, hagiography is an art form that belongs to religious traditions. But I am treating a hagiography as a broader practice of encomium, a way of praising an exemplary person by simply telling their story and “getting the word out.” 

Consider a fifth phenomenon I shall call Intelligentsia. In any society, there are “the wise” or the intellectuals. These hold themselves and are held to higher standards of honesty, accuracy. 

What these phenomena highlight is that human life as live is drenched in normativity, moral and otherwise. And a full and adequate metaethical theory ought to give some account of human life as lived, as far as possible. 

We can see in Parental Directives and Civic Laws several of the puzzling phenomena we began with. Parental Directives show (6), and (1) and (2). Hagiography demonstrates (3) that some people are heroically virtuous and (6) the purport of objectivity. 


##David Enoch — Taking Morality Seriously 

Another recent thinker who has advanced a thesis with some similarities is Israeli philosopher David Enoch. David Enoch's persuasive argument is that any alternative to objectivist moral realism, whatever its merits, doesn't account for or allow us to take morality sufficiently seriously -- as seriously as we already do, or as seriously as we must do — especially for deliberation about what to do. Moral realism of the robust sort gains its plausibility from allowing or explaining why we take morality just so seriously -- as serious as life and death. 

Enoch's claim is not the same as Nagel's, but bears an important relation: Nagel claims that reasoning as if morality were objective is practically necessary, that we cannot but do so. Enoch claims that since we reason as if morality were objective (we take it very seriously) we ought to explain the fact by the best explanation, namely that morality is indeed objective. 

I take these claims together to be an explanandum and explanans. There are many ways of trying to convince people to take morality less seriously, by showing it up, by exposing it, deflating it, showing what moral claims "really" amount to, and so on. Peter Railton claims that some people can take morality too seriously even though they are avowed subjectivists. He says 

“Some may be drawn to, or repelled by, moral realism out of a sense that it is the view of ethics that best expresses high moral earnestness. Yet one can be serious about morality, even to a fault, without being a moral realist. Indeed, a possible objection to the sort of moral realism I will defend here is that it may not make morality serious enough” (Railton, “Moral Realism” 164). 

An objection Enoch might make (or that I shall make in a Enochian spirit) is that there are two kinds of earnestness. One is an earnestness in doing good. The other is an inevitable earnestness in caring about what we do when we deliberate. Enoch emphasises the second. Railton’s non-reductive but naturalistic morality may account for the fact that people sincerely and eagerly care about doing right but it doesn’t account for the way we in fact deliberate. 
Enoch summarizes his moral realism in this way: 

&gt;"I believe that there are irreducibly normative truths and facts, facts such that we should care about our future well-being, that we should not humiliate other people, that we should not reason and form beliefs in ways we know to be unreliable. These are, of course, just examples: even if I am wrong about them, I believe there must be some examples of this sort, examples of normative (and indeed moral) truths that are irreducibly normative, truths that are perfectly objective, universal, absolute. They are independent of us, our desires and our (or anyone else’s) will. And our thinking and talking about them amounts not just to an expression of any practical attitudes, but to a representation of these normative truths and facts. These normative truths are truths that, when successful in our normative inquiries, we discover rather than create or construct. They are, in other words, just as respectable as empirical or mathematical truths (at least, that is, according to scientific and mathematical realists)." 

##David Enoch Chapter 3 - Argument from Deliberative Indespensibility

Enoch’s book defends moral realism against various familiar or not-so-familiar objections. His primary positive argument for moral realism (or what he calls “robust moral realism”) is, in short, that normative facts feature indispensibly in our deliberation and tha the reality of normative facts is the best explanation of that indispensability. He says, “ I argue that irreducibly normative truths, though not explanatorily indispensable, are nevertheless deliberatively indispensable – they are, in other words, indispensable for the project of deliberating and deciding what to do – and that this kind of indispensability is just as respectable as the more familiar explanatory kind. Deliberative indispensability, I argue, justifies belief in normative facts, just like the explanatory indispensability of theoretical entities like electrons justifies belief in electrons.” (Enoch 2011, 50; Enoch 50)

We can trace a prototypical version of this argument from deliberative indespensibility to Plato’s Parmenides.  In this most difficult of Platonic texts, Parmenides (the character) advances “the most difficult” objections to realism about universals, and despite Socrates (the character)’s inability to respond to them, affirms realism. Why? In the absence of appropriate rebuttals of objections, why retain the belief? Because the alternative thesis is impossible to rationally maintain. 

“But on the other hand,” said Parmenides, “if anyone, with his mind fixed on all these objections and others like them, denies the existence of ideas of things, and does not assume an idea under which each individual thing is classed, he will be quite at a loss,  since he denies that the idea of each thing is always the same, and in this way he will utterly destroy the power of carrying on discussion. You seem to have been well aware of this.” “Quite true,” he said.“Then what will become of philosophy? To what can you turn, if these things are unknown?” (134-135c). 

Philosophical theories that are self-refuting or doctrines which are sets of propositions of which some contradict each other are theoretically impossible to affirm. Similarly, practical maxims that are self-refuting are impossible to act upon. Reality (formal reality) is what philosophical inquiry is about.  If philosophical inquiry is just about our shared concepts, or just about the history of falsehoods held by great dead philosophers, or just about rationality itself, then we had better use our time elsewhere. 

Enoch doesn’t think that there have been any good or good enough response to Gilbert Harman’s challenge that unless normative facts can feature in our best explanations. “The general thought seems clear enough: moral facts do not play an appropriate explanatory role (the No Explanatory Role Thesis), and, given that playing such a role is necessary for justified belief in the existence of a kind of fact (the Explanatory Requirement), we are not justified in believing in moral facts”  (Enoch 52). In a footnote, Enoch distinguishes his account from that of Regan: “An emphasis on the point of view of the deliberating agent – central to my employment of the second strategy of coping with Harman’s Challenge – can be found in Regan (2003) and Rosati (2003). At times, Regan’s claims are very close to my own, except he thinks such line of thought only defends realism “for practical purposes” (2003, 656).

Enoch addresses a preliminary worry or objection that something’s indespensibility need not signify its truth or reality. But the same (or indistinguishably similar) worry would have to be applied to electrons and numbers. Rather, he appeals to the properly basic procedure of concluding that something exists on the basis of its indispensability to certain kinds of explanation. “We usually take that something is theoretically useful to be reason to believe it, and perhaps we should rest content with that as a fairly basic epistemic procedure, as one place where epistemic justification comes to an end.” Enoch defends the proposition that inference to the best explanation is a properly basic epistemic procedure, like relying on modus ponens or perception or memory. 


Enoch distinguishes explanatory indispensability from deliberative indispensabilty, which he explains this way:  “Something is instrumentally indispensable for a project, I suggest, just in case it cannot be eliminated without undermining (or at least sufficiently diminishing) whatever reason we had to engage in that project in the first place; without, in other words, thereby defeating whatever reason we had to find that project attractive” (69).

In short: “The deliberative project is, then, intrinsically indispensable (or at least – it is intrinsically indispensable if the explanatory one is). If it is instrumentally indispensable for the deliberative project that p, we are justified in believing that p. At least, we are every bit as justified in so believing as we are in believing the conclusions of inferences to the best explanation (from warranted premises). If, then, it can be established that irreducibly normative truths are deliberatively indispensable, we are every bit as justified in believing in them as we are in believing in the explanation-friendliness of the universe, and, derivatively, in electrons” (71).

Terence Cuneo explores indispensability in this way: 
An “elimination stopper” is something that is “necessary for engaging in anything we would ordinarily recognize as theorizing” (Cuneo 229). 
“Theorizing—that is, accepting, evaluating, and formulating theories (however inchoate in character) of various kinds—is arguably an unavoidable practice for ordinary human agents; it is difficult to imagine a recognizably human way of life in which we do not engage in it. If this is right, it follows that epistemic facts are indispensable in at least this sense: They are such that participation in certain practices that are themselves practically unavoidable commits us to their existence.1”
	Certain epistemic norms are just so indispensable. 


Enoch then argues that deliberation is just so indispensable. There are arbitrary choices (between this or that cereal) and there are choices where the outcome really just depends on you or your choice (how happy will I be in profession X?) But in deliberating we “attempt to eliminate arbitrariness by discovering (normative) reasons, and it is impossible in a believe absence of such reasons to be discovered” (74). In some cases of choosing, you “commit yourself to there being (normative) reasons relevant to your deliberation. 

One review summarizes the argument in this way: 

(1) Moral beliefs concern something objective. (2) If Robust normative facts are indispensable for deliberation, we have some reason to believe in them, and thus to accept Robust Metanormative Realism. (3) Insofar as we have reason to accept Robust Metanormative Realism, we have reason to accept Robust Metaethical Realism. (4) Robust normative facts are indispensable for deliberation because alternatives to Robust Realism that are consistent with (1) and with normativity’s role in deliberation fail. (5) None of the metaphysical, epistemological, semantic or psychological objections to Robust Realism are significantly damaging. (6) Therefore, we have most reason to accept Robust Realism in both metaethics and metanormative theory. (David Faraci’s review, accessed online http://personal.bgsu.edu/~faracid/pubs/enoch.pdf
 I argue that iexplrreducibly normative truths, though not explanatorily indispensable, are nevertheless deliberatively indispensable – they are, in other words, indispensable for the project of deliberating and deciding what to do – and that this kind of indispensability is just as respectable as the more familiar explanatory kind. Deliberative indispensability, I argue, justifies belief in normative facts, just like the explanatory indispensability of theoretical entities like electrons justifies belief in electrons. 

##David Enoch, Chapter 4 - And Now, Robust Metaethical Realism

Enoch argues that moral normativity is a species of normativity, and that the distinction between normative and non-normative is much more important than the distinction between moral norm and non-moral norm. 

“With this point in mind, then, asking about the relations between the moral and the normative becomes the question of how to delineate the moral within the normative. What more, in other words, does it take for a normative truth (or falsehood) to qualify as moral? Morality is a particular instance of normativity, and so we are now in effect asking about its distinctive characteristics, the ones that serve to distinguish between the moral and the rest of the normative.
I do not have a view on these special characteristics of the moral. In fact, I think that for most purposes this is not a line worth worrying about. The distinction within the normative between the moral and the non-moral seems to me to be shallow compared to the distinction between the normative and the non-normative – both philosophically, as I am about to argue, and practically. (Once you know you have a reason to ф and what this reason is, does it really matter for your deliberation whether it qualifies as a moral reason?)” (Enoch 86). 

His argument does not depend essentially on distinguishing moral norms from non-moral norms (88). 

&gt;“Why are people so suspicious of morality, robust-realistically understood? Sometimes the worries are metaphysical – moral properties, or truths, or facts, or values, or duties, or some such are said to be metaphysically queer, not to find a comfortable place in a naturalistic worldview, and so on. The merits of such worries are a matter for Chapter 6, but my point here is much more limited: if you think that things like the purported fact that we ought not to humiliate others is metaphysically queer, you should be equally metaphysically suspicious of things like the purported fact that two-boxing is the uniquely rational policy in Newcomb’s Problem. If you find it hard to metaphysically stomach things like the value of humanity (or the negative value of pain), you shouldn’t (prima facie, at least) find the value of excitement more appetizing. If the scientific worldview can’t find room for the wrongness of murder, it is hard to see how it can find room for the irrationality and (sometimes) irresponsibility involved in wishful thinking. The metaphysical worries about morality seem to just be instances of metaphysical worries about normativity more generally.”

In short, if one finds false the notion that all reality is ultimately material, is there any *other* reason to doubt moral realism? Moral disagreement is the greatest one. Moral disagreement is an especially cutting objection against virtue ethics. 

Enoch’s discussion of the (supposedly) devastating objection that moral properties or moral entities, if they existed, would be queer. He clarifies and diffuses many iterations of this objection.  Section 4.3 suggests that moral realism is “especially suspicious” among metanormative theories because moral reasons are categorical (93). There is a difference here between realism about (say) epistemic norms and realism about moral norms which are or are supposed to relate somehow with our motivations. 

Enoch’s fourth chapter ends with a kind of challenge.  In the absences of better objections to his view or arguments in favor of rival views, he conjectures “that no such further consideration can be found. But my argument here is open-ended in this way, and so my conclusion can perhaps better be thought of as a challenge: if you cannot find a flaw with the arguments of the two previous chapters, but want to resist the further conclusion of Robust Metaethical Realism, you had better be able to come up with a rationale for the surprising combination of views you find yourself with” (99). 

David Enoch Chapter 5 Doing with Less - Against naturalism)
“This chapter critically discusses three families of attempts to give the metaethical or meta-normative realist pretty much all that she wants, without resorting to the metaphysical extravagance of Robust Realism. The first is an attempt at a kind of naturalism that accommodates (by reduction, with this word sufficiently broadly understood) normativity. Naturalism is rejected mostly by emphasizing the thought that normative truths and facts are just too different from natural ones to be a subset thereof.”

Most to my purposes, in its way, is Enoch’s fifth chapter. He characterizes the naturalistic viewpoint by first stating a few possible theses that would qualify as naturalistic: 

&gt;“Now, as already hinted, it’s not clear what the precise naturalist claim would be.2 Suggestions in this area include things like the following: normative facts just are (identical with) natural facts; normative facts are reducible to natural ones; normative facts are metaphysically grounded in natural ones; normative facts are constituted by natural facts. And further distinctions may be relevant here. For instance, we may want to distinguish – even if we’ve settled on an identity claim – between type–type and token–token identity. Furthermore, it’s not as if the terms just used (in any of these suggestions) are philosophically transparent. It is, after all, not at all clear, and far less is it uncontroversial, how reduction is best understood, or how grounding is to be distinguished from constitution, or – perhaps most clearly – how the natural is to be understood and delineated. So there are many, many suggestions that a fuller philosophical treatment would have to distinguish and evaluate piecemeal. Without pretending to cover everything in the neighborhood that needs covering, then, let me make a fairly concrete suggestion about how to capture the naturalist thought, and then argue against it. I have to concede, though, that nothing here will qualify as a conclusive argument, much less will it qualify as a conclusive argument against all possible roughly-speaking-naturalist positions here” (101). 


What Enoch settles on is what he calls the nothing-over-and-above relation. In the debate, robust moral realists affirm the resolution that there are moral facts (or properties or truths etc.) over and above the natural facts; naturalists deny the resolution. 

&gt;“When I speak of irreducibly normative (and moral) facts, I use the term “reduction” and its relatives somewhat loosely, to pick out the nothing-over-and-above relation. According to Robust Realism, then, there are moral and other normative facts that are not merely natural ones; according to Robust Realism it is just false to say of (all) the normative facts that they are nothing over and above natural ones. The relation between the normative facts and the natural ones is not like that between statues and “their” lumps of clay, or between chair-facts and facts about their structure and function,7 or between mental facts and physical facts (according to the monist)” (102).

# Chapter x - The objection from nature -- Radical Discontinuity

The belief that 'nature is it' and 'science studies nature' has arisen from heresy to orthodoxy. 
The objection from naturalists about morality or practical reasons is that they are not 'natural.' They are not real. 
They are weird, queer, strange, sui generis, unprecedented, unexplainable, mysterious, obscure, opaque, supernatural, preternatural, and (of course) unnatural. 

But what else is weird like norms? 

1. Modal facts
2. Intentional facts -- I am thinking *about* Hawaii
3. Mathematical facts
5. Logical facts

##Examples of the radical discontinuty objection

"There is a common feeling, at least among naturalists, that explaining ethics only in terms of one kind of 'stuff' -- namely, natural stuff -- is a desirable thing, if it can be done" (Brown 2004, 7). 

"A fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature" (Brown 2004, 4).

	[In the last chapters, we have set out the criteria by which a robust and satisfying metaethical theory can explain what is most puzzling about our lives as practical reasoning creatures, and we sketched — albeit quickly — the skeleton of such a metaethical theory. That sketch invoked not only thin evaluative contrasts like ‘good/bad’, and ‘right/wrong’ but also thick ones like ‘courageous/cowardly’ and ‘happy/miserable.’ That sketch gave especial weight to the notion of human nature and tried to specify the distinctly human goods belonging to us by nature. Those goods we called person, interpersonal, and communal. They included individual flourishing of mind and will in intellectual and moral virtues, but the joys of friendship, camaraderie, and the joy of romantic love, including but not limited to reproduction, and social flourishing within family and polity or community that functions with harmony and justice. All of these, or something like them, rather than simply genetic proliferation, seem to us to be the human telos, if anything is.
	
	Three sorts of responses are likely: 
	
* “That all sounds about right. But much more needs to be said to clarify, disambiguate, and substantiate these claims.

* “That doesn’t sound right. I have a substantive objection to one or more claims in your sketch.”

* “That all sounds about right. But how do we naturalize it? How do we ensure that your sketch is consistent with naturalism per se?”
Responses 1 and 2 will have to wait until later chapters. This chapter, and the next few, will be about the project of naturalizing virtue theories of which my sketch in the last chapter is a token.]

## Foot 

### Summary of *Natural Goodness*

Philippa Foot’s original theorizing has earned her many admirers and critics. Rosalind Hursthouse is a follower. From Wittgenstein’s highly idiosyncratic and penetrating chains of reasoning, Elizabeth Anscombe and Foot took inspiration to form their own style of writing and theorizing. 

Foot’s ethical naturalism is one of two or three kinds of virtue theories that are avowedly naturalistic. What exactly qualifies each as ‘naturalistic’ will of course be a subject of some dispute in the discussion that follows. But each of these virtue theorists lays claim to the title or banner of naturalism. So we will consider each in turn. 

Foot’s theory as expressed in Natural Goodness I take to be the following theses:
1. The semantic meaning of evaluative terms like ‘good’ follows the same semantic structure as other terms — this is the ‘conceptual pattern of natural normativity’. 
2. Norms govern each living biological organism according to its natural excellence and defect. 
3. Humans are living biological organisms.
4. Norms govern humans according to its natural excellence and defect.
5. Among the norms uniquely governing humans are norms of practical rationality. 
6. 

After explaining how natural normativity applies to humans, Foot addresses the objection related to what I have called the anomaly or "just too different" objection, that humans are saliently distinct in kind from plants and animals in that humans are rational. She does think that our rationality is sui generis among the animal kingdom. Other animals act but we *act on reasons*. We choose on rational principles (Aquinas) or act on *logos* (Aristotle). Animals, by contrast, and small children, *incline* this way rather than that. They may pursue ends but they do not pursue *ends qua ends*. A sheep sees green grass but does not *see that* the grass is green and that green food is most often healthful. Animals participate in choice as they participate in knowledge. Crows can be said to know that X will lead to Y [@crows 1][@crows2] but they do not know X *as a means* to Y. The distinction may seem arbitrary but Foot thinks (and I agree) it is important. Seeing something *qua end* is not a special mode of perception over and above visual perception nor is it something we can discern through "Lockean introspection" [@foot2003n 55]. Rather, following Wittgenstein, it has something to do with language. Humans use language to justify and explain choices. Children come to use language in this way. As she says, "When we say that human beings are able to choose *on a rational ground* as no animal can, it is because human action belongs in such surroundings, and so, ultimately, because humans use language not matched by anything in animal life." [@foot2003n 55] A formula she provides that I find helpful is this: animals pursue the *good they see* while humans pursue *what they see as good.* An animal may display hesitation when "torn between hunger and fear" or like Buridan's ass torn between two desires, but there is no behavior in the animal whose explanation demands we posit rational deliberation. 


This objection is closely related to another objection (presumably from a moral skeptic or immoralist) that perhaps we have no reason to do what good human beings must do. This objection concedes that 'action A is necessary for being a good human' but asks "What if I do not care about being a good human being?" [@foot2003n 52] She borrows a question from Gary Watson who wonders whether any morally realist theory can show that being a gangster is incompatible with being a good human being" [@foot2003n 53]. She wants to show that it is. 

###Foot and Nagel's Rationalism
Foot's rationalism sounds a lot like Nagel's. For Nagel, we simply see some states of affairs *as* grounds for doing this and not that; we see some states of affairs as justifying acting rightly or forbidding wrongly. My child crying with hunger I see as grounds for feeding her. My son playing too roughly with my daughter I see as grounds for removing him from the room, even though his tears of protest match or equal her tears of pain. My memory that I promised to read a student's paper before Friday strikes me as grounds for staying up a little later to read it, despite feeling ready for bed. Foot says we "shouldn't be allowed to get away with a claim to 'just see' that a reason exists" [@foot2003n 58] There are different kinds of "shoulds." One "should" go to the bank to prevent an overdraft and one "should" stay home recovering from the flu.  These shoulds are relative to the circumstances. There is also a should "all things considered." This second kind of should we can say is not relative to the circumstances, or we can equally say it is relative to the fixed set of all the circumstances. In one context, the fact that a man is my father may be reason to take care of him in old age; but in another context it is not reason giving. 

If we have considered context and all extenuation circustances, it is possible that certain facts are reason giving full stop. If we have considered all things, we can utter an "overriding or final 'should'". For instance, suppose I'm leaning toward grading the student's paper. I think, *well, I promised to do it, and though I am sleepy, there are no extenuating circumstances that make it unwise for me to lose a little sleep. I can sleep in, or catch a nap, tomorrow, and no one's life depends on my being especially alert, and I'm not out of coffee grounds, etc.* All things considered, I ought to go ahead and grade the student's paper. 

Foot thinks that to not do what I *should do all things considered* is irrational. 

She doesn't think that morality is just a system of hypothetical imperatives, though she argued it an in earlier essay.[@foot1972morality] The truth behind her error was that desires and interests are always intimiately related with our actions and motivations. That is, desires *may* be reason giving. "A desire to see the Taj Mahal can in the right circumstances make it rational to plan a trip to India and visit a travel agent; and similarly the knowledge that cigarettes are carcinogenic can rationalize giving up smoking by showing that it is in one's interest to do so." [@foot2007n 61] But they are not *always and necessarily* the only reason giving reasons for action. 

And this is the mistake with which she is less patient:  the dogmatic belief that desires simply must always necessarily be the "real" reasons behind action. She bluntly asserts a plurality of fundamental motives and challenges the philosophical dogma to defend itself against those ostensive facts. She presents "all sorts of causes" that might explain an action: habits, imitation, nostalgia, ritualistic symbolism, and conscience. 

&gt;What tells us that conscience cannot explain action? Someone may give as the explanation of his action a thought about right and wrong, and it may be a true explanation, as Kropotkin clearly supposed in his story of Maklay's decision not to photograph his sleeping servant. So offhand we have no reason to suppose that acting as conscience demands has to be brought into a special mould, as of a belief and a ‘conative state’, before we can see it as a genuine explanation of what someone does. If we like, we can say that someone whose action is explained in this way is ‘wanting to do what is right’; but now we are simply expressing the agent's intention in terms of wanting, not showing the explanation as fitting a favoured mould. [@foot2007n 61-62] 

I find this reasoning persuasive. 

Foot details an article from Warren Quinn to the effect that the concept of rationality includes an evaluative aspect, namely that it aims at the good. 

	This fits with what we have sketched in our normatively realist virtue ethical framework. Practical reason just *is* that faculty that aims at the good. 
	
Foot summarizes: 
&gt;Earlier in the book, in Chapters 1–3, I gave reasons for believing propositions about natural goodness and badness in various plants, animals, and human beings; for instance, for believing that an individual oak tree with superficial, spindly roots was to be evaluated as defective, and, passing to human beings, gave reasons of the same form for the assertion that Maklay would have acted badly had he photographed his sleeping servant.

What must a good person do? A person acting rationally is acting well and acting well is acting rationally. To ask for a *reason* why one should act *rationally*, that is, *on reasons at all* is in some way to be confused or absurd. Jack asks for a reason why he should act on reasons because he is confused: he thinks at the moment that 'desire' is a reason for acting because it has motivational force "built in", and that any other 'reasons' for acting must be just abstract propositions with no motivational force. Jill asks for a reason to act on reasons because she is absurd: she sincerely affirms at the same time in the same respect that one ought to phi and one ought to not-phi. Jill we cannot help with arguments, but (perhaps) with therapy. Jack we cannot help with arguments, at least, not traditional arguments. He probably needs a good deal of Socratic questioning to allow him to think through what he really thinks. 


That the phenomenon happens I do not contest, though some may. But I wonder why. 










##Practical Reason






### Responses

“But the belief that the word ‘good’ must mean something different in the former and the latter is, I think, simply a prejudice coming from the type of ethical theory that has dominated analytic philosophy in the past half‐century” (Foot, Natural Goodness 39).[@foot2003n 39]

Foot here confuses one error with another. Certainly the belief that the word 'good' is special is _part_ of the prejudice of many 20th century analytic philosophers. That may be an error. But is it "simply" that prejudice? I think not. The other error in the vicinity is the belief that reality is bifurcated at its root into the normative and non-normative, or the ethical and everything else. Normative facts, on this error are just very different from all other facts. On the one hand, modal facts seem to be more akin to normative facts than other facts, since propositions describing modal facts describe states of affairs that nowhere obtain at the moment and may never obtain. "If heated up that rock must melt." And "Necessarily, each member of the human species will one day suffer biological death." The truth of these propositions, it may be argued, depends on our empirical observation. We, or rather some scientist, has observed of this or that rock at such-and-such a temperature, and we (most all of us) have observed human beings (in pictures or in life)die of old age, sickness, injury, violence, or accidents. But have we ever *observed* the modal fact that all humans *must* die? No, we infer it as a kind of nomological principle D, abstracted from a list of examples of human death. If I listed as a-z the (relatively few) deaths we have actually observed it would be a. This fellow died; b. My grandmother died, etc. Then add them to the (perhaps thousands) of deaths I have heard about from sources I trust. We still only have a sample of a few thousand. That tiny ratio (thousands of billions of currently living humans) of a sample is supposed to justify a principle D that ranges over all possible human beings, past, present, and into the unlimited future, and even fictional characters. My point is not to challenge the inference; it seems as true and well-founded as an inductive inference can be. My point is that the proposition with a modal operator D is different from the propositions a-z without.  And D seems to me appropriately described as a *fact*. 

Even so, if you find moral facts bizarre, then modal facts and other normative facts are liable to seem equally bizarre, or similarly bizarre for the identical reasons. They are just too different from other facts. 

Another error is the thought that properly basic beliefs are not justified unless we can justify them by non-basic methods, as when some physicists deny the solidity of a brick because they know it's "not really" solid. But our account of subvenient things like atoms and molecules can and should explain our knowledge of supervenient things like solidity.  

The bottom line for Foot's naturalism is that it is true but not complete. To go part of the way is not the same as to go the wrong way, but it is still not sufficient. "For to say that [human operations  ""could be evaluated in the same way as...plants"] is possible is to imply that some at least of our judgements of goodness and badness in human beings are given truth or falsity by the conditions of human life."[@foot2003n 38] And this implication is correct, she defends. Natural normativity governs plants and animals and humans in the same way. All have function and all can achieve or fail to achieve that function. A pattern of life is indexed to each species; its good is specified and the defects by contrast to those qualities conducive to its good.

Each member of the species lives out a particular life in a context or environment. Even if it has species-specific "virtues" it may fail to survive or reproduce. She mentions that a swift deer as well as slow can run into the hunter's trap. 

Is the human good reproduction? Stephen Brown all but says yes. But the objection is that people who willfully avoid reproduction to not seem to us to be ipso facto defective. Sterile couples who wish to procreate but cannot rightly lament, for reproductive difficulties are tragic. But bachelors, celibates, homosexuals, who might but do not wish to procreate might seem to us not only normal but even exemplary in their self-control and devotion to their mission or calling. All this Foot can accommodate. She says "the teleological story goes beyond a reference to survival itself." [@foot2003v, @foot2003n ]

I hesitate to play the ultimatum game and say that this is a sine qua non of human rationality. But I cannot understand those who look at all of human life, our forms of life, our elaborate way of hunting, cooking, eating, and storing our food, our elaborate way of building structures for ourselves, our scientific journals, our space program, our international trades and laws, our arts, music, poetry, dance, and theater, and all the helter-skelter that makes human civilization buzz -- I cannot understand, I say, someone who can keep all this in view and countenance the thought that "all this is just so we can survive." 

The reason I find it so obvious that all of human activity is for *happiness* and not merely survival is that survival is a necessary but not sufficient condition for all or most of our intentional actions. 

Some things have no survival value but give value to survival. We survive *for the sake*  of thriving, we don't thrive for the sake of surviving. 

The thought that "well, despite appearances, survival is the telos of all living things" if true, would guarantee that "all intentional human activity is for the sake of survival". But surely if the evidence suggests that we deny the consequent, then rationality demands a denial of the antecedent. If the antecedent is above rational scrutiny, if it is nonfalsifiable, then what we have is not a rational conclusion but an irrational dogma. 

One whose dogmatic belief in Darwinian explanations does not allow them to see the plain facts cannot claim to be more rational. They must cling to their mantra, and trust in the magical ability of propositions from neo-Darwinian theory like "survival is the only goal of biology" to help theory triumph over common sense. One small slip up and they could see the truth. 










## Stephen Brown Chapter

Brown's project is to advance the cause of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism.  His opening lines are these: 

&gt;Human beings are a species of social animal for which there is a characteristic way of life. An individual human being may be evaluated as good or bad according to how wall that indvidual realizes the human way of life. I argue that there is teleology in nature; that the fact/value gap -- however we reasonably construe that idea -- is not an overriding concern; and that neo-Darwinism is no threat to the theory. (Brown 2008, 1)

Brown's aim is to defend a species of ethical naturalism that is cognitivist and in which "important ethical norms and evaluations are grounded in natural facts." (2008, 2). He does not reject outright but rather brackets the supernatural. And he defines 'nature' as "what[ever] our latest and best science tells us it is" including psychology and sociology along with physics and biology. 

What is the explandandum for ethical naturalism? There are several. Each may need to look to its own science for an answer. 

* How an individual comes to have the norms he or she does: psychology, personal history. 
* How a group comes to have the norms they do: sociology, anthropology, etc. 
He admits, and seems melencholically resigned to the fact, that what we "end up with [might be] a mere description and not, alas, a justification..." (Brown 3)

The metaphysical framework in which Brown wants to build ethical naturalism is this: nature is teleological. (Compare Nagel's natural teleology and ) He doesn't want to reduce ethics to biology or physics, but to explain ethics in "terms of the *rest* of nature" (Brown 5, quoting Bernard Williams). But what is the "rest of nature?" Especially if human beings are radically continuous with nature, as he avers, why do we even keep such locutions as "the rest"? He means that "the rest" of nature includes non-human stuff (rocks, stars, trees) and non-ethical human stuff (psychology, biology, culture, etc.). But wait. Does ethical naturalism have to ground normative facts in non-normative facts? No. He, along with Nagel, finds this dogmatic starting point unjustified. Rather, some normative facts are brute (for their domain at least) and ground other normative facts. These natural normative facts are natural teleological facts. "Teleology allows us to infer normative conclusions" (Brown 5). 

He also wants to account for our criterion [x] that ethics seems objective. He also wants to account for the sense that ethics can be or should be a science or something like a science or continuous with another recognizable science or (at the very least) not inconsistent with other recognizable sciences. 

### Social Utility 
As a social group, we have a common good. For Aristotle -- and Brown seems to agree -- your good, my good, and our social good are intimiately interrelated. 

Social and political pluralism has pros and cons. Brown hopes a naturalistic ethical theory may be of some use in negotiating the "methods of dealing with conflicts among divergent belief systems" (2008, 10). Rather than rooting putative ethical truths in contentious religious claims, we may hope to root ethical truths in a universally accessible nature. We may hope to have "freedom *of* religion as well as freedom *from* religion", enjoying whatever truths might originate from a religious tradition without relying on that religion (10). We may hope that the one thing that unites us, our common human nature, may be a source of commanility in guidance on how to live. 


### Telos and Function - General considerations
The way we discover our common nature is by examine our *ergon* (our proper work). Brown says that this ergon is almost *function*, but not quite. He summarizes Aristotle's famous argument that *eudaimonia* is our good but seems to favor the second argument. 

&gt;If we know a thing's function, then we can easily figure out what it is for the thing to function well. A thing's functinong well is its best good. Thus, if we know what the function of a human being *qua* human being is, then we can figure out what it is for a human being to function well, and this well functioning of a human being is the best good for that sort of being. (Brown 23)

The function of a thing, in Aristotle, is the work it performs that is not also the function of other things. Each thing like 'hammer' has a differentia from all non-hammers -- namely, pounding or hammering. And each type of hammer has a differentia from other hammers: framing, finishing hammer, mallot, sledge, etc., all pound but pound different objects or do so differently. But human beings live and grow and metabolize like plants; we sense perceive like horses, oxen, and other animals; our ergon 'expresses' or 'requires'  *reason* (or as Foot would have it, speech). Our function is to reason; our good is reasoning well. 

How reasoning well relates wth virtue is a bit trickier. Are virtues simply (by definition) the reasonable activities? If so, then the connection between reason and virtue remains tight. But if not, they need to be connected. 

I was illuminated by Brown's discussion of three related concepts:

* the human good
* the good human being
* good for a human being

Here is one way of putting it: If virtue is the human good, then a good human is virtuous, and virtues are (as we say of spinach and broccoli) "good for us." By "virtue is the human good" we seem to mean our good qua species. By "good for us" we mean something more specific to individual members of the species. Something related to the human good is good for us in that it feels good, actualizes our potential, fulfills us, perfects us, or something like that. 


### The function of artifacts and natural kinds
What is the function of a horse? Brown's discussion effectively explores all the options here. Unlike a knife or other artificial object, the function of a horse would not be defined by human artifice. Nor is a horse's function or ergon obviously some work relating to human use (riding, pulling, etc.). It is implausible to suppose that a species is indexed to another species, that a the species is incomplete without being used by humans; furthermore, the individual jobs horses do might be more effectively done by other species (oxen, etc.). But horses have been in some part bred by humans for human purposes (riding, showing, fighting, hunting). So it might be that the *current* breeds of domesticated horses *are in fact* more like knives than wild dogs. Even so, what about other non-domesticated horses? Either they have no ergon at all, or their ergon is something unrelated to human artifice. 

Take the first option: horses have no ergon, no function, no discernable final cause, no unique activity they do that nothing else in nature does. Does this option mean we are giving up on "natural teleology" for biology? Plato and Aristotle both speak as if all of nature was teleological. So it would mean giving up on the platonic or Aristotelian version of teleology, for whatever that is worth. But Plato's teleology in the *Timaeus* is admittedly mythical and speculative, while Aristotle explores non-teleological explanations of natural phenomena in his *Physics*, the he says that "Nature does nothing absurdly or to no purpose" (*De Caelo* 291b14). So we haven't quite given up on Aristotle yet. Rather, we need to hear how, if at all, he articulates the natural teleology of individual biological species. 

### An argument by analogy?
Brown highlights that Aristotle's argument by analogy amounts to a rhetorical question with which he is trying to "badger" us.  Aristotle's human craftsmen have jobs or functions -- the carpenter works with wood, the horse trainer trains horses, and so on -- so are we to say that humans have no function?

* Humans A, B, C, etc. (qua roles we play, mothers, fathers, craftsmen, etc) all have functions. (via observation)
* Therefore humanity (qua species) have functions. (via inductive generalization)

* Humans (qua members of the species) are like craftsmen.
* All craftsmen have functions. (via observation)
* Therefore humans (qua species) have functions. (via analogy to first premise)

But in what way are humans "like" craftsmen? Aristotle's argument crucially depends on whether one accepts the fundamental comparison between humans qua biological creatures and the roles humans play. 


### Contemporary methods
Brown's suggestion is to apply more familiar methods for finding function. Suppose we find a mysterious artefact in an archeological dig. How would we discover its function? We would compare it to similar known objects of the same time and place, if possible. If there are no similar objects, then we might use the object for various purposes to ascertain what it does (not just what it does *uniquely well*). Of course, multiple objects do the same thing: Brown mentions that phones and email both communicate across long distances. 

His example doesn't tell. The "primitive human stumbling across various items" does not have time to familiarize herself with the telephone and email. He does not mention that, given time and/or instruction, the primitive human would discover what we industrialized moderns already know: that email is most often best for asynchronic communication, and phone most often best for synchronic communication. 

Regardless, Brown suggests that the biologist looking at organs "faces similar problems"  (Brown 2008, 30). She can compare the functions of similar organisms; if no similar organs are forthcoming, she can see what it *does*. And she can "look at the organ from an evolutionary standpoint" -- that is, "see what effects the existence of the organ has on the survival and reproduction of the organism" (Brown 2008, 30). This last does not invalidate the Platonic/Aristotelian method of looking for what the organism does best, but supplements it. 

### The human function
So what about human beings qua species? Forget my individual telos for a moment. When we examine the function of any old item of human life, say, a knife, we see that it cuts. 
&gt;What is the purpose of cutting vegetables? To prepare them for cooking. Why prepare vegetables for cooking? So we can eat them. What is the purpose of eating? so we can go on living. The series could stop there, but one could continue on and ask what the purpose in living is. In that we confront an existential question. (Brown 31-32)
He briefly considers just ending the series by repeating the last answer: we eat in order to keep living, and we live in order to keep living -- the end. He also considers that the question loses its species-indexed meaning at this point and becomes member-indexed -- what is *my* purpose.

##Smith's Moral Problem
The moral problem is the conjunction of three truths that all seem true but also cannot all be true. 

1. Moral norms are objective; moral judgments are true (mind-guiding).
2. Moral norms are practical; moral judgments are good (action-guiding).  
3. A belief cannot motivate and a motivation cannot believe (Hume's psychology). 

Smith's solution is an 'ideal-agent' solution. Whatever I would desire if I were fully rational is the moral thing to do. The problem [as we have seen] is that such hypothetical statements about the hypothetical peron's hypothetical desires justify complete skepticism. We just don't, and can't, know what a rational person would desire unless we are rational.









##Kant's critique of empirical ethics
We ought not dwell for long on Kant's metaethical project, but his critique of "empirical ethics" is helpful to my purpose. 















##McDowell's critique of empirical ethics in bald naturalism
The critique we find in McDowell is the "just too different" point. Bald naturalism, as a realm of unbroken and perhaps unbreakable law, is just too different from the space of reasons. 

McDowell agrees about Foot's rejection of supernaturalism and of naturalistic subjectivism. [@mcdowell.mvr]















#Chapter X -  Some Metaphysics of Ethics - "Naturalism?"

The primary thesis I am defending is that norms are real features of reality on par with and radically continuous with other real things, be they abstract (natural laws) or concrete objects of various kinds (trees, stars, and mollusks). Knowledge of these norms may be difficult or may be easy. Some cases I have offered for consideration are exceedingly easy for normal rational agents. These I have called 'primary norms.' Primary norms include norms like *it is good to be rational* and *love one another* and *life is good*.  

The question of 'naturalism' I have tried to show is hopelessly vague. The question of 'naturalism' is not, however, meaningless. Teasing out the concerns of naturalists and non-naturalists we discover three clear questions: 

1. Is all that is real physical/material? 
2. Is all that is real real? 
3. Is all that is real divine? 

The second question is just the tautology 'what is real is real' phrased as a question. As such, the answer is Yes. 

1. Is all that is real physical/material? 
2. Is all that is real real? 
3. Is all that is real divine? 

My answers to these shall be: 

1. Is all that is real physical/material? No. 
2. Is all that is real real? Yes. 
3. Is all that is real divine? Not necessarily. 


## 1. Is all that is real physical/material? Physicalism? 

But the question of the reality of x has become for us embroiled in the question of the *physicality* of x. 

The question "is x real?" has often become for many analytic philosophers "is x natural?". I concede to the equivalence. The question "is x natural?" has become for many "is x physical/material?" Since physics as a discipline is undergoing such an overhaul, questions about whether x is physical should be deferred to a distant and uncertain future. But we know what matter is by ostensive definition: "the stuff my computer is made of." I shall take matter, not physical stuff, to be the more basic notion, and even the more scientific and respectable notion.  

The equivalence between reality and nature and between nature (phusis) and matter is, for those who are puzzled by such metaethical questions, the source of the puzzlement. 

In regards to the above list of explananda, we listed some diversities that seem different. 

The problem of the one and the many, as it pertains to metaethics, is this: what if anything unifies all the varieties of value we both *recognize* and *live by*?  

This is what I mean by saying that we are looking for *radical continuity*: what root unifies or might unify these diversities? They are unified in our language and in our thought. Are they really unified in themselves?

There seems to be one kind of goodness distributed across many different but ultimately related kinds. The good of intellect and the good of will are unified, for us humans, in goodness. But the good of beauty, excellence, moral virtue, order, and being itself are not obviously or easily reducible to human goods of intellect and will. I argue that they are not easily reducible because they are not in fact reducible at all. 

For the physicalist, there is no option but to so reduce them. What unifies human goods is just that they contribute to human welfare. Human welfare we must read as a particular configuration of matter (perhaps my and everyone else's brain states being thus-and-so). What unifies all non-human goods is humanity: that is, what all putatively "non-human goods" have in common is that evaluations of them appear in human discourse. 

This is all very misguided. But the problem is the means. The end is correct, however misguided the means. The goal of unification is one we deeply desire and preverbially yearn for. We all want a  satisfying account, a way to understand the whole world a global and radical continuity. We all want to understand the world and our place in it, if there is such a place to be understood. 

The way back on track, then, is to suspend belief in physicalism for now, to suspend the way we use the terms 'nature' and 'science,' and stick to a discussion of normativity in light of a broad and plausible metaphysical framework. 

That framework is a faith in the fundamental proposition that reality is intelligible and hence some (though not all) of our theorizing about reality stops no shorter than reality itself. 

I find it telling that some critiques of my thesis have not said "You are wrong" but "there is no possible answer to your questions because reality is unknowable". The person who tells me I am wrong still believes in truth. The person who tells me reality is unknowable has given up on the inquiry. They are not part of my conversation. If they are right, then by their own lights, my theory of reality is just as fantastic as theirs. They ought not go around criticizing other people's fantasies on the basis of their own fantasy. But if, as I think, a bad theory is not fantasy but falsehood, then a good theory is not pleasing fantasy but truth, they ought to correct both themselves and me. 

That is, the moral nihilist predicates her moral theory on metaphysical nihilism or skepticism. I predicate my metaphysical realism on moral realism. Since I know it to be good to help starving children, to train my natural children, to be faithful to my friends, to be gentle and kind to my wife, therefore I know knowledge of reality is possible. There are many moral truths, lamentably many, important ones, that I know I am ignorant of. But not these. These are non-negotiable. Openness with respect to the badness of cruelty is a base, dangerous, and noxious openness. Openness with respect to these true ethical judgments would be just as bad as being closed with respect to negotiable ethical judgments like that felons should not vote or that divorce should be illegal. The question is not "is it good to be open-minded or close-minded?" but "about what should one be close-minded? what open-minded?"



## Aristotelian Nature Telos Chapter 
Discussions of putatively "Aristotelian" or neo-Aristotelian elynchthics self-consciously import some Aristotelian metaphysics. But how much? The linchpin is Aristotle's notion of telos.

Aristotle's metaphysics can be characterized around a few broad themes: 
1. Form and matter;
2. Actuality and potentiality;
3. Causation: final, formal, efficient, and material; 
4. Substance and nine types of property; 

Of course, his epistemology cottons on to his metaphysics. To know X is to actualize the mind with respect to the form of X; to know X is to be informed by X. Knowledge is the telos of intellect or %νους. The intellect that is being actualized by the actualities/forms of objects in the world is itself an object of the world. The intellect being actualized is fulfilling its nature (its form). Fulfilling a nature means realizing a telos inherent or coordinate with the form. 

### Telos

Some philosophers talk of telos as if it were a separable portion of Aristotle's unified metaphysics. I am not so sure.  [^5]

[^5]: I am thinking of people like Canadian metaphysician Kathrin Koslicki who said during the Q&amp;A of a talk that telos had been "surgically removed" from her hylomorphic metaphysics. "A Hylomorphic Analysis of Concrete Particular Objects" But surgical removal of an essential organ kills the patient. 

Metaphysically, the reason telos is the linchpin is that without telos, formal structure does not exhaustively account for an organism. A very old book on biology argues that biologists are often split between form based and function based biologies, between anatomy or physiology [@russell1916]. For Aristotle, such debates are needless. Formal cause and final cause together (with material and efficient of course) constitute an organism's true identity. 

Epistemically, knowing the form of x without knowing the telos of x is a good start but only part of the way to knowledge of x. 

####MacIntyre 

MacIntyre's *After Virtue* tells a story. Our predecessors had an understanding of the virtues that allowed them to individually and collectively pursue the human good together. We moderns have fragmented virtue and now we are trying to put it back together again. But the problem is not just that we moderns lack virtue; we lack an understanding of virtue combined with a partial understanding of several incomplete fragments of virtue. 

The solution is, first, to get perspective on the problem behind the problem.  The “problem behind the problem” is the Enlightenment abandonment of telos for individual human persons and whole human communities or political units all directed towards one shared human good, the personal and political virtues being in this frame the means to that telos. The solution to that is the personal and political restoration of a shared conception of a good — better yet, a shared recognition of the real good — and a realignment with the broadly Aristotelian tradition in cultivating the virtues that are by definition means to that telos. 


MacIntyre is clear that the loss of telos in our worldview is the loss of truth. So why would an ethical framework appeal to Aristotelianism without telos? I can't see any good reason. One reason that is not a *good* reason is that we have been bullied to reject certain scientific truths by a dogmatic philosophical minority. Is it too bold to respond to such bullying by... just saying no? I revisit this question below. 


#### R. Scott Smith
How naturalistic is this virtue ethic? [I have argued that we cannot simply adopt the title for social reasons if we deny the majority view of what nature is.] How Aristotelian is neo-Aristotelianism? We ought not expect that every jot and tittle of Aristotle be preserved as sacred, but we ought to expect that some of Aristotle’s own core commitments overlap with a neo-Aristotelian’s core commitment. 

R. Scott Smith argues that MacIntyre’s virtue ethics assumes realism (Smith, Virtue Ethics and Moral Knowledge). Without the assumption, it loses coherence.


#### Telos in Stephen Brown
Naturalizing teleology  Stopped on page 22, Ergo and Fucntion


#### Telos in Nagel
*Mind and Cosmos* argues persuasively that the concept of nature wherein teleology and teleological laws are surgically removed is false. The excise of teleology is no part of the definition of natural science. Amateurs studying the history of natural science and the reflective practictioners within it bear this out. 

#### Naturalizing Purpose Philippe Huneman (2006)

#### Telos and Final Cause
1. Is our final cause survival and reproduction?
* It seems that it is for survival and reproduction are the final cause of all living things, all organisms on the tree of life.
* Furthermore the drive for survival, Metabolsis, and reproduction are the only processes that all living things have in common. They are the proper act, the distinctive work, the unique function of living things.
* The drive for life in humans is stronger then other competing drives, including whatever conscience or moral norms dictate, since most people will do what is dishonorable or wrong to preserve their own lives, or the lives of their genetic kin. 
 * The drive for reproduction, the sex drive, is stronger than even our drive for eating or drinking or other forms of pleasure. Psychologists tell us that males think about sex every eight minutes, or so. Also people will have sex at almost any opportunity. The Olympic Village being an example. Also, people reproduce far beyond the rate that other considerations recommend. The species is rapidly over populating the planet at the expense of other ecosystems, other species, other lifeforms like the rain forest, and even the planets as a whole.
* On the contrary, Socrates tells the Athenians at his trial to cultivate virtue which is the health of the soul more than the adornment and pleasure of the body. And many other moral exemplars, Saints, and sages tell us that the final cause of humanity as a species are something more then our biological dictates.
* I answer that our end as the perfection of our nature. In so far as our nature includes but is not limited to our biology, our end includes but is not limited to our biology. Furthermore, occasionally the pursuit of our final cause demands that we ignore or reject or deny the dictates of our biology. As for instance, a parent who is down to her last loaf of bread will suffer hunger herself in order to feed her children. Or a celibate monk who will forgo the pleasures of sex, the biological interest in reproduction, and the joy of child rearing for the sake of the perfection of intellect and heart. 

* Plus, Saints just do not talk like that. They talk about serving God, or becoming enlightened, or beholding the truth, or spreading happiness to all. Notice that spreading happiness to all May or may not correspond to maximizing my own personal happiness.
* Talk about such final causes has seem more likely to be included in the definition of perfecting human nature according to its form is in ennobling. 
* By contrast talk about final causes such as survival and reproduction is morally enervating. People who think and talk like this display also pathological psychologies obsessed with what is merely animal and ignoring or denying or rejecting what is more than animal. 

The clearest and best definition of virtue I have ever heard is still the simplest. The first definition I heard it's still the clearest invest.

The virtue of X is a property of X that makes it F well, where F is its proper function, it's proper work, or achieving its final cause, attaining to its telos, actualizing the potential inherent to its form. A virtue of a knife is that property of a knife that makes it cut well. Knives are supposed to cut, that is what they are for, cutting and occasionally stabbing are its final causes, it's proper function. And so the virtues of knives is at least: being sharp, being durable enough and hard enough to cut through matter softer than itself, and depending on the knife a serrated edge or a sharp point. There are a variety of species of knife, who's functions display a variety of species of cutting and or stabbing. The purpose or final cause of a knife is also relative to the user of the knife. Since we are speaking about implements for humans, a virtue of the knife may include such necessary properties as having one and that is emphatically not sharp so that the user can hold that end without being cut.

Now if all this qualification is necessary for something so simple an artifact as a knife, it will take much more work to sketch even a plausible prima Facie Account of the final cause of simple natural objects, let alone complex organisms.  Doing that work is our task.

What does Aristotle say is the telos of, say, an oak tree? The answer must be discovered at least in part empirically. Some induction or abstraction helps us to identify the form behind the phenomena we observe. Oaktree's tend to become fully grown folks. At some point the maturation process slows and stops. What do fully grown oaks do? What is their proper work? They provide oxygen into the atmosphere. They provide housing for birds, bugs, and shade and housing for primates and humans. They preserve the soil. They grow and reproduce. What properties might qualify as the virtues of an oak?  Certainly needs sunshine water atmosphere and soil of a certain kind to thrive Qua Oaktree.  But these are not its virtues, these are necessary conditions for the rising of its virtues. Contributing factors we might call them. Sources of life. It's virtues would be strength of limb, deep roots, strong cellulose walls, a sufficiently wide trunk, etc.

What is the final cause of a human? What is our proper work? It is not a tautology to say that what we are supposed to do is to be men and women. For we can fail at that. Once we have human nature, we cannot fail to be human in some descriptive sense. But even though we have human nature, we can fail to be happy, to achieve humanity in a prescriptive cents.

We are supposed to thrive, flesh, be happy. We are supposed to be Saints. That means wise thinkers and heroically virtuous doers.


























#Chapter X Naturalizing Virtue 2 - John McDowell’s View from Somewhere, and Intersubjective Norms of Reason and Practical Reason

##Introduction

Richard Bernstein calls John McDowell’s naturalism a much needed “novel twist” on the stalemate between those who think naturalism will eventually make good on its promise to naturalize reason and those who are sick of waiting and ready to give up. 

He quotes Joseph Margolis and Mark Gottlieb as saying that: 

Naturalism in the current analytic sense may well be the dominant programmatic orientation of Anglo-American philosophy. It may be characterized as an informally linked family of doctrines and strategies broadly in accord with 'ancestral' themes of W. V. O. Quine's "Epistemology Naturalized." The original themes feature in Quine include: a preference for physicalism of one sort or another, a strong emphasis on the continuity of science and philosophy, particularly at the explanatory level, and the effective replacement of legitimative inquiries of a typically noncausal sort by causal inquiries centering on belief." (Berstein 58) 

The "specter of Kant keeps surfacing in thinkers like Putnam and Habermas who are convinced that reason cannot be naturalized" (Berstein 59). The "novel twist" comes from John McDowell. Berstein says that “at first glance, it seems that McDowell fits right into the tradition of Kantian anti-naturalism — a tradition that runs from Kant right up to Putnam and Habermas” since he thinks “reason can’t be naturalized” (Bernstein 62). But his arguments, Berstein thinks, against bald naturalism amount to some sophisticated question-begging via sleight of hand. Even so, when we look at particular “first order claims


##John McDowell

###Mind and World
The “oscillation” between two false and fearful alternatives is the backdrop against which McDowell’s unique beliefs about mind and world come to light. 


John McDowell shares with Thomas Nagel a radical lack of curiosity about the metaphysics — that is, the traditional metaphysics — of morality. As a type of Kantian, he doesn’t think such answers are possible to find and so such questions not much worth asking. 
Second nature is the key concept for John McDowell. Second nature is that realm of human intersubjectivity wherein we are sensitive to reasons (that is, reasons for thinking and reasons for acting). Bald nature is not sensitive to reasons. Supernature, hypothetically, would be but is not natural and so is spooky. 


##Rosalind Hursthouse

Rosalind Hursthouse has become, in recent years, the premier voice of virtue ethics. Dialoguing fluently not only with Aristotle but Plato and Kant, Hursthouse has synthesized much of John McDowell and Philippa Foot into her own original, articulate vision of a respectable modern virtue ethics. 

###Naturalism
Hursthouse’s account consists of a few interrelated and important theses: virtues benefit their possessor (Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics, Chapter 8). In the case of human virtue, the virtues are “those traits that human beings need to live well as human beings, to live a characteristically human life” (Hursthouse 192).  

But what is this characteristically human life? What is a human? 

In guiding action, virtue ethics appeals to the virtuous agent.

P.1. An action is right iff it is what a virtuous agent would characteristically (i.e. acting in character) do in the circumstances.
An objection is that P.1. suffers with respect to rival theories in failing to be action guiding or informative. But Hursthouse’s reply (which smacks of a tu quoque until we realize that ethical inquiry is hard for everyone) is that utilitarianism and deontology suffer in virtually the same respect. To make this clear, she rephrases the first premise. 
P.1. An action is right iff it is what an X agent would characteristically do in the circumstances.
To this, she adds: 
P.1a. An X agent is one who has and exercises certain character traits, namely the Xs.


  “The other first premises, taken strictly, are equally uninformative. We overlook this point because the utilitarian specifications of best consequences are so familiar, and all the deontologists we know cite familiar moral rules. But, for all that is said in the first premise of either, strange things might emerge in the second” (30). 

Hare would have it that 'good' was somehow functioning differently in ethical utterances than in phrases like 'the 2003 models have good enginges.' Hursthouse explains Foot's observation about attributive adjectives in this way: 
&gt;You can evaluate and choose things according to almost any criteria you like, you must select the noun or noun phrase you use to describe the thing you are calling good *advisedly*, for it determines the criteria of goodness that are appropriate. Hare can call a cactus a good one on the grounds that it is diseased and dying, and choose it for that reason, but what he must not do is describe it as a good *cactus*, for a cactus is a living thing. He can describe it as a good ‘decorative object for my windowsill’ or ‘present to give my detestable mother‐in‐law’, but not as a good cactus. And it was part and parcel of what used to be thought of as Foot's ‘naturalism’ in ethics that, following Anscombe in ‘Modern Moral Philosophy’, she denied that this grammatical feature of the word ‘good’ and its related terms suddenly underwent a mysterious change when we started doing ethics. What goes for ‘good cactus’, ‘good knife’, ‘good rider’, also goes for ‘good human being’ even when we use that phrase in ethics (195). 


### Hursthouse on Naturalism?
“Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism—broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being” (Hursthouse 193). But the question is whether “human nature” is purely descriptive set of properties, ranges, relations, etc., or includes normative content from the outset.  As Hursthouse summarizes the worry: “Ethical naturalism hopes to validate beliefs about which character traits are virtues by appeal to human nature, and this may seem a vain hope. For either we speak from the neutral point of view, using a scientific account of human nature—in which case we won't get very far—or we speak from within an acquired ethical outlook—in which case we will not validate our ethical beliefs, but merely re‐express them” (Hursthouse 193). 

Her path through the horns of this dilemma is the one blazed by John McDowell. Ethical inquiry is neither scientific in the sense that we must start with a neutral 3rd-personal point of view to attain “objectivity” nor is it foundational in that we must start “from within” the 1st-personal point of view, using a core proposition or set of propositions whose truth is certain and unproblematic and working out from there. Rater, within an ethical outlook we modify our ethical outlook. It is the ship of Neurath. 

“This chapter aims [give] some fairly specific details of how, in naturalistic terms, I might set about finding the rational credentials for my beliefs about which character traits are the virtues” (Hursthouse 194). 


How naturalistic is this virtue ethic? [I have argued that we cannot simply adopt the title for social reasons if we deny the majority view of what nature is.] How Aristotelian is neo-Aristotelianism? We ought not expect that every jot and tittle of Aristotle be preserved as sacred, but we ought to expect that some of Aristotle’s own core commitments overlap with a neo-Aristotelian’s core commitment. 

R. Scott Smith argues that MacIntyre’s virtue ethics assumes realism (Smith, Virtue Ethics and Moral Knowledge). Without the assumption, it loses coherence. 
An objection is that P.1. suffers with respect to rival theories in failing to be action guiding or informative. But Hursthouse’s reply (which smacks of a tu quoque until we realize that ethical inquiry is hard for everyone) is that utilitarianism and deontology suffer in virtually the same respect. To make this clear, she rephrases the first premise. 
P.1. An action is right iff it is what an X agent would characteristically do in the circumstances.
To this, she adds: 
P.1a. An X agent is one who has and exercises certain character traits, namely the Xs.

  “The other first premises, taken strictly, are equally uninformative. We overlook this point because the utilitarian specifications of best consequences are so familiar, and all the deontologists we know cite familiar moral rules. But, for all that is said in the first premise of either, strange things might emerge in the second” (30). 

“Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism—broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being” (Hursthouse 193). But the question is whether “human nature” is purely descriptive set of properties, ranges, relations, etc., or includes normative content from the outset.  As Hursthouse summarizes the worry: “Ethical naturalism hopes to validate beliefs about which character traits are virtues by appeal to human nature, and this may seem a vain hope. For either we speak from the neutral point of view, using a scientific account of human nature—in which case we won't get very far—or we speak from within an acquired ethical outlook—in which case we will not validate our ethical beliefs, but merely re‐express them” (Hursthouse 193). 
Her path through the horns of this dilemma is the one blazed by John McDowell. Ethical inquiry is neither scientific in the sense that we must start with a neutral 3rd-personal point of view to attain “objectivity” nor is it foundational in that we must start “from within” the 1st-personal point of view, using a core proposition or set of propositions whose truth is certain and unproblematic and working out from there. Rater, within an ethical outlook we modify our ethical outlook. It is the ship of Neurath. 

“This chapter aims [give] some fairly specific details of how, in naturalistic terms, I might set about finding the rational credentials for my beliefs about which character traits are the virtues” (Hursthouse 194). 


 

###Stubborn Rationalism in Thomas Nagel

Thomas Nagel is one of those frustrating thinkers who allude to and interact with many but cite or name only a few.  

One of our governing questions in this dialectic has been: how do we know good from bad, right from wrong, desirable from undesirable when we in fact know it? This question assumes quite plausibly that we know the good at least some times and in some ways.  What does it mean to be good or right or desirable and how did we come to knowledge that X was such?
Thomas Nagel’s view is that morality is objective, that moral values are really real, that moral knowledge is possible, that there are moral truths, etc. and etc. For Nagel, “objective” means that reducing all values to merely subjective (in various senses of the term) is impossible, both theoretically and practically. The alternative then, is some kind of objectivity. He says, “The problem of the place of value in the natural world... has to do specifically with the practical domain — the control and assessment of conduct.” When the dust settles on long and complicated abstract discussions of the foundations of value, we still have to do something with our lives. And we cannot psychologically nor logically assert consistently that our choices of what to do are based on no reason. 


There are two senses of “objective” that can be opposed to Nagel’s sense of “subjective.” The thinner sense is that we can’t help but treat it as objective, whether it is or not — this sense remains agnostic. The thicker sense is that we can’t help but treat some value as objective and the reason we psychologically or logically cannot do so is because it is really objective. This sense of objective is, by Nagel’s own argument, a hypothesis to explain a psychological or logical  impossibility, but it is a very good hypothesis. 


Nagel’s position here is that normative judgments are truth apt. He says, “Normative realism is the view that propositions about what gives us reasons for action can be true or false independently of how things appear to us, and that we can hope to discover the truth by transcending the appearances and subjecting them to critical assessment” (View from Nowhere 139). However, he is quick to distinguish this answer from various answers to Question 3 — what makes evaluative propositions true. He assures us, “it is not a form of Platonism. The claim is that there are reasons for action, that we have to discover them instead of deriving them from our pre-existing motives— and that in this way we can acquire new motives superior to the old” (139). So his answer to Question to is a staunch yes, but he wants to distinguish that affirmative from various ways of spelling out exactly how to explain truth aptitude. He says, “perhaps a richer metaphysic of morals could be devised, but I don’t know what it would be” (139). 


His stance here may seem simply stubborn. But it is not. He treats objective values — like the freedom of the sort relevant for moral accountability and self-responsibility — as a “defeasible presumption” (VFN 143). The burden of proof is on those who wish to argue that there are no objective values and no objectively true value judgments, or that putatively true value judgments like “we ought to treat others as equal to ourselves” are not even truth apt. Like the reality of some item of the external world, the reality of an objective value can be defeated in individual cases, as when a long-cherished value judgment is exposed as a mere prejudice or instance of groupthink. But when I learn that a mirage is not real or a prejudice is false, I rightly conclude that some appearances are deceiving and that some products of groupthink are false. I do not — and should not — jump to the conclusion that all is appearance or all is prejudice. Just because some X are Y does not entail that all X are Y. We can only totalize a local exposoure of non-objectivity into global subjectivism if we make that invalid inference or hasten to hypothesis that unlikely explanation. 

Now, the explanation is more likely on the assumption that “if values are real, they must be real objects of some other kind” (VFN 144). As the external world realist, so long as the moral realist can defend the mere possibility of objective value, the presumption of objective value remains the default position (VFN 143-144). He says, “If I have a severe headache, the headache seems to me to be not merely unpleasant, but a bad thing. Not only do I dislike it, but I think I have a reason to try to get rid of it. It is barely conceivable that this might be an illusion” (VFN 145). Such glaring truths of daily experience may be puzzling against a background of physicalism, but it is not thereby to be abandoned. 


Thomas Nagel may be considered radically uncurious about the metaphysical question. He is right, I think, to say that metaethical questions often confuse the normative questions — or rather that only by retaining focus on the primary normative questions can we keep perspective on metaethics. 





#Chapter x - Ethical Naturalism as Nihilism, of both reality and morals, as a cliff

Even though Kant was a nihilist about metaphysics, he was a realist about morality. 

##Terence Cuneo - The Normative Web

Terrence Cuneo’s fascinating book builds an argument for moral realism on the key premise that “if moral facts do not exist, then epistemic facts do not exist” (The Normative Web 90). This premise leads us, if we affirm the antecedent, to the “undesirable results” of having to affirm that epistemic facts do not exist. Once we affirm that epistemic facts do not exist, it follows that we do not believe anything, let alone that view, on the basis of epistemic facts. 

Moral facts are thought objectionable by some for their ‘queer’ features, such as (in the words of Lenman’s review of Cuneo): 
(a) the supervenience of moral facts on other, prosaically descriptive, facts
(b) the intrinsically motivating character of moral reasons
(c) the inescapable or categorical character of moral reasons
(d) the supposed mysterious nature of moral facts in failing to fit neatly into a naturalistic picture of the world
(e) the failure of moral facts to play a role in explaining other facts -- or a sufficiently rich range of such facts
(f) the great extent and apparent intractability of moral disagreement.

David Enoch agrees. 

“Why are people so suspicious of morality, robust-realistically understood? Sometimes the worries are metaphysical – moral properties, or truths, or facts, or values, or duties, or some such are said to be metaphysically queer, not to find a comfortable place in a naturalistic worldview, and so on. The merits of such worries are a matter for Chapter 6, but my point here is much more limited: if you think that things like the purported fact that we ought not to humiliate others is metaphysically queer, you should be equally metaphysically suspicious of things like the purported fact that two-boxing is the uniquely rational policy in Newcomb’s Problem. If you find it hard to metaphysically stomach things like the value of humanity (or the negative value of pain), you shouldn’t (prima facie, at least) find the value of excitement more appetizing. If the scientific worldview can’t find room for the wrongness of murder, it is hard to see how it can find room for the irrationality and (sometimes) irresponsibility involved in wishful thinking. The metaphysical worries about morality seem to just be instances of metaphysical worries about normativity more generally.

More or less relatedly, some suspicions about morality (robust-realistically understood) are epistemological in nature. If there are truths of the kind that the Platonist (say) envisages, how is it, it is sometimes asked, that we can have epistemic access to them? And if we can’t, should we conclude that on this view none of our moral beliefs are justified? And isn’t this a reductio of this kind of Platonism? Again, a discussion of the merits of this and related objections will be postponed, this time until Chapter 7. But for now the crucial thing to see is that the epistemological challenge – whatever exactly its details – seems to apply just as forcefully to other, non-moral normative truths and facts. So here too, the objection to Robust Metaethical Realism is just a particular instance of an objection to a similar view about the normative as a whole.” (89)

Cuneo’s “Interlude on Naturalism” interests me greatly (101-4). 

&gt;To this point I've traversed some fairly familiar territory in contemporary metaethics—four variants of Mackie's celebrated ‘argument from queerness’.20 I want now to interrupt the flow of the discussion for a moment to make a general comment about what is going on in these antirealist arguments and to draw out a further implication of my argument.
&gt;The four lines of argument we've considered hinge on the claim that, were moral facts to exist, they would be objectionably ‘mysterious’ and, hence, we have excellent reason to believe they do not exist. While it is fairly commonplace to hear philosophers say such things, it is not always so obvious what is meant when they do so. Imagine an outsider listening in on this discussion between moral realists and antirealists—one who, say, is used to wondering about whether there are four‐dimensional space‐time worms, (p.102) closed space‐times, event‐horizons, or universals. She might find herself deeply puzzled by the discussion thus far. What, after all, renders moral facts more objectionably mysterious than these other kinds of putative entities? And why should this oddness count against the existence of moral facts?
&gt;I take the answer to be that the antirealist thinks that moral facts are mysterious in two ways. They are mysterious, first, in the sense of being anomalous; moral facts don't fit into our best picture of what the world is like. Moral facts are mysterious, second, in the sense that they are impenetrable. We have no illuminating account of their nature or behavior. Of these two senses of mystery, I judge that it is the first that is doing the most work in the antirealist's arguments.21 So, let's focus on it for a moment.
&gt;That nothing is brutely anomalous I take to be a truism. Entities are always anomalous relative to some set of assumptions or background picture of what the world is like. And it is no secret that the background picture against which moral facts are supposed to be anomalous in the arguments we've considered thus far is a naturalist picture of the world.22 Almost without fail, antirealists object to moral facts because they appear to fit so poorly into the world picture science is supposed to give us. Simon Blackburn puts the point particularly vividly in his essay ‘How to Be an Ethical Anti‐Realist’, when he writes that moral antirealism is ‘demanded’ by a naturalistic worldview and claims that, according to moral antirealists, ‘moral properties . . . are not in this world at all, and it is only because of this that naturalism remains true’.23 If Blackburn is right, a necessary condition of naturalism's being true is moral realism's being false. Now my own conviction is that this is not the sort of thing a naturalist ought to say. According to a popular and broadly Quinean understanding of naturalism, the naturalist's creed is that we ought to follow science wherever it goes. (p.103) Arguably, however, accepting this creed is incompatible with claiming that naturalism implies that moral realism is false, for we cannot rule out a priori that science may reveal that there are moral facts and, hence, that moral realism is compatible with naturalism.24
&gt;Be that as it may, what I would like to point out is that, if naturalism implies that there are no moral facts and if this claim implies that there are no epistemic facts, then naturalism gives us strong reason to believe that there are no epistemic facts. If, however, my overarching argument is correct and there are epistemic facts, then we have good reason to believe that naturalism—at least of the kind that is driving the arguments we've considered—is false. The apparent price of tying naturalism so closely to moral antirealism is, I suggest, to increase the vulnerability of the naturalist project.

In a footnote, Cuneo criticises our contemporary use of the term 'naturalism', deprecating it as a "philosopher's weasel-word" that "admits of a great variety of incompatible meanings" [@cuneo footnote 22.] [^9]

[^9]: Cuneo says: "(22) Blackburn (1993), Ch. 9 and (1998), Ch. 3, Gibbard (1990), Part II, Horgan and Timmons (1990/91), Mackie (1977), Ch. 1, and Timmons (1999), Ch. 1, are explicit about this. In my estimation, the term ‘naturalism’ is a philosopher's weasel‐word, which admits of a great variety of incompatible meanings. In some senses of the term, I believe that moral and epistemic realism are compatible with naturalism. My use of the term borrows from Rea (2002), Ch. 3.

Cuneo’s core argument he phrases like this:

* (1) If moral facts do not exist, then epistemic facts do not exist.

* (2) Epistemic facts exist.

* (3) So, moral facts exist.

* (4) If moral facts exist, then moral realism is true.

* (5) So, moral realism is true. 

The first premise he calls the ‘parity premise.’ The argument in its favor rests on four “salient respects in which putative moral and epistemic facts are similar” (Cuneo 225).  The second stage of the argument for the first premise shows that all of the “standard objections” to the “objectionable features” of moral facts, should they exist, would also establish that epistemic facts display the same objectionable features. 

Cuneo constructs “epistemic analogues” of three “prominent forms of antirealism” in Chapters 4-7. But each of these strategies for avoiding epistemic realism are false. The first form of antirealism is nihilism of the sort that claims there aren’t any epistemic facts and so there aren’t any epistemic reasons to believe anything. It follows that there is no epistemic reason to believe anti-realism. Epistemic nihilism can be discarded by all of us who are “minimally rational.” 

The second strategy is “epistemic expressivism.” This strategy is very sophisticated. However, Cuneo pushes the view into a disjunctive critique where expressivism either captures much of our ordinary epistemic discourse but entails that all such discourse systematically misapplies epistemic concepts or doesn’t capture our epistemic dicourse at all since it entails that all such discourse does not “involved the application of epistemic concepts at all” (226). The upshot is that epistemic expressivism collapses into a skepticism not far different from nihilism. 

There is one other form of antirealism I do not summarize here. 

Even so, Cuneo has some clean up work to do. He discusses three other objections to his core argument. 

“The more expeditious manner of proceeding, which I shall adopt, is to concede that the standard objections to epistemic realism considered in Chapter 3 have some evidential force. But, I suggest that, even if we concede that at least a subset of these arguments creates problems for epistemic realism, then at best what these arguments establish is that the epistemic realist must countenance some metaphysical mysteries. If we grant, for example, that the standard objections are right to assume that supervenience relations are brute determination relations not amenable to explication, or that we have no informative account about how we apprehend epistemic facts of certain kinds, or that epistemic facts fail to play a wide explanatory role, then it follows that epistemic realism implies the existence of phenomena that are impenetrable—at least to agents with a cognitiveconstitution in an environment such as ours. (If the argument of the last chapter is correct, epistemic reductionism is really no different from realism in this respect; it is no less mysterious in these respects than is realism.) I submit that countenancing mysteries of these types, while perhaps not very attractive in some respects, is a significantly better theoretical option than embracing wholesale epistemological skepticism. Accepting mysteries of these types is, for example, not as such irrational; indeed, arguably, were there mysteries of this sort, they would be among many other mysteries that philosophers must accept (issues regarding the nature of intentionality, qualia, free choice, numbers, and so forth, spring to mind.) Embracing radical skepticism, by contrast, is irrational, for one cannot be a minimally rational agent and accept that there is no reason to believe anything. And on the plausible assumption that, if given a choice between accepting two incompatible positions, the acceptance of only one of which is compatible with being minimally rational, then we should accept that position” (Cuneo 241-2).

#Chapter X - Scientific Ethics Part 1 - Pursuing without Grasping, The Transcendence and Unity of Ethical and Epistemic Norms

*“Every soul pursues the good and does whatever it does for its sake. It divines that the good is something but is perplexed and cannot adequately grasp what it is.” Plato, Republic 505e-506a.*
 
##Introduction
	Most philosophers believe that at least some of our ethical beliefs are really true and that some things are really good. But if the good is real, is it natural or nonnatural? Richard Boyd argues that our term ‘goodness’ refers to a set of natural “immanent” mutually reinforcing properties that favor human well-being. Robert Adams argues that the good is identical to a supernatural, transcendent God. Good things are such just insofar as they resemble God. Which metaethical position makes the best sense of our (sometimes correct, sometimes incorrect) application of ethical terms in everyday discourse and the historic discipline of systematic ethics? 

	These questions embroil us in metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, and semantic considerations. Of course, a full treatment of them here is not possible. As Boyd points out, metaphysical commitments to or against the existence of a god will sway one’s ethical commitments. Rather, in this paper, I examine a few facets of the larger dialectic, focusing on written conversation between Boyd and Adams spanning one book and three articles. I offer my own contribution to their conversation. My conclusion is that — even absent independent arguments from philosophy of religion— our most stable and cogent ethical thinking, and our most incorrigible ethical principles, sit better in a framework where the good is understood to be transcendent, and unitary. Adams has the upper hand, I think, for three reasons: (1) Adams’ account most accurately explains the intuitive truth that we ought to be open to revising many ethical beliefs but that there are some that we (already) know certainly enough that we ought not be open to revising them. (2) Boyd’s homeostatic property cluster idea, though impressive and thorough, is not yet ambitious enough to even aspire to explain the numerous (and apparently irreducible) various kinds of goodness (and beauty, and excellence, etc.) but restricts itself to human welfare, which is only part of an adequate metathics. And (3) epistemic norms are more closely related to ethical norms than Boyd would like to admit.
 
&gt;Stephen Darwall (2006: 25) notes that, nevertheless, “there do seem to be affinities between metaethical and roughly corresponding ethical theories,” for example, metaethical naturalists have almost universally tended to be Utilitarians at the first-order level, though not vice versa. Notable exceptions to this tendency—that is, metaethical naturalists who are also first-order deontologists—include Alan Gewirth (1977) and Michael Boylan (1999; 2004). For critical responses to these positions, see Beyleveld (1992), Steigleder (1999), Spence (2006), and Gordon (2009). (Kevin DeLapp, "Metaethics")[@delapp]

&gt;Matthew Kramer (2009: 2) has argued that metaethical realism (see section four below) is itself actually a first-order moral view as well, noting that “most of the reasons for insisting on the objectivity of ethics are ethical reasons.” (For a similar view about the first-order “need” to believe in the second-order thesis that moral values are “objective,” see also Ronald Dworkin 1996.) Torbjörn Tännsjö (1990), by contrast, argues that, although metaethics is irrelevant to normative theorizing, it may still be significant in other psychological or pragmatic way, for example, by constraining other beliefs. Nicholas Sturgeon (1986) has claimed that the first-order belief in moral fallibility must be grounded in some second-order metaethical view. And David Wiggins (1976) has suggested that metaethical questions about the ultimate foundation and justification of basic moral beliefs may have deep existential implications for how humans view the question of the meaning of life. [@delapp]

 
##Richard Boyd I:  Homeostatic Property Clusters
First, a few words on Richard Boyd’s metaethical project are in order. Boyd’s “How to Be a Moral Realist” (1998) essay has been influential in establishing the viability of one kind of ethical naturalism. Boyd is not a non-cognitivist or “otherwise deflationary” naturalist. He is interested (along with Sturgeon, Brink, Miller, et. al.,) in justifying moral realism within the bounds of a strict, scientific naturalism. Their project has at least two claims:  ethics is a science (or should be!); ethical inquiry can and should be continuous with empirical scientific inquiries. That is the epistemological claim.  And ethics is consequentialist; Boyd and others think ethical inquiry will involve giving some kind of naturalistic account of our collective human welfare and of those natural properties that contribute thereto. That is the normative ethical claim. 

Most of Boyd’s writings have focused on the schema rather than the content of a naturalistic moral realism, offering a general framework rather than detailed and comprehensive moral realist accounts, including a list of goods. Even so, in sketching out the schema, he has offered an account of “important human goods”, both physical and psychological, like food and friendship. Exactly what natural entities and properties count as human goods will become important below. 

### Natural Kinds
For Boyd, goods are importantly like natural kinds. Normal natural kinds, like ‘water’ and ‘metal’ indispensably feature in our inductive and abductive reasoning.[^2] For example, suppose that I begin typing on a friend’s laptop on a cold day, but I notice the keys are surprisingly cold to the touch. My friend points out that his keyboard keys are not plastic but metal. “Metal” of course, is not one single element on the periodic table, and so has no one single essence, understood as a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for instantiation. So what is such a natural kind? Certain properties tend to cluster together (conductivity, malleability, etc.), where the presence of each of which makes likely the presence of the others. This understanding of natural kinds is flexible enough to show why ‘metal’ can feature in a good explanation (of why the keyboard is cold) and also why exceptional or unusual metals —- ones that lack some typical properties — still count as members of the natural kind.

Biological natural kinds follow the same pattern. Tigers are real, and ‘tiger’ the natural kind is real. We do not invent, but discover, the nature of tigers.  Yet ‘Tiger’ is not one property-instantiation of a simple universal, but denotes a cluster of properties that tend to make likely others in that cluster.

Goodness, Boyd suggests, is just such a natural kind and homeostatic property cluster. Something similar to our application of terms like ‘metal’ and ‘tiger’ is going on in our application of value terms and the semantic relation to real — but natural —  value-properties. Our value talk  is answerable to something in the mind-independent real world: such property clusters. Property clusters like goodness, however, have no one analytic definition — at base, they are not unities but pluralities. Keeping goodness as a natural kind without supplying an analytic definition helpfully avoids the definist fallacy.[^3] Beyond this schema, Boyd thinks that the properties that make up the goodness cluster tend to come together in certain political and social contexts (like democratic, respectful, egalitarian, courteous, educated societies) where we pursue and somewhat successfully achieve human welfare.[^4] So virtues, right actions, laws or policies and so on earn the predicate “good” when they “tend to foster the realization of these goods” (Boyd 1988, 203). As Adams says (in summarizing Boyd) “The good is more fundamental than the right in his view, and well-being or what is good for people is more fundamental than moral goodness” (Adams 2003, 60).

### Transgenerational Scientific Disciplines

The correct account of ethical terms as natural kind terms will also include considerations of the inquiry as a whole, the disciplinary matrix. The disciplinary matrix is an interweaving set of terms and projects shared by practitioners and researchers within a discipline. The terms ‘metal,’ ‘tiger ’and‘ goodness’ are currency in chemistry, biology, and ethics respectively. Our account of them should make sense of how experts in that discipline intelligibly converse, form predictions, and achieve successes in that field. It should make sense of how that field or discipline exists across generations.

Boyd’s ambitious project, we can see, is both naturalist and realist. He invokes concepts like natural kinds and disciplinary matrices from his metaphysics and epistemology of scientific realism to build a similar explanation of moral natural kinds and moral inquiry. Unlike “deflationary” naturalists like Mackie, Boyd does not take the (shorter, but more problematic) path of denying that goodness is a real thing.
 
##Robert Adams I: Being For the Infinite Good
Before summarizing the debate between Boyd and Adams, we should say a few words about Robert Adams’ project. At an opposite metaethical extreme from Boyd, Adams represents supernaturalism. Adams’ fascinating Finite and Infinite Goods: A Framework for Ethics is a comprehensive case for, and explanation of, an ethical framework organized around an infinite good (God) who grounds a great variety of finite goods. 

Importantly, as we shall see below, Adams places a high premium on being for the Good. This general orientation towards the good with love and allegiance is critical for Adams and for my comments about Boyd’s critiques. Why is it so critical for Adams? One reason is that one cannot love all finite goods, yet he sees (and I think rightly) that this inability is not a fault. One can love the infinite good — be devoted to it — without loving an unlimited set of finite goods. In fact, one can love the infinite good in and through loving a limited set of finite goods.

A second reason being for is so important for Adams’ account is that we can and ought to love many different kinds of goods: people of various kinds, beauties of art and nature, abstract truths of mathematics and philosophy, and so on. Being for the good (in general) makes sense of our generic aspirations for excellence of many kinds,  and our admiration for those who are able to successful love and exemplify such a variety of excellences, both personal and impersonal. Even when our aspirations are unsuccessful, even in the case of ill consequences of our pursuit of excellence, there is something praiseworthy about the fundamental orientation toward the good.
 
###Adams II: The “Critical Stance” Tells against Naturalism
Adams second chapter of Finite and Infinite Goods takes aim at naturalism. Naturalisms, of which there are many, are united in seeing the good as immanent to either the physical, natural world or at least to human nature — our thoughts, motivations, physiology, psychology, and so on. The transcendence Adams argues for includes (at least) three points: The Good itself surpasses every (finite) good thing. Since the Good is limitless, it explains the (in principle unlimited) potential for new instances and kinds of human and non-human goodness and beauty. Finally, and most importantly for our purposes, the Good being limitless explains why we ought to maintain a critical stance Adams argues is indispensable to our ethical thinking. The “critical stance” is the key theme I want to trace in this paper.

In Chapter 2, section 4, Adams takes aim at (especially) Richard Boyd’s naturalism. The main critique is that (Boyd’s sort) of naturalism allegedly excludes a “critical stance” that is necessary for any ethical theory. Just what is the “critical stance”? Adams’ own summary is this: “For any natural, empirically identifiable property or type of action that we or others may regard as good or bad, right or wrong, we are committed to leave it always open in principle to raise evaluative or normative questions by asking whether that property or action‐type is really good or right, or to issue an evaluative or normative challenge by denying that it is really good or right” (Adams 2002, 78).  Our ethical thinking and practical judgments must be “open” when we judge finite goods to be good. The reason is not (pace G. E. Moore) that we can simply assume the good to be indefinable and then dismiss attempted definitions. Rather, because there is a metaphysical gap between the transcendent, infinite good and any finite thing, our certainty that there is a good is always counterpoised with our uncertainty that this is as good as it seems to us at present. This critical stance is, according to Adams, definitionally a part of our value talk.  He says, “I think the critical stance is part of the general intentional framework in which we use evaluative and normative terms, at least where morality and excellence are concerned, and thus affects the semantically indicated role of such terms.” (Adams 2002, 78) To fail to account for it would be a grave error.

What is wrong with Boyd’s view, according to Adams? Boyd thinks that empirical knowledge — albeit hypothetical, future knowledge — could be enough to settle a question of value. Adams thinks that the “settling” of the question would always and in principle be hasty. Of course, Boyd can accommodate the proper open, critical stance right now, but cannot guarantee that it is the right stance to take in some hypothetical future when our empirical data is perfectly full and adequate.

One final corollary of Adams’ critical stance thesis that Boyd also discusses is that some of our moral beliefs are already (prior to idealized empirical justification) more epistemically secure than some well-grounded scientific theories. Putting the matter a little more sharply, Adams says, “...it would surely be crazier to give up the belief that it would be wicked to torture children than to say that there must be something wrong with quantum mechanics” (Adams 76). Boyd’s naturalist realism seems to entail that even beliefs like the (almost certain) proposition ‘it is wicked to torture children’ are as open to revision as the latest beliefs about sub-atomic particles. Despite Boyd’s attempt to secure such beliefs under the umbrella of ‘quasi-analycity, that openness, Adams thinks, is far too open.

Somewhat more succinctly and less clearly than Adams puts it, we might say that if a  metaethical theory is true, it must include (in the sense of either justifying or at least not contradicting) a critical stance toward ethical judgments and ethical questions. Boyd’s ethical theory — his sort of consequentialist naturalism — does not include such a critical stance. So Boyd’s ethical theory is false.
 
##Boyd II: Partial Denotation &amp; Epistemic Normativity
Boyd’s response to Adams is, largely, to consent that the “critical stance” is critically important (Boyd 2003, 508). So he must show how his naturalism can accommodate it. Where necessary, where naturalism cannot accommodate the “criticalness,” Boyd must show how it is not important. Of course, Boyd clarifies, not every stance that qualifies as ‘critical’ is desirable. Boyd sketches the “critical-stance-on-the-cheap”, in which any conclusion “not analytically entailed by empirical evidence” is falls short of deductive certainty (2003, 524). Empirical evidence just doesn’t underwrite conclusions that certainly.

Of the more substantive openness or criticalness, Boyd thinks it “epistemically correct” to take “something like the critical stance [Adams] articulates” (2003, 513). We are to be open to new insight, new conversation, new challenges to our ethical conclusions because (a) they depend on empirical observations and empirically-based arguments, and (b) such observations and arguments are “complex” and it is difficult to say when they are “definitive” (2003, 513). Consenting to this much, Boyd thinks it is false that the critical stance is “part of our current conception of ethical reasoning” (2003, 514). So how much and what kind of “openness” to reevaluation does Boyd endorse?

Boyd’s overall project is to present epistemic, metaphysical, and semantic considerations that defend or increase the plausibility of naturalist moral realism. It would be impossible to summarize his lengthy article entirely. In this section, I shall attempt to organize Boyd’s instructive responses under two headings: Partial denotation of ethical terms and epistemic normativity. I shall then summarize more briefly Adams’ responses to Boyd before giving my own.
 
###Partial Denotation, Externalism, and Quasi-Analycity
The first consideration Boyd discusses throughout is “partial denotation.” This semantic notion does metaphysical and ethical work. Denotation occurs when language users mean to denote k with term t. Partial denotation is the notion that language users mean to and successfully do denote k1 with term t, but at the same time (erroneously and unintentionally) also denote another kind (k2).  For example, the term ‘species’ partially denotes (and properly so) the concept of a family of, say, animals, or trees, or systems; it also (improperly) implies that species is the same in animal species and a floral species, qua species. Terms partially denote when they bear “a strong reference-like connection” to a kind but the reference-connection is not clean or complete. One way to approach this notion is to think about a natural kind term that has referred to the same natural kind entity for centuries.  How did language users successfully use the term ‘water’ (or ‘lead’) denote H2O (or atomic number 82) before we had the chemical knowledge that water is (atomically) H20 or the chemical makeup of Pb? Boyd’s answer is partial denotation.

This is where “partial denotation” comes in to help keep a place for the critical stance. Partial denotation allows us to give credit to early language users and explain their successful application of terms to the relevant properties while also denying them full knowledge of the referents of those terms, and endorsing our own more advanced knowledge. As Adams phrases it, “If ‘good’ does... indeed signify a real property, there must be a tendency for members of the relevant community of discourse to be approximately right in (much of) what they say about the good, though this tendency may, and almost certainly does, fall hugely short of infallibility” (Adams 2003, 128). Notice that both philosophers are obliged to account for our successes and failures as ethical thinkers, but their emphases are different. Adams can explain why we already grasp the good enough to be for it, but must tell a story about how can err; Boyd can easily explain how we err, but must tell a longer story to explain how we often get the reference of moral terms right.

Another way partial denotation helps Boyd is to develop a plausible externalism. Internalism is the conception that something being good is sufficient reason for preferring it. The good is the admirable, desirable, worthy, etc. by definition. (Needless to say, it may or may not be admired, desired, or ascribed worth — but it is so.) Boyd admits that “it is hard to defend internalism and naturalism simultaneously” (2003, 532). As I understand it, Boyd’s solution is to offer that some terms that definitionally include ‘worthiness of pursuit’ do indeed partially denote things or actions that are worthy of pursuit, but not completely.

How exactly partial denotation works in each case is much less clear. He says that “if we are faced with evidence which seems to establish that the term ‘good’ refers to some natural phenomenon, P, the moral implausibility of P’s being the good can in principle undermine or override such evidence. Moral inquiry has a certain level of autonomy with respect to other areas of inquiry. If one thinks of this autonomy as absolute, then the appeal to partial denotation might be one way to save some sort of moral realism without adopting Adams’ solution” (2003, 531). Yet Boyd denies that moral inquiry is (completely) autonomous. He sees ethical reasoning as “continuous” with other natural and social sciences, both methodologically and ontologically. Each branch of science has a certain level of autonomy, but none complete. So deliverances from its autonomous domain cannot coherently serve as principles that trump the empirical discoveries of any other domain.

As a particular example, Boyd notes that many approbative terms like “just,” “fair” and so on tend to be used in contexts where the referents are convenient to the ruling class. The morally implausible conclusion that the ‘good’ both refers to ‘the convenience of the ruling class’ and that such convenience is in fact good is urged upon us by examining the “reference-like relations” between the use of the term historically and the oftentimes referent. We can be mistaken because the convenience the ruling class is not quite what goodness really is. “We (let’s hope rightly) take ourselves to be informed moral practitioners, and we rely-with serious qualifications-on our own moral judgments as evidential with respect both to the extension of “good,” and the aims of moral practice.” (2003, 545)

To take another particular case of moral implausibility, Boyd discusses the proposition that torturing children is wicked. Boyd (borrowing from Putnam) defines some propositions as ‘quasi-analytic’ — meaning that “even when we know that their justification is a posteriori rather than a priori, we find it extremely difficult to envision circumstances under which they would be disconfirmed” due their “conceptual and methodological centrality.” Changing them requires not simple empirical observations but “pretty serious conceptual and theoretical ‘revolutions’.” He offers two examples of quasi-analytic statements: torturing children is wicked and “the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics” (which he does not further specify).  To empirically confirm that torturing children is wicked, the term ‘wickedness’ picks out a natural property or family of properties “related to human goods and harms” etc., and that our judgments “track this family of properties” (2003, 525). Even though the proposition is ‘quasi-analytic’, the naturalist must remain open in principle to the possibility that empirical investigation could reveal the proposition to be false (in some cases, at some times, etc.). In this way, Boyd hopes to retain room for a kind of critical stance.

 
###Epistemic (Morally-Neutral) Norms
A second key component of Boyd’s case is the primacy of epistemic norms. Can the study itself of ethical terms and properties be value neutral? Boyd imagines an intelligent, amoral, non-human linguist who wants to study the semantics of human languages, but who does not itself have any moral commitments (533). Boyd admits that his scientific realism (the analog to which he is trying to compare or with which he is trying to equate moral realism) is not value neutral; but he says it is moral-value neutral. The only norms (or “values” if you like) in force are epistemic norms governing, presumably those governing valid inferences, likely hypotheses, and so on. For instance, Boyd says that “in deciding what the referent is of a natural kind term, we are seeking to identify... the one which best fits the explanatory role associated with natural kind terms” (2003, 535, author’s emphasis). The notion of a “best fit” is, of course, normative — but epistemically so only. The only normative judgments “involved in determining that the nature of water is H2O ... are purely epistemic judgments about the merits of competing explanations...” (Boyd 2003, 536). Also, strangely, Boyd thinks these norms are hypothetical. He gives a rough example in imperative form: “Classify this way if you want to discover true generalizations about how chemical reactions work” (2003, 536).

Boyd extends his account of these epistemic hypothetical norms that govern practitioners in various disciplines in order to show how an amoral extraterrestrial still might be able to identify the reference of the moral terms of “moral practitioners” over time, accounting for old errors and new improvements (544). He hopes that these reflections show that one need only endorse epistemic norms to “explore the nature of the (moral) good” (2003, 545). In these ways, Boyd tries to bolster his naturalistic account and make room for (one kind of) critical stance.

One final question demands some comment. For Boyd, some of these ethical questions are metaphysically neutral. Ultimately, he believes the kind of openness that is epistemically or morally required depends in some part on one’s prior metaphysical views. Boyd thinks “that in fact neither naturalistic moral realism nor theistic moral realism has any difficulty in accounting for this sort of critical stance” (2003, 526). 

Rather, our approach to the question depends on each philosopher's prior metaphysical reasoning in general, (largely) independent of the conversation about the metaphysics of morals in particular. 

For instance, Adams sees our uncertainty about particular ethical judgments (that X is good, admirable, etc.) as rooted in God’s infinite nature. The unbounded nature of the good makes the a priori delimiting of goods impossible. That account both Boyd and Adam agree *could* be the right one, that it has some plausibility, that it is at least the right kind of account. 

On the other hand, Boyd can build something just as plausible: human nature is such that “uncertainty of knowledge of complex psychological, social, political, and economic factors” make a priori delimiting likewise impossible. “It is a matter of how we, as knowing subjects, are situated in a complex web of physical, psychological, and social causes” (2003, 529). 

But these metaphysical questions Boyd punts to another discussion. He says, “I believe, we should do the relevant metaphysics. If you have (largely) independent reasons to accept theism... then you have reason to accept the deeper metaphysical explanation and justification of for moral doubt” (2003, 530). While keeping two difficult inquiries separate is important for clarity, there is a danger to this strategy, as I shall comment below.

 
###Adams III: On Epistemic Norms

Adams’ paper is a warmly approving and thorough response to Boyd’s “Finite Goods.” They agree on many points. Where they disagree, again, is on the question of a critical stance, on the moral neutrality of epistemic norms, and on the internalism (of identification of the good and motivation).

What is his particular response to Boyd’s brand of critical stance? Adams says, “We do not endorse the same kind of openness.” (2003, 129) Boyd “seems to envisage ... refusing any longer to be committed to being for the good, while still believing that there is a real property... actually signified by ‘good.’” (2003, 130). By contrast, Adams “assumes that [goodness] gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good” (2003, 130). This is a telling critique, and I shall give my best explanation of the difference below.

Adams also differs from Boyd’s putatively ‘value-free’ epistemic norms. Boyd insists that the only normativity operative in identifying natural properties to which moral terms refer is epistemic normativity. Adams argues that “properly-attuned Eros” is response to excellence in a way that allows us to fix the reference of moral terms. Adams admits that Boyd might be able to “domesticate” such a notion into naturalistic account, but the attempt would be dubious. He would have to aver that “causal relationships [are] ultimately decisive for the nature of proper attunement of Eros” (Adams 2003, 130).  Adam’s response is to strongly recommend internalism. Adams affirms existence internalism when he says he “assume[s] that [goodness] is a property that gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good.” (Adams 2003, 130).

Boyd and Adam seem to disagree about what kinds of ethical propositions are up for grabs. Adams summarizes the problem in this way: “It is a serious problem, discussed in more than one place in Finite and Infinite Goods, how to hold firm moral convictions, on points on which one ought to have them, without failing idolatrously to acknowledge the distinction in principle between one's own convictions about the good, even on the most obvious points, and the good itself.” (Adams 2002, 128) As I see it, the dual propositions that we both know the good (irrevocably) and don’t sufficiently know the good (and so must always remain open) are in tension, but both true. The tension demands “a measure of trust, mingled no doubt with caution or distrust, in the stirrings of our own Eros” (131). We can be mistaken about the good and incorrectly apply the term, but we cannot be deeply and pervasively mistaken. The good must be something to which we have “epistemic access” and “epistemic access in the right way, partly through our Eros and other affective volitional responses” (Adams 2002, 131).

For Boyd, the attempt to settle the reference of value terms might need the kind of objective, third-person perspective of an intelligent extraterrestrial. But this leads to strange conclusions. What would an external observer guess is the reference of the term good? Quite often “the convenience for the ruling class”, something Boyd does not admire but that does satisfy or seems to satisfy the reference of the term. Boyd tries to keep ironic distance from endorsing this denotation by admitting that it might be (and is probably) only a partial denotation. For Adams even this admission is too near to a horrible falsehood. He says he would rather give up moral realism entirely than endorse the proposition that ‘the good’ means ‘the convenience of the ruling class.’

 
##Responses
Some of my responses I have already hinted at above. In this section I try to spell out with a little more detail some key points in this debate.  I organize my comments under a few three headings: openness, “third personal” morality, virtue epistemology.
 
###Openness
I began this inquiry with a quotation from Plato because it captures a tension that we shall see is crucial for understanding the debate between Adams and Boyd. For Plato, two seeming paradoxes are thematic, and recur (I think) throughout these writings. The first is that the good is mysterious even to specialists (“dialecticians”) and yet plain to everyone. We ‘divine’ it, but do not know it. The second is that the good is simple and unitary but underlies and causes a bewildering plurality of kinds of goods.

The first paradox is very close to the internalism/externalism debate, and heart of the Boyd/Adams conversation.  For Plato, the belief that P is good moves an agent to act — or rather, the fact that agents pursue P is due to their generic, overriding pursuit of the good. Good things intrinsically motivate pursuit, and our judgments about what is good or bad intrinsically motivates us, at least somewhat. Yet we can still err in judging the wrong thing to be good or in not pursuing the good well enough. There is a balance that Plato’s insight maintains: To emphasize too much our knowledge of the good is to risk undue rigidity and moral hubris. To emphasize too much our ignorance of the good is to risk undue flexibility and moral cowardice. Even today, any ethical theorist has to explain both how we are correct when we think about, talk about, and pursue various goods (beauty, excellence, justice) and how we are incorrect when we err. That we err often is, I hope, obvious. For we do misjudge the good, pursue the bad, whether or not we do so intentionally. That we are not therefore completely or utterly ignorant of the good seems to me equally obvious.

In my reading, one (unstated) reason that being for the good is so central to Adams’ framework is the truth in Plato’s statement above: We “divine that the good is something” (we have knowledge) but are “perplexed and cannot adequately grasp what it is.” Plato (and Socrates) see a truth that seems to me critical: we both know and do not know the good. To deny that we know it through “divination”, intuition, or some such less-than-adequate faculty is to risk betraying the good, to risk not being for the good.

Keeping these dual propositions in mind is the key to my own interpretation of Adam’s critical stance. We must hold two true propositions in view at all times. First, that we know the good, somehow and someway. Adams does not call this knowing an incorrigible intuition, but he does seem to rely on it. But secondly, and just as importantly, we do not know the good sufficiently; we don’t know it well enough to avoid error. Both propositions, and the tension between them, are essential to clear ethical outlook. To lose one would be like closing one eye.

How do these reflections relate to the so-called critical stance? It seems to the choice of the words ‘critical’ and ‘open’ are unfortunate. For, one can be “open” with regard to first principles or open with regard to conclusions derived therefrom. For example, one should be open to the possibility that one’s deductive reasoning, even when the argument seems watertight,  is erroneous in some unforeseen way; one should most emphatically not be open to the possibility that, say, the law of non-contradiction is false. Are there any principles of ethical thinking or practical reasoning that are as irreproachable and incorrigible as the law of non-contradiction is in speculative or theoretical thinking? I think Aquinas’ estimation that the proposition good is to be done and evil avoided qualify as propositions just about as fundamental and obvious as any, within an ethical context or outside (Summa Theologiae, 1-2, Q. 94, Art 2). That we know the good well enough for the proposition ‘the good is to be done’ to be intelligible seems to me a fundamental truth that Plato and many others have clung to.

Even so, as ethical inquiries (those with long histories and those active today) become more detailed, complicated, and practical, the conviction that option A or B is good becomes more difficult to justify with anything like certainty. So here remaining open and critical is the proper epistemic stance.

Boyd, I take it, would say that our success in pursuing the (real) good by name is due to a partial denotation, and the our failures in pursuing it are due to the fact that the denotation is only partial. But Adams has a stronger explanation for our confident that the good is to be pursued antecedently to any but the vaguest notion of what particular properties are conducive to human welfare. We know that excellence is desirable before we know very clearly or very thoroughly what human excellence consists of. Adams seems right that we can even recognize new and unprecedented forms of excellence when they appear to us, because we have first cognized the good.

 
###Third Personal Morality
Now for the second paradox. The Republic quotation highlights that the good is unitary yet causes all kinds of goodness. It is maximally single yet its effects are maximally plural — there are moral goods (virtues, etc.) but also aesthetic goods and many others. The good, therefore, explains all goodness. Like other Platonic forms, the good is the ‘cause’ of all good things insofar as they are good. Equality itself is the cause of equal things being equal. Both explain all instantiations of the given property in various substances. But the range of instantiations for goodness seems wider than that of equality. One can eat good food, have a good social standing, enjoy good health, create and obey good laws, contemplate good theories. Adams appropriates this framework to explain the commonsensical notion that there are not just many excellent things but many vastly different kinds of excellence. He says, “The things that I take to be excellent —  great books, beautiful music, heroic deeds, the dynamic complexity of a living body or an ecosystem — are very diverse, and so are the ways in which they are excellent. I take beauty, moral virtue, and the aptness of a response or interpretation all to be types of excellence” (Adams 2003, 119). Since God is the good, and finite goods are good by resemblance, Adams can account for the dappled and diverse range of incommensurable kinds of goodness.

For the ethical naturalist, a long and difficult account is required to unify all of the things to which we predicate a set of somewhat unified value predicates. If the good is a natural property cluster, Boyd may be quite some distance toward giving an account of just what property clusters are good for us, but he is quite a distance away from giving an account of systems (say, the excellence of an ecosystem) in which humans do not play a major part or any part at all, or of a piece of natural beauty (say, a billion-light-years distant nebula) that has never been and perhaps will never be viewed by human eyes. Intuitively, an ecosystem can be working well, a many-colored nebula can be lovely or admirable even if no (human) appraises it as such. On this front, I think the ethical framework Adams provides is more plausible, other things being equal, than Boyd’s.

Traditionally, ethical thinking and practice have included principles and maxims related not only to the treatment of others and the cultivation of virtue but also attention towards one’s final end. This comprehensive moral view included what we might call first-personal, second-personal, and third-personal dimensions. That is, one important ethical question is who ought I to become? What is psychological order? A second is how ought I to treat you? And you me? A third is What is the proper purpose of human life? Where are we headed? [^6] Boyd, predictably, makes the same narrow move that many modern thinkers do — that of reducing all ethical thinking and practice down to “care for others”. When he talks about the particular contents of a normative ethics (to fill out the details of his metaethical framework) he seems to be thinking only of second-personal morality. When he summarizes the “problems we face in trying to care for each other” as largely “features of social, economic and political structures” (531). He does not think much about human welfare as a species of excellence (say, enjoying excellence as Adams has it), where individual, social, aesthetic, personal goods and so on all participate in the same kind of goodness. The point of these reflections is that the more values we include in our search for a cogent, unified account, the less plausible becomes the notion of homeostatic property clusters for natural kinds. Whether we look at the several different kinds of human goodness, or the innumerable different kinds of nonhuman (aesthetic, biological) goodness, even if we hypothesize that a homeostatic property cluster explains each one, it becomes more and more difficult to even imagine exactly which properties those might be, let alone how one set or cluster of properties is a good-making feature in such different entities.

[^6]: For example, Aristotle writes about eudaimonia as participating in the life of god (3rd-person), about justice (2nd-person) and about moderation (1st-person).  


 
###Virtue Epistemology
On a related point, Boyd’s discussion of epistemic norms assumes that “good explanations” can be epistemically good without being morally good. Adams is right to say that Boyd’s discussion of epistemic norms is the weakest and also the most opaque of his essay. On Adams’ account, moral goodness and epistemic goodness are both species of excellence related similarly back to the (one) infinite good. This latter account much more plausibly fits the prima facie facts. 

I can here only gesture to the growing field of virtue epistemology.[^7] The intuitive premise, according to Ernest Sosa, is this: “Rational beings pursue and value truth.”[^8] Truth is a value; truth is a good thing. My attaining true beliefs is a good thing, and ought to be pursued. This sense of goodness is not, surely, that of moral goodness in the most narrow sense. But are the two senses completely divorced? When a scientist fakes his data and thus demonstrates a defective devotion to truth, we do not hesitate to apply the term bad, without qualification. Intellectual fraud is, among other things, a moral error. If the (correct) epistemic norms we hold and accord to are or plausibly can be moral-value-laden virtues, then all of the reasoning Boyd constructs on the edifice of a presumptive (moral) value neutrality must be rethought.

The [second] criteria above demands we respect the parity between epistemic and moral norms, between virtues of intellect and will. Boyd denies this parity without argument. Unless he can explain why we should not, we will continue to treat these norms as sharing something in common, even while being distinct. 



These considerations are not decisive; they are not meant to be so. As Boyd points out, the relative merits of the metaphysical accounts behind Boyd (atheism) and Adams (theism) will change the background plausibility of the metaethical accounts. But also, might not the sword cut the other way? Perhaps we should say that the relative merits of our metaethical account will modify the plausibility of our metaphysical theory, be it theistic or atheistic. Our metaethical account examines our ethical stance, after all, a stance which is as close to us as our very hearts. Our examinations of theism and atheism are liable to be aiming at a putative reality foreign and far outside us. 

Nagel's general direction -- start with defeasible morally realist presumptions and build from there to metaphysics and epistemology -- is right. I am more certain that I ought to care for my children and respect my parents than I am convinced all the world is not exhaustively material nor all the world just my perceptions of an unknowable ideas. 

Regardless, our sensitivity to both the “progress” of new truths in natural scientific inquiry and the (relative) stability of at least some truths of ethical inquiry can better explain the reality of goodness, our epistemic access to it, and our successful deployment of ethical terms, points to a framework more like Adams’, where the good itself is transcendent and yet many (and very different) kinds of things can be good by relation to it. The philosophical naturalist who refuses — rightly so, I think — to retreat to moral antirealism has a tough road ahead. He must fully articulate a plausible framework either that accounts for more natural kinds of goodness, or for other kinds of goodness that are not immediately like natural kinds. But much more so, he must fill in the details of real, natural goodness.






##Scientific Ethics 2 - Frank Jackson’s Functionalism

Frank Jackson is a physicalist, moral realist, and cognitivist (though he laments that epithet). He sees the main problem with moral realism as (an iteration of) the location problem. The key question is how to ground the “meaning of ethical ascriptions and sentences in purely descriptive terms.” (Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics 113). 

In thinking through Jackson's sophisticated and influential arguments, things are going to get heavy on the metaphysical side of metaethics. 
 
Frank Jackson’s From Metaphysics to Ethics defends the entailment answer to the location problem. The location problem is roughly how to locate ethical or semantic or other queer properties in the world understood in reductive, physicalist terms. Where is truth, meaning, goodness? The entailment answer is roughly that all the subvenient facts (of sub-atomic physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) entail all the supervenient facts (of psychology, ethics, etc.). Just as solidity is not a feature of the physical story of a physical thing but it is implicit in or entailed by that story about an interlocking atomic lattice, so tallness is not a property that features in the story about the physical heights of various people in the room but tallness is entailed by their various heights. 

Conceptual analysis is the process of drawing out these entailments and understanding the relation between base and supervenient property. Jackson defends “conceptual analysis” against objections that it is a mysterious search for the a priori or that conceptual analysis was discredited by Quine. 

He says metaphysics is about "what there is and what it is like", not a "shopping list" but a limited list that explains everything else.  The list of basic ingredients ought to be smaller than the list of explananda. 

“Serious metaphysics requires us to address when matters described in one vocabulary are made true by matters described in  another. But how could we possibly address this question in the absence of a consideration of when it is right to describe matters in the terms of the various vocabularies? And to do that is to reflect on which possible cases fall under which descriptions. And that in turn is to do conceptual analysis.”

He is a cognitivist in that hbalfoure thinks “ethical sentences are truth-apt... semantically able to have a truth-value.” (Jackson 113). Cognitivism is compatible with subjectivism, so long as the ethical judgment in question (say, “I like that”) is semantically able to have a truth-value. Since language is a physical tool (sounds and signs and so on) for conveying information, to “represent things as being” this and not that way (Jackson 114). Language — at least, language about contingencies — sorts out possibilities into categories of those that are and those that are not. This account includes conditional statements like ‘If P then Q’ where “competent speakers [say such things] just when the conditional credence of Q given P is high enough in the circumstances for assertion” (Jackson 116). 

In the “Role of Folk Theory” Jackson summarizes and endorses a few folk or common sense judgments about ethical properties. 


Ethical and normative properties referred to by ethical terms like “rightness” and “wrongness” are real properties. He clarifies that he is “not taking a stand on the debates over universals in analytic ontology, but merely affirming that truth supervenes on being, and that successful predication supervenes on nature” (Jackson 118). 

Ethical properties supervene on descriptive properties, meaning that for any two possible worlds if they have all the same physical properties then they have all the same ethical properties. 

The role that “rightness” plays in folk morality serves as a raw material from which to start and goal toward which to strive when looking for the descriptive condition (call it M) that is extracted by the Ramsey-Lewis method. But not just any current folk moral proposition will serve — it must be mature folk morality. Mature folk morality is “where folk morality will end up after it has been exposed to debate and critical reflection” (133).  Ethical properties supervene on the comprehensive list of physical properties in question. 

The divide between “is” and “ought” is not a divide between semantics. Jackson says, “I have to regard the purely descriptive terms as essentially given by a big list of terms that would generally e classified as such, and see the aim of the exercise as the analysis of ethical terms in some way or another in terms of this big list” (120). Moore would object. Moore’s assertion that goodness is a non-natural property Jackson summarizes as the claim that “what is left of language after we cull the ethical terms is in principle inadequate to the task of ascribing the properties we ascribe using ethical terms” (121). I could not, sans evaluative terms like ‘beautiful,’ ‘lovely,’ ‘shapely,’ ‘lush,’ ‘gorgeous’ etc., really describe what a rose looks like by just describing its color, shape, size, chemical composition, lifespan, etc. 

Jackson is agnostic about whether mature folk morality will indeed ever converge into one, coherent, universally agreed-upon whole. He believes it will, but accepts the possibility that a fundamentally plural set of moralities is in fact the mature set (Jackson 137).  


The bottom line, however, is clear: “any ethical way of carving up how things are is equivalent to some descriptive way of carving up how things are” (Jackson 139). This is a strange conclusion: it is in one way too open and in another way too closed. It is too open about exactly what description will correlate isomorphically to a particular evaluation. He has concluded that it is possible that what is right (evaluatively) will have in every case some descriptive correlate. What he hasn't concluded is that what is right is what “maximizes expected hedonic value” or any other such thing. This openness Jackson seems to prize, calling it “ecumenical” (Jackson 142). But I don’t see why he should. On my view, we already know that maximizing pleasure is, on balance, a good idea. Most pleasures are innocent pleasures that involve no corruption. Most pleasures *can* admit of excess and so when they are combined with moderation can be enjoyed. What we don’t know (or maybe some of us know but the rest of us don’t agree) is whether the meaning of the term and fact of maximizing pleasure is identical to the meaning of the term and the fact of goodness. Jackson's conclusion is too closed in that it makes moral progress or moral discovery a species of scientific progress or factual discovery. On my view, we already know what it will take something more than scientific discovery to open new moral horizens. Jackson's thought makes the saint someone who through experimental methods discovered something new about the world, a new description that correlates to a new evaluation. The astonishment we feel at moral heroism is just a species of the astonishment we feel at first learning, say, that sub-atomic particles can act on each other at a distance, or that time is relative to the speed of light rather than vice versa, or that water bears (tardigrades) can survive in deep space. I find this highly implausible. The saint is someone who astonishes us with magnanimity, patience, courage, extraordinary love, and so on — who opens up distinctively moral horizens. 

	
##Open Questions

The open question argument applied to Jackson is fairly clear: even supposing that an action A has the proper descriptive property D under conditions M such that it satisfies the role mature folk morality assigns to rightness, is it actually right? That is, does it satisfy my (or our) assigned role of rightness as we understand it today? 

Jackson defends himself against the open question argument in two ways. The first defense is that mature folk morality is still maturing and so we should not expect it to be complete. Some ethical truths are not extant and won’t be for an indeterminate amount of time. Some openness is to be expected. If we ask him “is it actually right?” he can respond that we don’t know for sure but time will tell. 

Two critical responses, at least, are called for. The first problem is that “time will tell” is not the right kind of openness. As Boyd makes clear, some ethical judgments are quasi-analytic in that they are so true it is almost inconceivable that they should ever turn out to be false; they could never imaginably be vetoed by any future discovery of physics or psychology. In Jackson’s terms, some pieces of folk morality are already maximally mature. The judgments, say, that torturing children for fun is cruel and that cruelty is wrong, (bad, impermissible, unlawful, disrespectful, unnatural, painful, vicious, or whatever other imprecation you like) have been sufficiently subject to debate and critical reflection. Indeed, I would argue that anyone willing to seriously “debate and critically reflect” on whether or not torturing children for fun is actually wrong by that very willingness demonstrates a moral defect. 

A second problem is that the term “mature” is evaluative. When some philosophers define truth or rationality in terms of an “ideal observer” who is fully informed and critically reflective, they slip into the descriptive definition an evaluative or prescriptive notion — that the observer is ideal in a positive sense. Jackson does the same. It would be too crude to paraphrase the notion of mature folk morality as the moral principles of people who are correct.  But there is something of circularity in trying to ground the evaluative property D in purely descriptive terms when one of our descriptive terms is evaluative. 

Jackson might respond that “mature” is only evaluative or normative about intellectual processes of debate and reflection rather than about ethical or practical processes of action or sentiment. Again, as we saw in response to Richard Boyd &lt;ref&gt;Boyd on intellectual or epistemic virtues&lt;ref/&gt;, evaluative terms like reasonable and rational are not ethically neutral. Arguably, they are centrally related to ethical evaluations. It is wrong to be intellectually dishonest. 


Jackson distinguishes what is open and what is closed abou folk morality by distinguishing “general principles broadly stated” (Jackson 132, original emphasis). The normative principles he cites are instructive: “killing people is normally wrong; we agree that people wo claim to believe that somethign is very wrong but show not the slightest incliniation to refrain from doing it are in some sense insincere; we agree that certain character traits associated with the virtues are intimately connected with the persons’ dispositions to o what is right; and so on.” (Jackson 132). The specifics are, however, liable to “a great deal of disagreement” (Jackson 133). 

Jackson includes in his account what I have called the paradox of knowing and not knowing the good. The distinction he draws is that folk morality gives us the raw material, so to speak, of most “initially appealing” parts of morality of which some parts survive as plausible by being vindicated by “critical reflection” (Jackson 134-5). For instance, utilitarians must give up (as an exceptionless moral rule or first principle or quasi-analytic statement) that it is always wrong to punish the innocent.


Anscombe criticizes utilitarian (or any other consequentialist) philosophy on just these lines. “It is a necessary feature of consequentialism that it is a shallow philosophy... it has in fact been the mark of all these [consequentialist] philosophers that they have been extremely conventional; they have nothing in them by which to revolt against the conventional standards of their sort of people; it is impossible that they should be profound” (Anscombe, “Modern Moral Philosophy”). The problem is that we might being “open” to reconsidering an ethical standard that should be closed. One fundamental aspect of being an ethical or moral person is refusing to reconsider certain norms. Anscombe continues, “But if someone really thinks, in advance, that it is open to question whether such an action as procuring the judicial execution of the innocent should be quite excluded from consideration‑-I do not want to argue with him; he shows a corrupt mind.” 

Jackson may not show a corrupt mind, but he does play the dangerous game of reconsidering quasi-analytic, necessary-seeming propositions. But this game must be played by any ethical theory. That’s just the way it goes. He says, “We tease out the consequences of the view or views under discussion; we identify those that seem most at odds with current folk morality— in other words, the consequences which strike us as most counterintuitive; and consider whether we are prepared after critical reflection to accept the consequences, that is, to modify folk morality so as to accord with them.” (Jackson 135). 

##Ramsey Sentences
A Ramsey sentence is a conceptual apparatus invented by positivist Carnap to explain why metaphysical questions are meaningless unless they can be translated into empirical sentences. 
Ramsey sentences take an apparently meaningful folk sentence like “Electrons are real,” empty the theoretical content, and replace it with empirical content that is supposed to do the same assertoric work. 

For a philosopher like myself who has never one been tempted by the charms of positivism — a hopeful but hopelessly incoherent dream that knowledge can be made clear, mundane, and irrefutable to any one with five senses — it is hard to build a conceptual structure on such a flimsy conceptual foundation as Ramsey sentences. But even so, let us take them seriously. 

One critique is that Ramsey sentences do not do the actual work of correlating ethical (prescriptive or evaluative) and non-ethical (descriptive) properties. They just show a theoretical way such a correlation might go. Jackson admits that ethical vocabulary is indispensible “in practice” (124). How does one acquire the possibly infinite disjunction of descriptive properties that correlates to the term ‘wrong’, and how does one deploy it in a dispute with one’s sibling, if one is only five years old? 


##An Objection or Two 

The sophistic charm of Jackson’s account comes from talking a lot about carts and horses but reversing the cart and horse. The true ethical properties make a possibly infinite disjunction of descriptive properties true, not the other way around. 

Jackson’s account points to a correlation — at best, an isomorphic correlation — between ethical and descriptive properties, between our uses of the term ‘right’ and the role, exhaustively described, played by rightness. 

“Fairness is what fills the fairness role; rightness is what fills the rightness role; and so on” (Jackson 140). 

David Enoch objects along similar line.

&gt;“I am going to grant that every normative property is necessarily co-extensive with a natural one. What I am not going to grant, then, is the identity of necessarily co-extensive properties. The common examples that are used as (purported) counterexamples are things like triangularity (having three angles) and trilaterality (having three sides), or the property of being the number 2 and the property of being an even prime,10 or – more closely to our context – the property of being an obligatory action and the property of being such that it is an essential property of God to command all persons to perform it (assuming some suitable version of a divine command theory).11 Intuitively, it seems that these are distinct properties, even though they are necessarily coextensive. Of course, proponents of the argument above may just dig in their heels, and insist that in these cases too the seemingly distinct properties are actually identical (though the relevant concepts may be distinct, of course). And so we find ourselves at a frustrating impasse” 
[@enoch2011 138-9](Enoch 2011,  138-139; Enoch, Taking Morality Seriously, 138-9).  
 

##Functionalism is not Metaphysics Objection
I have long puzzled over how functional theories (of consciousness, morality, etc.) have gotten by under the appellation of metaphysics. If I asked an astronomer what a planet is, he might reply with some examples: “Mars, Venus, Earth.” And if I pressed him to give me not just examples but a definition, he might say “a massive spheroid orbiting the sun.” But suppose I press him on that criterion by citing the 43 Kuiper Belt objects that are massive, spherical, and orbiting the sun. We are still, I think, talking about physical object. He could reply that we don’t exactly know what counts as a planet, but that size and the amount of orbital room the object has between its neighboring objects seems important to our definition. Well and good. But if he said that a planet is “whatever fills the planet role” he seems to have given up talking about physics and objects. Does he really mean that ‘whatever’ it may be that turns out to fill a planet role is a planet, whether it is physical or not? That it does not ultimately matter whether the object is even in deep space? For perhaps I could build pieces of architecture or technology that occupy the planet role, and could therefore build planets.

# Chapter x Objections, Clarifiactions, Conclusions
The labor of the essays comprising this dissertation has been to defend the claim that human virtue is not (merely) a part of nature, and that virtuous humans are not (merely) part of nature, if by nature we mean the non-living or the living non-human parts of existence. 
It has not been my task to defend the claim that virtue is real. Moral nihilism or radical skepticism are still viable “outs” from this conclusion for those who want to avoid it but who are persuaded by the dilemma. In this chapter I would like to very briefly address the anti-realist or nihilist option. Building off the moral realist arguments from Shaffer-Landau, Thomas Nagel, Philippa Foot, and more, I defend the claim that the best understanding of the facts of our moral thinking and the best explanation of our moral behavior are the realist understanding and explanation. Other explanations are so obviously false that they can only be tenable in light of the threatening consequences of becoming a realist. Other explanations are not soothing, comforting — they bring us face to face with the “horror of the normative.”
Philippa Foot concludes Natural Goodness with an essay on Nietzsche and moral skepticism. Is skepticism a rational possibility? 

###Draft 2
The labor of these chapters has been to defend the claim that virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is the most adequate explanation we have of a non-trivial set of explananda that puzzle us when we reflect on life as lived, and that the question of whether such a theory is ‘naturalistic’ is misguided. Ethical naturalism, depending on how one takes the term, is either inevitably going to succeed or inevitably doomed to failure. Such a range of intension is not philosophically tolerable. Rather, I have argued, the unambiguous and meaningful question is whether we must opt for a theistic ethical naturalism or an atheistic ethical naturalism. 


##Nature and God
Two broader metaphysical considerations merit a returning comment. The first is about the concept of nature. If nature is just that which is, then it is a truism and a tautology to say that naturalism is a true doctrine, where ‘naturalism’ is the thesis that only nature exists. Saying “only nature exists” just means, on this account, “only things with natures exist” or better yet, “only that which exists exists.” I dare say only a madman would earnestly disagree. 

So on the one hand the doctrine that only nature exists is true but trivially true. On the other hand, the doctrine is question-begging and (in my view) false. If “nature” is just physical stuff, then at least the statement “only nature exists” is synthetic and not tautologous. On this account, of course, naturalism cannot but be physicalist. There is no “relaxed naturalism” on this view. And it won’t do to assume physicalism without argument, especially in the face pressing reasons (from the ethical considerations about virtue inter alia) to believe some values and virtues and even our own human nature is not physical in this sense. But the present case is much worse than just begging the question. The attempt to clarify that takes “nature” to mean “physical stuff” will not do. Because the Greek word physis (φύσις) from which we derive “physical” — exactly like the Latin word natura from which we derive “nature — just means the inner core or essence or real substance of a given entity. To speak of God’s physical properties is quite literally to speak of what properties he has by nature, as opposed to by choice or convention or some other way. To say that the soul is physical is to say that the soul has it’s own nature, essence, form, underlying substance, hypostasis, or reality. At least, that is what those words might mean. So to assume that the very word ‘physicalism’ gets us to what we might want — a denial of spooky stuff — is already moving too fast, let alone assuming that the doctrine we are (futilely) expressing is true. 

What does the naturalist want to affirm or deny by claiming ‘nature’ as his own special metaphysical or epistemological ally? Perhaps she can take recourse to ostensive definitions. Ostensive definitions (like Frank Jackson’s) point to familiar exemplars of natural objects, tables, mountains, badgers, stars, etc. and define ‘natural properties’ as those ‘needed to give a complete account of things like them” (183, quoting Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics, p.7). First, a non-naturalist can “insist that moral properties” need be included in a complete account. Secondly, we cannot just assume that tables, mountains, badgers, stars are merely physical in that what appears to be is fully what is. It turns out that the table appears solid but is composed of an interlocking sub-atomic lattice shot through with empty space (or so we now surmise). Since ‘atom’ in Greek signifies ‘uncuttable’, the “atoms” of the early 19th century are not actually atomic; what seems to be uncuttable, the smallest elemental bit of matter, turns out to be composed of hadrons (either baryons or mesons), which hadrons are composed of quarks, which are composed of... etc. As scandalous as it may sound, not even physical things are necessarily just physical. 


##What are we trying to explain? 
The explananda that our metaethical theorizing aims to explain is not easy to define. Here are some things I don’t think we are trying to explain: we are not trying to give moral guidance to the morally confused. Most people have firm moral convictions on a wide range of issues. Theists have ready-made moralities on a wide range of issues given to them, they take it, by god. Atheists as it happens often have a wide range of moral beliefs based on the responsibility we have as humans if we are alone in the universe and solely responsible for our destinies, our disasters, and our hopes. In An Atheist’s Guide to Reality by Alex Rosenburg, as a popular middlebrow example, he lays out how atheists ought to approach personal, interpersonal, and political challenges that life puts before each of us. By contrast, Peter Kreeft’s  Making Choices is a theistic version of much the same guide. There are certainly moral disagreements at a cultural level, [which we have already had occasion to mention: abortion, sexual ethics, family ethics, international law, legal policy, foreign policy, poverty and wealth, religious freedom, freedom of speech, etc.] and within sub-cultures and even within each of us. But disagreement is most often between parties dedicated to a firm moral conviction. We are therefore not doing metaethics to give the morally confused a bit of advice. We are usually doing metaethics to examine why we have the moral beliefs

What we are puzzling over is normativity. In light of naturalism broadly construed — in light of modern empirical science and reductive philosophy — we are puzzling over the contrast between norms and everything else non-normative. Everything that is puzzling, from naturalistic assumptions, about moral norms is equally or almost equally puzzling about epistemic norms, as Professor Cuneo has labored to show. For this reason, it would be wrong-headed and myopic to speak only of moral norms. 

We are not just examining a few words, like ‘goodness’ or ‘right.’ To read some metaethicist literature, one would think that the only puzzle about ethics is the perpetual recurrence in all evaluative and normative discourse of the English word ‘good.’ We are not just puzzling over language merely but intentionality in thought, speech, discourse, and in deliberation. That is, normativity as it shows up in everyday utterances like “that was a good movie, thanks for the recommendation” or she is a good teacher; you should take her class” but also much more: Normativity shows up in my private thoughts (“how can I lose weight? what is wrong with my health?”) in communication (“what do you think of your Sienna? Is it better or worse than your old Odyssey?”) and in deliberation (“what is to be done with Iran? Is Guantanomo Bay to be shut down?”). We are trying to explain the pervasiveness of normativity. 

First I have to show you why it needs explaining. Then I have to show you why a paradigmatic moral realism enriched by virtue theory is such a satisfying explanans. Finally, I have to show you why other some other theories are not so satisfying on some or all explananda. Some of these theories at which I will level critique are virtue theories, but others are not. The ones that do not rely on (or even mention) virtue I show to be significantly conceptually impoverished by contrast to virtue theoretical approaches. The the ones that do rely on virtue attempt to remain in the fold of naturalism broadly construed. So I have to show that such an attempt is misguided. My argument that trying to make virtue theories naturalistic is misguided has two parts: the first that “naturalism broadly construed” gives up on the core naturalist tenets that motivate naturalists to avoid non-naturalism in the first place. Such a broad construal is naturalistic in name only. The second part that naturalism excludes the notions of virtue altogether.

Is our good limited to our biology?

It seems that what is good for us, the full Ranger set of good actions, good dispositions, good character traits, virtues, admirable qualities, intellectual virtues, etc. are fully determined by our biological nature, our status as mammals, our status as organisms, our status as living items in the natural world.

One. For the semantic and linguistic structure of a valued of judgments about human behavior and character are identical in the salient respects to evaluative judgments about plants and animals. foot.

2. Neo Darwinian orthodoxy says that the prime directive, the and, the final cause, the function of all living beings is to reproduce. Or to live long enough to reproduce. Or to live, to survive as an individual, and as a species, species survival which necessitates reproduction. This is Steven Brown's view.

I answer, what is good for us is part of what is good simpliciter determined by our human nature which is part biological and part rational nature. 

To circumscribe our good to our biological goodness, what is good for our body, is a mistake on two points. One, as Socrates pointed out, our psychology is far more important than our biology. Two, one would have to reduce all psychological flourishing to biological. This prospect is dim. Even if it were to happen in the distant future, it hasn’t happened yet and doesn’t seem likely. 

1. This is partly true but not fully true. To go partway is a mistake, but a different mistake then going to wrong way. To rectify it you do not need to change directions, but keep going. Our  physiological nature determines some things. Putting arsenic in a glass and drinking it or offering it to another is wrong. But there is nothing, I suppose, categorically wrong about it.  The wrongness if you like super jeans on facts about our body and digestive system and facts about arsenic that entail that arsenic consumed would kill human being. The species of intelligent Martian for him arsenic was not poisonous but tasty changes things. 

2. Non-reproducing humans are not ipso facto defective.



2

Is good limited to human or rational interests?

1. It seems that what is good is only a category existing because of or known only to humans because humans are, so far as we know, the only rational creatures in the cosmos.


Is rape really wrong? 
It seems that rape is not wrong. For rape on rare occasion leads to pregnancy and new life. As with lower animals, a resistant female being the unwilling carrier of a strong male’s brood leads to that individual’s genetic proliferation and to the survival of the species. 

On the other hand, rape is clearly wrong. 

It is not merely lack of consent. It is violence done to the heart of a person. 


####Is  the meaning of 'good' fixed a posteriori by 'what is good for human flourishing as individual, society, and species?'

1. It seems that it is so fixed, for what else could 'good' refer to but what is good for us? 
2. Also, 

On the other hand, we are supposed to care for the environment partly for our sake and partly for its own sake. 

I answer, every living thing has a good. And even some nonliving things plausibly have a good, or deserve treatment in some way. Artefacts and natural objects might demand something of us; we might be governed by norms with respect to them. 
Imagine this thought-experiment: Joe is sitting on his porch one day in Wilmore, Kentucky, sipping a glass of bourbon on the rocks. An interdimensional being suddenly appears at his side. The being appears both benevolent and intelligent. After some effort warming up its vocalizing organs (quite unlike our lung/tongue/larynx system), it utters, in English: "Hello Joe. I am from distant universe completely unlike yours. You will never reach it by technology or magic, but we can freely transport here interdimensionally. My people are dying of a grave and terrible illness. The only cure, our doctors and priests have discovered, is the blood of a human. A single drop of your blood, extracted in less than a second and without pain or side effects, would be converted to an anecdote and mean the difference between our extinction and our survival. The prophesies indicate that you are to be that human, but we could be wrong. In fact, due to a miscalculation of the severity of the illness, if we do not act immediately, our demise is near. Will you allow me to extract the tiniest drop of your blood?" 

Now, science fiction is useful for rendering interesting scenarios. The question is, is Joe obligated to give his blood? There is not, I think, any conceivable benefit to Joe. The procedure will not be pleasurable; it will not increase his health (and there is some reasonable fear that it might harm him, despite the being's assurances); it will not increase Joe's wealth; it will not appreciably affect his reputation -- in fact, if he tries to *tell* anyone about the interdimensional being, he stands to lose. The *only* benefit I can imagine Joe receiving is the peace of mind, in quiet hours and in old age, that he (may have) helped a distant race of intelligent beings. And it is hard to see how what makes this peace of mind pleasant except the thought that *I feel good because I did the right thing* . It is ridiculous to suppose he thinks  *It was the right thing because it feels good.*

The point is this: The norms that we ought to treat other rational agents as we (rational agents) want to be treated are just that universally-applicable and binding. Where seconds before Joe didn't know of the existence of these interdimensional beings and wouldn't have believed it if he heard of them in a story, now (through its speech and earnest plea for help) he recognizes them as, in a real sense, his brothers and fellow creatures, evolved from the same protoplasmic life in another universe or breathed into by the breath of the same God. At the same moment Joe knows that they exist, that they are rational agents, and that they need help,  at just that moment the norm springs into place and acts with full force, prohibiting, permitting, and requiring certain courses of action freely available to Joe.

Moral realism — a family of views whose core thesis is: there are (some) moral facts; moral knowledge is (the sometime) knowledge of moral facts, and moral terms (sometimes) successfully referring to those facts feature in our evaluative discourse. 

Epistemic realism —  a family of views whose core thesis is: there are (some) epistemic norms; knowledge is (sometimes) obedience to these norms; and terms (sometimes) successfully refering to the facts feature in our discource. 
—-----

##Introduction thoughts
Moral realism is a defeasible presumption. That means it's true that there are moral facts until we can prove that it's false with a really sound objection. Naturalism claims to provide such a really sound objection.

 The objection is that values are just too different from facts. I call this the "disharmony" objection or the "radical discontinuity" objection. The feeling is that, at bottom, all of reality must have a commonality and unity to it. All the various *realities* must connect up somehow. This feeling is, I believe, behind Darwin's search for a common ancestor for all the multitudinous life forms we see on the earth (not to mention in the fossil record). Why else would anyone, aware that there are billions of beatles, birds, whales, marmots, guanamos, gnats, elephants, and dogs even *think* of searching for one organism that -- however long ago -- is their universal parent?  
 
 Thomas Nagel has said that the apparent discontinuity between "objective" and "subjective" -- and exploring the two-- defines almost all his works.[^16] Stephen Brown says that a "fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature" (Brown 2008, 4). 
 [^16]: Nagel thinks that the two perspectives are irreconciable. Our best bet is detached, disinterested awareness of both perspectives. When affirming one seems to make impossible affirming the other? Affirm the paradox. 
 
 On this objection, if values are different from facts, if moral facts are so different from nonmoral facts, then something must be wrong. 
 
Their are a variety of available responses to the dissonance objection. One is to give up naturalism: 

* Moral facts are nonnatural but they're real, so get used to it. Reality just turns out to have two fundamentally different and in a sense irreconciable kinds of facts. This is G.E. Moore's and Shaffer-Landeau's choice.  
*  Another is to give up moral realism. Nature is real; values are not natural (or they're just too different from the natural) so these putative values or moral facts have got to go. This is Mackie, Ayer, and Gibbard, Blackburn et. al., 
*  A third way is a spectrum of negotiations and compromises with naturalism that each attempt to keep as much moral realism as possible while doing as much justice as possible to our respect for science. This third way is what I am interested in. It's not that I do not see how one could give up moral realism, I just cannot do it. I find it psychologically impossible to live as if it *might* be OK for me to, rather than feed and clothe and educate my kids, to put them in a freezer. [^15]

 [^15]: ![Woman puts kids in freezer](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/detroit-bodies-found-freezer/70419644/)


For instance, we could say that only nature is real and only what is natural can be known but argue that values and moral facts and so on are natural. But what do we mean by natural? 

* Could mean that values are endemic to human nature, to humans, and that humans are natural. Examples: John McDowell, Philippa Foot.  
* We could mean that values are features of the natural world just like natural kinds. Example: Richard Boyd. 
* Values could be natural the way that health is natural and anything that produces health. Example: Paul Bloomfield.
* Still others might argue that values are natural that supervene on normal natural facts the same way psychological fax super being on normal physical facts. Example: Frank Jackson.

But the fundamental tension between "inside" and "outside" might itself be a misunderstanding. That seems to be one of John McDowell's main points. 

What if the objection from discontinuity or dissonance is misguided? It seems that "science" supports reductive materialist metaphysics but what if our "respect for natural science" demands nothing of the sort? Then the objection against realism weakens. And its inherent plausibility and truly amazing explanatory power shines forth again unabated. 

###Demystifying values as "just part of human nature"
Some try to naturalize values by just putting them all  (or discovering them all) within humans. I don't think this strategy works. It doesn't demystify values, it re-locates the msytery. If all these mysterious non-factual value thingies floating around with no apparent connection or meaning in the natural world are all somehoe internal to human nature, and humans are natural, then all those values are natural, right? Yes, or human nature has just become non-natural. We used to have a "fact/value" split but now we have a "fact/human" split. 

To see how human rising values doesn't demystify values that actually makes humans mysterious, consider the cycle of euphemism. A phenomenon like human fecal matter is impolite to talk about. So we invent a euphemism like "feces." The euphemism works for referring to the same stuff without impoliteness for awhile. Then some kids get ahold of the term, realize what it means, and (having no taste) find it uproariously funny. They make enough jokes to *impolitisize* the polite term, shucking its dignified veneer. We invent another euphemism like "scat". To my knowledge, no one has yet turned "scat" into an exclamation expressing surprise or disapproval.  

To his credit, McDowell sees the parity of epistemic and moral norms. He wants to subjectivize moral norms, so he accordingly subjectivizes epistemic norms. Virtue and reason are *both* transcendental idealized processes, intersubjective human processes, objective enough for our purposes and to explain the objective purport in our thinking, feeling, and acting, but subjective enough to respect the distinction between human nature ("second nature") and *nature* nature (primary nature). 

Even so, second nature remains radically discontinuous from primary nature. Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. 





## Finlay
Finlay admirably summarizes the meta-ethical landscape with a taxonomy of views. The pressue is to satisfy objectivity (no values, just facts) and subjectivity (values). Michael Smith says something similar: "The task of the philosopher in meta-ethics is to make sense of ordinary moral practice. But the problem is that ordinary moral practice suggests that moral judgments hve two features that pull in quite opposite directions" (Smith 1994, 11). 


## Theses

1. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of human nature. 
2. Humans are natural -- that is, we are radically continuous with nature.
3. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of nature. 
4. To begin our understanding of ourselves by studying all that is not us (stars, trees, rocks, amoeba, giraffes) is insane; to begin our understanding of all that is not us (physics, chemistry, botany, biology, astronomy) by studying ourselves is perfectly reasonable. 
5. Nature includes *ends* (teloi) as well as value-properties like goodness and beauty. 
6.  Normativity for human nature means: We really ought to think in certain ways and act in certain ways.
7. Number six is not all of nature's normativity. 
8. Excellence and beauty are both goods but different from each other.

## Self-Written Reviews 

"Buhler has written an important contribution to metaethics. And an impressive analysis of both metaphysical and normative ethical issues in the ongoing discussion of naturalism." John Smith, University of Iowa

"When people ask me what naturalism is, I no longer point them to David Papieneau now, but the introductory chapters of Buhler's book. It resoundingly refutes a few nonsensical positions, clarifies a few sensible ones, and highlights the most reasonable." 

"Moral realism's fire is burning hot, and dealers book helps us to see that this is not A flash in the pan. Moral realism especially combined with virtue theory, is the most powerful! We have of the world we live in, the people we admire, and the people we aspire to be." Scott Smith

"A pugnacious and tightly argued cogent case for metaethical realism, sensitive to the historical context of these long-standing debates, but dancing circles around the faulty presuppositions of contemporary thinkers."

"A book of resounding philosophical common sense bristling with persuasive arguments and adorned with, I dare say, wisdom."

            <Title>Criteria for Metaethical Theory</Title>
            <Text>My metaethical theory is a positive version of virtue ethical theory. Virtue theories provide strong explanatory power over a range of phenomena of human thought, action, and speech. But before I say more, I need to answer what is the goal of metanormative inquiry. What are we trying to explain? 

Just the word ‘good’? 
The way some metaethicists talk you would think the only goal is to explain the semantics and pragmatics of our use of the word ‘good’ and that’s the end of it. 
This myopeia is partly this is due, I think, to Moore’s prefatory statement in Principia Ethica that the primary goal of ethics is to explain why we call things good when we call them good. 
Also, good is specific enough that we actually do use it in everyday speech (we speak of our “good students”) and in philosophical discourse (Plato’s form of the good, Kant’s good will) while remaining general enough to represent simply the “positive” or “up” side of evaluative discourse about anything.
But restricting metaethical inquiry to investigating our use of that one term is a mistake. To reduce all the ways in which our life is dappled with judgments of value, pursuit of what is worthy, avoidance of what is base or trivial to ‘evaluative discourse’ is a mistake. Surely, we want to explain value talk. But we also want to explain the things we talk about evaluatively. To me it seems a laughable mistake. It is as if a metabiologist thought she could assert something meaningful and interesting about giraffes, hippopotami, bacteria, humans, sea slugs, and pterodactyls by explaining ‘life talk.’  Surely there is something interesting going on when we use the same word (‘alive’ or ‘living’) about such a diverse set of creatures but don’t use it about crystals, solar systems, or the wind. But to ignore all the particularities of different life forms in their highly various manifestation is to ignore all the particularities and varieties of ‘life talk.’ 

Not not all human goodness is moral goodness
Another reason to think metaethical inquiry is indistinguishable from metanormative inquiry as a whole. We need to be able to explain more than evaluations commonly labeled as ‘moral’. For example, we should want an explanation for why we think stupidity is bad even if it is not morally bad. 
For these reasons, metaethical inquiry is part and parcel of a global metanormative theory that seeks to explain all kinds of evaluations, evaluative judgments, evaluative discourse, and is sensitive to the variety of objects which we evaluate. 

The problem of agreement
There is another criterion that sets a limit on, and a research goal for, metaethical inquiry. I call this the Problem of Agreement. A metaethical theory should explain why humans so often and so globally agree on certain value judgments. It should explain moral platitudes entrenched in “folk morality” and why they seem so right even to sophisticates and intellectuals. I am thinking of platitudes like cruelty is wrong but also ones like friendship is valuable and family first.  Even if such platitudes turn out to be norm-expressions rather than propositional judgments, or truth-apt but not true, they had better turn out to be something very like the truth. Simon Blackburn is one who shoulders the burden of showing why, given that realism is basically wrong, realist talk is so ubiquitous. The problem of agreement should receive no shorter shrift than the so-called problem of disagreement, a phenomenon that underwrites far more wild interpretations than is justifiable.Cf. David Enoch, “How is Moral Disagreement a Problem for Realism?” % 

Criteria are falsifiable and hence negotiable
I do not wish to make my criteria seem non-negotiable. An argument could be made to show why what I have called a puzzling phenomenon is not so. Either the alleged phenomenon doesn’t happen or it’s just my idiosyncratic perspective that makes it puzzling.  I think these are negotiable but right. 

Why am I sometimes wrong? 
An example of a criterion that we might want to begin with but, upon reflection, should abandon: why am I always right and others always wrong? This is the kind of question many of us, if we are honest, have set about trying to answer at some point or another. A better criterion is that my ethical theory should explain why I am sometimes or even usually right, but why I can be mistaken. It should even, as a practical theory, or at least as a theory when applied, help me to identify mistakes and correct them. 
Or we might have asked: Why is my group right and others always wrong? (Michael Shermer’s Why People Believe Weird Things is an exercise in this kind of futility.) Also Nietzsche’s sardonic essay “Why I am so Wise”?) The question is not why are “they” wrong and “we” are right but given that we are mostly right, how might we be going wrong? Given that “they” are mostly wrong, how might they be getting it partially right? 

The Criteria for metanormative theory
The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are five. In brief, they are: the unity and diversity of ways things can be good; the unity and diversity of ways humans can be good; the way goods can be good for one or many humans; our occasional certainty about what is good; our mistakes about what is good; our amazing range of failures and successes in actually becoming good; 

The Purport of Objectivity
Michael Smith summarizes one of the two ”features of morality" as "we seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts" (Smith, 1994, 8). Call this 

The Post-Kantian Picture
This picture of objectivity of value, of moral facts consisting of a set of facts “in the world” to which our representational epistemic states can correspond or fail to correspond, and which make the truth of our evaluative propositions, is itself a picture of the world and our place in it that is subject to controversy (Rosen, “Objectivity and Modern Idealism”). Once you accept a picture of reality in which there is a mind/world gap, then you are obligated to overcome the gap or explain it away. I endorse this picture of the world, even if it seems to violate a tenet of naturalism that has become for Rosen “philosophical common sense”. The reasons for endorsing that picture will fill up many pages below. 


The Purport of Certainty 
Ethics is a less precise science than geometry. Aristotle said that we ought to be content with the degree of clarity afforded by the subject, since any more clarity would actually be less clear. To capture a fuzzy reality our account must be correspondingly fuzzy. To capture a fuzzy reality too clearly is to falsify the account. 
Descartes and Kant deplored the less-than-mathematical precision of philosophy (and hence ethics). They sought to make it either just as mathematically precise as geometry, astronomy, physics, logic, algebra or else deny it the honorific title of a science. 
Our metaethics must answer this question: should ethical inquiry be as precise as other forms of systematic, organized, theoretical knowledge? I do not think so, but I will not attempt a full defense here. Instead I will point to one phenomenon I take to be in need of explanation. 
Let it be given that ethics is more fuzzy and less precise than, say, physics or astronomy or archaeology. In this case, it makes sense that many of our evaluative judgments are tentative, probing, hypothetical, provisional. When I ask undergraduates whether they are for or against abortion, say, or for or against Obamacare, they often express bewilderment, aporia, a desire to learn the various reasonable positions, a sensitivity to objections and counterarguments, the provisional nature of their conclusions, the hypotheses they inherited from friends, family, or pastors. When I ask them whether they are going to go into a career or family life, into sciences or humanities, live near family or move away, they express uncertainty in no uncertain terms. This is as it should be. We are often (rightfully) unsure what is right and what is wrong, both personally and politically, both morally and prudentially. It takes time and many hours of deliberation to sort through what to do and what to believe.
Even so, there are some evaluative judgments about which we tend to be more certain than even factual judgments. And our metaethical theory should account for the fact. 
For instance, I am more certain that I ought to honor my father's memory than I am sure about his birthday (he was adopted and his parents memory agreed with one birth certificate but disagreed with another). I am more certain that the world is beautiful than that gluons (as conceived by present day physics) exist. I am more clear that I ought to care for my children than I am that Pluto is or is not a planet. I am more justified in believing that I ought to trust my wife’s fidelity when I am absent than I am justified in believing that most of the dinosaurs were eradicated by a catastrophe. All of my factual beliefs, in these cases, are open to more empirical evidence and new theorizing. But my evaluative beliefs, in these cases, are case closed.  
I will put it even more strongly. Cruelty is wrong, kindness is good — these are so true and so known to be true that I can hardly doubt them without ceasing to be myself.  To be open to reconsidering these platitudes constitutes a moral failing. 
I intentionally avoid controversial examples about which some people are so screachingly certain but about which others are equally certain about the opposite thesis. The point is not that certainty guarantees truth. The point is that some evaluations, as they seem to correspond to the objective facts, seem to be certainly right. So we ought to explain why we sometimes know what is true (that cruelty is bad) as well as the seeming knowledge of what the truth is about (the moral facts about kindness). So we must explain how and why some evaluative judgments purport to be known with an incorrigible certainty while others purport to be only guessed at, hoped for, glimpsed “through a glass darkly.”

The Four Explandanda
With these general considerations, I can give my explananda. For each explanandum I will give a bit more detail and a few examples of the kind of evaluative judgments I am thinking of, drawn from history, books, movies, my memory, or my own brain: 

	1)	Unity and Diversity of Goods. We do not just evaluative people as good; we evaluate everything that exists and even things that don’t exist (“the Joker is a great villain; Bespin is a beautiful city). We evaluate living things as living well or poorly. We evaluate inorganic systems. We predicate not just goodness (“moral” goodness) but order, harmony, truth, or beauty to inanimate things. Order and goodness are not identical but they are both “positive” or “up” values. So we must explain not only evaluative discourse about humans but about non-human objects (stars, rocks, forests), non-human animals (deer, dogs, buzzards), and systems (ecosystems, galaxies, molecules) according to normative canons other than moral ones. (Cf. (Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, Chapter 3 “Well-Being and Excellence”).  
Some examples:
	⁃	The stars are beautiful; the solar system is forming; Mt Shasta is beautiful when covered with snow; though hostile to us, the deep sea is a home (inorganic systems)
	⁃	The ecosystem is healthy; the beehive is flourishing; borax is bad for ants; the rainforest is being raped;  (living systems)
	⁃	The father and son are reconciling; their friendship has really lasted; she is rich; (human “non-moral” goods)
	⁃	It is rational to love truth; rational beings ought to proportion belief to the evidence; real scientists don't fabricate data; simultaneously to hold inconsistent beliefs makes one irrational; (human intellectual goods)
	⁃	Virtue is its own reward; “we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream”;  (human moral goods)
	2)	Unity and Diversity of Human Goods. 
	⁃	Not just “moral” but intellectual. We are judge ourselves and others on both our reason and practical reason. We judge our own and others thoughts and actions, beliefs and feelings. Practical reason gives reasons for practice — that is, it means there is such a thing as rational action. Without practical reason, we are left with impractical reason and irrational activity. But, as we clearly judge, we see both. Michael smith says, regarding practicality, "moral judgments seem to be, or imply, opinions about the reasons we have for behaving in certain ways and, other things being equal, having such opinions is a matter of finding ourselves with a corresponding motivation to act" (Smith 1994, 6-7). Now, Smith himself thinks these features are opposite each other. Beliefs  — correct or incorrect — about facts are "utterly distinct" from desires, and never the twain shall meet. But my point here is that practical rationality is broader than narrowly “moral” or even “ethical” concerns viewed as a set of absolute prohibitions or imperatives binding on all humans as such. 
	⁃	Sam is wise; Yuan is a good guy; those two may be cretins but they’re the smartest people in our department; parents ought to care for their children and children ought to respect their parents; friends ought to remain faithful even in times of sorrow and trouble; Jose was tempted but he did the right thing; Lindsay has earned it, I hope she enjoys the accolades; willfully to disregard the evidence for historical atrocities against people groups whom you happen to dislike is an intellectual and a moral error; ignoring evidence contradicting your hypothesis is an intellectual error; you are not a real scientist if you falsify evidence to support your hypothesis;  (evaluations of action and thought)
	⁃	Not just action, but character. I don’t want to prejudge how necessary virtue concepts are to explaining the way we actually think, but it seems to me a confirmable hypothesis that we judge ourselves and others on our character, habits, and overall way of life. We admire not only the good but the wise and look down on not only the wicked but the foolish. Furthermore, we judge ourselves and others as good, beautiful, faithful, friendly or the opposite of these, paradigmatically consists in judging not only their actions but especially their established character traits. A good person is one who has achieved a good set of character traits and employs or “activates” them habitually; a bad person is the opposite. The kind of person who earns our distrust is one who has proven reliably untrustworthy, who is reliably unreliable. 
	⁃	Pat did well… for once; what you did was wrong, but you’re not a bad person; Sam is wise those 9/11 firefighters were courageous; Cato is just. 
	⁃	Not just luck, but reaction. We hold ourselves and others accountable not for what luck has given them but for what we think, say, and do. We hold ourselves accountable, ultimately, for who we are insofar as that is a combination of what is out of our control (luck) as well as what is in our control. 
	⁃	It’s terrible what happened to Susan, but she’s bearing up rather well; Even with all that wealth and privilege, she’s managed to turn herself into a wretch; 
	⁃	Not just rational bipeds, but any rational being. Interestingly, we intuitively judge any hypothetical being the same way. We can judge the moral status of fictional villains like Galactus and the Joker or fictional heroes like Professor Xavier and Batman. Non-theists can judge whether a particular god as portrayed in literature or speech is admirable or not. If we ever discover extraterrestrial life say on Mars, we will not blame a bacterium for harming our astronauts nor praise one for curing terrestrial colds. If we discover or are discovered by extraterrestrial intelligence, however, we expect both to treat them with respect and to be treated with respect. If we ever meet with another intelligent life form — whether god, angel, or Alpha Centurion — we expect them to also obey the Golden Rule. The law of mutual respect or decency is not just a provincial terrestrial contract. 
	3)	Unity and diversity of human communities. I am not totally sure this is a separate criterion. But some goods we judge to be good relative to persons and others good for communities or groups (be they societies, cultures, peoples, nations, clubs, races, families, associations, or what have you). Sometimes these judgments are in tension, sometimes in harmony. 
	⁃	As a political animal, it is easier for me as an individual to flourish in a flourishing family, society, and state. 
	⁃	It is easier for my family, society, or state to flourish if I am flourishing as an individual.  
	⁃	Sometimes the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many: I ought to help my struggling first-generation college student to understand a concept even if the rest of the class already “gets it”. 
	⁃	Sometimes the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few: a majority vote in democratic society is sufficient to establish “the will of the people”, even if the minority are discontented. 
	⁃	Sometimes the general welfare is incompatible with my personal welfare, or at least my pleasure and comfort. Sometimes I ought to prefer the general welfare at my own expense (I ought to recycle plastics and papers even if it means buying another recycling can from the city) while other times I ought to prefer my welfare to the general welfare (when accepting a raise, I ought to use the money for my own purposes rather than donate all the extra to charity). 
	4)	Superlative Human Goodness (and badness). Some people are moral monsters, some people are saints. If our ethical theory does not account for this, then it is impoverished. Some people are not just decent but exceptionally admirable, heroically virtuous. Each of us has moral heroes, I believe, unless we are so deluded or so great that we believe ourselves morally superior to anyone we have yet come across. 

	⁃	That firefighter is paragon of courage; Sam is a sage; Jose should be elected Sheriff because he always does the right thing; Lindsay deserves every blessing she has. (I am carefully trying to break Godwin’s law.) John Maximovich is a saint; Mitchelle Blair (who allegedly murdered her children and stored them in a freezer) is a monster. 
	⁃	We must account for how some exemplary good people become so good, so benevolent, just, kind, caring, compassionate, powerful, joyful, and wise — and how some people become exemplary villains, examples of vice, debasement, wretchedness, and misery. 

Are you just cherry-picking? 
Each of these needs alleged phenomena comment. Objections could be leveled against my choice of explananda to the effect that cherry-picking explananda is a way of fixing the race in favor of one or another future explanation. The worst academic sin I could commit early on would be to beg the question against a rival explanans merely by cherry-picking explananda. 

Examples from literature
To defend the first criterion, I have assembled a sort of sample from art, literature, reality television, anecdotal examples, history, and political discourse. The specimens of this sample are not, clearly, chosen at random. They were chosen with the criterion in mind. If my point were to show the features of a random sample, this sample would be a poor one. But that is not my point. Rather, I am to show *how easy* it is to gather examples of normative evaluations of various kinds deploying identical (English) terms for an apparent diversity of phenomena.

How do we "explain" anything?

Explanations explain phenomena that puzzle us. There are, in many cases, competing explanations that can't both be true but that are both plausible. If I find a broken window in my home office and a stick on the ground, on the face it may be that some neighborhood menace was breaking windows for fun, or that my tree outside lost a branch in the wind. An explanation is (always?) underdetermined by the data. 
 
There are two ways to offer an explanation: as an argument (contending against others) or as a framework (aiming for consistency and coherency and plausibility). When offering the first kind of explanation qua argument it is necessary to attack other frameworks and defend one's own. When offering the second kind of explanation it is necessary to fully explicate the theory, drawing out aspects and clarifying or defending them. The plausibility of a framework then depends, for the reader, on how plausible and satisfying the framework is as a whole rather than the relatively less satisfying alternatives. 

Metanormative realism is an explanation of the second kind. As a framework, it answers many of our biggest questions while leaving room for research. Furthermore, it is very intuitive. It enjoys adherents among philosophers and regular people alike. If it is to be displaced, I think it needs a fairly strong objection or series of objections.

2. **Character** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials.
6. **Diverse Normativity** — explaining the parity between epistemic and moral norms, modal "norms" or laws, aesthetic norms (in contrast to the absence of a parity between etiquette norms or preferences);
3. **Diverse Finite Goods** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest);
4. **Heroic Virtue**- accounting for how some people become so good they are exemplary, they become saints or sages; 
5. **Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** —  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others; we know for instance that cruelty is bad and kindness good more firmly and clearly and irrefutably and incorrigibly than we know some obvious non-normative facts like that ice is cold or objects fall toward the earth (the exceptions are imaginable, even though surprising); 
7. **Practical Reason** - explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons. 

Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole.

Metanormative Realism
Now, some things that cannot be explained might need to be explained away. Thomas Nagel mentions that the rules of grammar are such that they feel objective, real, and binding… but they aren’t. He does not endorse his own pre-analytic sense that the grammar rules he learned in grade school were not just taught ex nihilo but in a way enforced or passed along. But Nagel is obliged to give us (and indeed he does give) an account of 
(A) why he thinks grammar rules aren’t really real rules, and
(B) why they might come to seem so real without being so. 

But the “defeasible presumption” as he calls it is that they seem real because they are real.Mind and Cosmos and elsewhere.  And indeed, the existence of certain norms makes sense of our evaluative discourse and our action-oriented lives. If, for instance, it is true that ‘each rational person ought to pursue the good’ then it makes sense that each person actually does pursue the good or feels, when they don’t, that they really ought. Our practical reason (phronesis) and our practical motivation are explained by our being the kinds of things we are: rational animals. As animals, we are subject to certain motivational states and dispositions: we prefer sufficient warmth, food, light, shelter, water, and companionship to frigid cold, hunger, darkness, exposure, thirst, and loneliness. As rational animals, though, we are sensitive to norms. We are sensitive to a “space of reasons”John McDowell quoting Wilfred Sellars, I believe. Some of those norms tell us what to do even when it contradicts our animal motivations. ‘Wake up and feed the baby’ overrides ‘Go back to sleep!’, even though the latter yells louder. 
Are such norms real? As presumptions, we should consider objections to the effect that they are not real. As defeasible, we should expect that hypothetically some objections are fatal and would necessitate rejecting the belief that such norms are real. 

When I survey life as lived, and compare the various metaethical theories I have been exposed to, I come across these puzzles. These explananda constitute the primary puzzles of this dissertation. What are we trying to explain? 

On metanormative realism, some moral and epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents, and that such norms are best explained in terms of human nature (what we are), human flourishing (our end), and human virtues which are the means to flourishing. 

There are a series of questions to which the best answer is that there are real norms or laws of thought and behavior that govern creatures like us. I lay out [a number] of criteria for what an adequate metaethical theory should explain. These criteria are, I hope, non-controversial. They are or should be eminently common phenomena that we can all relate to. 

Defend against nihilism?
My first task in defending my primary thesis *could have been* to rehearse some of the arguments against normative nihilism, norm expressivism, etc. Instead, I shall argue that normative realism is a reasonable "defeasible presumption”. Cf. Thomas Nagel, Mind and Cosmos We should trust unless weighty objections arise. 

Disharmony objection introduced
 The objection is that values are just too different from facts. I call this the "disharmony" objection or the "radical discontinuity" objection. The feeling is that, at bottom, all of reality must have a commonality and unity to it. All the various *realities* must connect up somehow. This feeling is, I believe, behind Darwin's search for a common ancestor for all the multitudinous life forms we see on the earth (not to mention in the fossil record). Why else would anyone, aware that there are billions of beatles, birds, whales, marmots, guanamos, gnats, elephants, and dogs even *think* of searching for one organism that -- however long ago -- is their universal parent?  
 
 Thomas Nagel has said that the apparent discontinuity between "objective" and "subjective" -- and exploring the two-- defines almost all his works.  Stephen Brown says that a "fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature"Brown 2008, 4.  Nagel thinks that the two perspectives are irreconciable. Our best bet is detached, disinterested awareness of both perspectives. When affirming one seems to make impossible affirming the other? Affirm the paradox. 
 
 On this objection, if values are different from facts, if moral facts are so different from nonmoral facts, then something must be wrong. 
 
Their are a variety of available responses to the dissonance objection. One is to give up naturalism: 

* Moral facts are nonnatural but they're real, so get used to it. Reality just turns out to have two fundamentally different and in a sense irreconciable kinds of facts. This is G.E. Moore's and Shafer-Landau's choice.  
*  Another is to give up moral realism. Nature is real; values are not natural (or they're just too different from the natural) so these putative values or moral facts have got to go. This is Mackie, Ayer, and Gibbard, Blackburn et. al., 
*  A third way is a spectrum of negotiations and compromises with naturalism that each attempt to keep as much moral realism as possible while doing as much justice as possible to our respect for science. This third way is what I am interested in. It's not that I do not see how one could give up moral realism, I just cannot do it. I find it psychologically impossible to live as if it *might* be OK for me to, rather than feed and clothe and educate my kids, to put them in a freezer. [^15]

 [^15]: ![Woman puts kids in freezer](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/detroit-bodies-found-freezer/70419644/)

I then show that 'naturalism' provides exactly such weighty objections. But 'naturalism' is a a "philosopher's weasel-word."[^15] A naturalistic thesis, when clarified, will turn out to be one of a few kinds of thesis:

            <Title>Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods</Title>
            <Text>Robert Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods 
Oxford University Press, 1999. 
Overview:
The good is transcendent and infinite; the good is god. This metaphysics of morals makes best sense of moral semantics. The primary finite good is intrinsic excellence. 

Synopsis:

Introduction: Finite and infinite goods—many finite and one infinite. This book proposes a framework for ethics that is organized around a transcendent Good and its relation to the many finite goods of our experience. Two main themes contained in this idea should be emphasized at the outset: the centrality of the good, and thetranscendence of the infinite Good. I begin with the latter.
I.	The Nature of the Good 
1.	God as the Good. This chapter introduces the book's central theses about the nature of the Good: that God is the Good itself, the definitive standard of excellence, occupying roughly the role assigned to the Form of the Good or the Beautiful in Plato's Republic and Symposium, and that the excellence of other things consists in a sort of resemblance to God. These are presented not as claims in the semantics of morals, about the meaning of “good”, but as claims in the metaphysics of morals, about the nature of goodness or (more precisely) of excellence. The chapter explores philosophical issues about these views and their implications regarding the nature of God.
2.	The transcendence of the Good. This chapter considers how far we should expect beliefs to be confirmed in the same way in ethics as in science, and argues that precisely by setting limits to empirical confirmation in ethics, the thesis of the transcendence of the Good enables theism to provide more adequately than naturalism can for a critical stance that is important to ethics. The Good's transcendence, its surpassing all other good things and all our conceptions of the Good, is understood here in qualitative and positive rather than formal and negative terms, and as supporting an open‐endedness in ideals of human life.
3.	Well-being and excellence. Intrinsic excellence holds a primary place among types of value in the theory developed here. Today, many moralists are reluctant to grant such a place to excellence. Well‐being (what is good for a person) is a much more popular type of value. In vindication of the centrality of excellence, this chapter argues that well‐being is actually best understood in terms of excellence, as a life characterized by enjoyment of the excellent; whereas currently the most influential type of theory of well‐being, in terms of desire‐satisfaction, cannot adequately account for the ways in which people often desire what is not good for them.
4.	The Sacred and the Bad. Badness is not understood here, in parallel with goodness, as resemblance to a transcendent Bad. Rather it is understood in relation to the Good, as privation of goodness, more gravely as opposition to goodness, or in the most horrifying cases as violation of something sacred. This chapter takes a widely shared sense of moral horror at certain actions as a clue in developing the relevant concepts of violation (here preferred to that of defilement) and the sacred. The treatment of the sacred in terms of images of God provides a context for an account of the special value of persons as persons.
II.	Loving the Good 
5.	Eros. This chapter argues that Eros is an intrinsically excellent as well as beneficial form of love that deserves a place in our conception of God's love and in our ideal of human love. As Eros is conceived here, its central feature is relational desire: the lover desires or prizes, for its own sake, some relationship with the beloved, where the beloved is typically a person but may be an impersonal object such as mathematics or philosophy. It is argued that Eros is not always selfish or even self‐interested, though it is essentially an agent‐centered motive.
6.	Grace. Grace is conceived here as love that is not completely explained by the excellence of its object. This chapter argues that authentic love, divine as well as human, necessarily has something of the character of grace. That is because what is truly loved must be loved for its own sake, and hence with a certain particularity and noncomparative appreciation. The chapter considers what sorts of reasons for love, and what grounds for ascribing universality to God's love, are compatible with this particularity.
7.	Devotion. This chapter defends devotion to the Good as such, or to God, as an integrative ideal and organizing principle for human motivation. It explores ways in which the infinite good or God can be loved in loving finite goods with full particularity. Ideas of higher order preferences and of alliance with God, and with those who love the Good play an important part in this integration of loves.
8.	Idolatry. Not all devotion to good things is good. Under the heading of idolatry, this chapter offers a partial anatomy of good motives gone bad. This subject is discussed (1) in relation to priorities and excessively consuming passions, (2) in relation to inappropriate “needs” and the sense that life would not be worth living without particular finite goods, and (3) in relation to misidentification of finite goods with the supreme Good.
9.	Symbolic Value. This chapter argues that it is good to care about what one's actions and one's life symbolize, express, and stand for, and good in some cases to act for the sake of such symbolic values in preference to more extrinsic and more tangible consequences because expressive action provides a way of being for important goods, a way that is especially important in situations of relative helplessness (though not only there). This argument is related to conceptions of martyrdom, eschatology, and worship.
III.	The Good and the Right
10.	 Obligation. This chapter argues that obligation (unlike goodness or value) is essentially social, being a matter of what is required of persons by persons in a context of social relationship. The social nature of obligation is discussed in relation to social and psychological sanctions, to guilt, and to the reasons, which valuing one's social bonds gives one to take social requirements seriously. The chapter also argues, however, that human societies are not good enough for their requirements to define morally binding obligations.
11.	Divine Commands. This chapter defends a divine command theory of obligation, proposing God as the one whose requirements are good enough to define morally binding obligations. It discusses (1) the history of divine command metaethics, (2) the reasons for treating divine commands as morally binding, (3) the advantages of conceiving of obligation in terms of divine “commands” rather than divine will, (4) the nature and epistemology of divine commands, and (5) the compatibility of divine commands with human autonomy.
12.	Abraham’s Dilemma. This chapter addresses the greatest fear about divine commands – that God may command something evil – focusing on a modernized version of Genesis 22 (influenced by Kierkegaard), in which Abraham finds it difficult to reject any of the following jointly incompatible beliefs: (1) whatever God commands is not morally wrong to do, (2) God commands me to kill my son as a sacrifice, (3) such human sacrifice is morally wrong. It argues that divine command theorists should not reject (1) but that in any cultural and religious context in which the dilemma can be taken seriously, (2) is the belief to reject.
13.	Vocation. This chapter argues that the moral life needs good projects, engaging one's love or commitment, that are one's own in a morally valid way, and that the concept of vocation is helpful in structuring this aspect of the moral life. Vocation may be conceived in terms of either a command or an invitation from God. The argument here suggests that it will normally be a matter of actual goods that are given to one to love, and that it should be connected with a conception of one's selfhood. This conception is defended against act consequentialism as a way of identifying one's own moral tasks.
14.	Politics and the good. This chapter argues, contrary to some leading versions of political liberalism, that considerations of excellence have a legitimate place in political ethics, and even in the most plausible grounding of the civil rights that most concern liberals. It defends the pursuit of excellence from charges that it must offend against a reasonable egalitarianism. It argues also for a type of separation of church and state, and for contextually sensitive state action to promote and protect widely recognized goods involving excellence.
IV.	The Epistemology of Value
15.	Revelation of the Good. This chapter proposes a doxastic practice epistemology for ethics, holding that we rightly, and probably inescapably, rely on belief‐forming dispositions that we have formed in learning social practices of evaluation. In the context of a theistic metaethics, the reliability of such practices and dispositions is explained in terms of a concept of “general revelation,” a concept that allows that some to whom ethical truths are revealed may be atheists. The chapter also expounds a conception of “special revelation” connected with historic religious traditions, in which particular possibilities of goodness may be empirically discovered and divine commands may be addressed to particular communities at particular times.
16.	Moral Faith. Theistic metaethics has been suspected of imposing on morality a need for faith. This chapter argues that morality has such a need in any case, with or without theism. It argues this with regard both to faith in morality itself and to faith in moral ends (for instance, faith that human life and the moral life are worth living). It explores cognitive, volitional, and emotional aspects of moral faith.




Precis
1.	Introduction: 
a.	Two themes: the good is central. The good is transcendent. 
b.	The good is god. He aims for “a comprehensive, up‐to‐date philosophical account of what a theistic framework for ethics might look like. Such an account should not limit itself to the relatively abstract topics of the nature of the good and the right, but should also explore ways in which a variety of religious concepts may enrich the texture of ethical thought.” 
c.	Loving the excellent and doing one’s duty — both are important but loving the excellent takes precedence. The good being (first of all,) intrinsic excellence rather than human well-being — including aesthetic and intellectual excellence as well as fidelity to interpersonal obligation. 
d.	It is a “framework” so more broad than metaethics — he will include primary ethical discussions of love, etc. But it should accomodate other religions. 
e.	He will not argue the existence of God or make a pass at the problem of evil. 
f.	God is the good or th ebeautiful. Everything else is good by resemblance, more or less, to him. The good always transcends the finite goods. The kind of goodness he is is intrinsic excellence. 
g.	Our relation to the supreme good does not consist merely in doing good — but first of all being for or loving the good. 
2.	The Nature of the Good
a.	Introduction
i.	Beauty itself is transcendent, and “all other beautiful things are beautiful by “participating” in it (Symposium 211b). 
ii.	Beauty is a species of good.
iii.	It is not instrumental goodness (usefulness) or well-being (good for a person), but that which is “worthy of love or admiration”. Adams will call this “excellence.”
iv.	Identifying the transcendent Good with God is not surprising — Philo and Augustine do so. 
v.	We are not talking about Forms or universals, but of value. 
vi.	Forms are sometimes treated as universals, sometimes as exemplars. God as the Good is a concrete (though not a physical) individual — and a person or “something importantly like a person.” 
vii.	The Good explains both moral and non-moral value. 
b.	The semantics and the metaphysics of value
i.	The switch of style and method to “analytical” philosophy is motivated by the belief that we ought not talk about the natures of things but about the meanings of words that signify them — from the good to the term ‘good.’
ii.	Adam’s thesis that finite goods are good insofar as they have resemblance to God is not about the term per se but the nature of goodness. 
iii.	The approach to avoid doing analysis of language exclusively is to distinguish questions about natures of things from questions about terms and meaning. 
iv.	For example, ‘water is H2O’ may be a true statement about water’s nature without being needed to fix the reference of the term ‘water’ to the clear liquid stuff we can identify ostensibly. 
v.	Analogously, the term ‘good’ “may be related to the nature of the good in something like the way that has been proposed for natural kinds” (16). 
vi.	As Plato (Socrates) describes the Good as the end of every action that the agent does not adequately grasp, so it is. 
vii.	The good itself (the nature of the good) may be referred to by various words, and the word ‘good’ in various contexts may pick out different things. An adequate account of the good (itself) need not explain every contextualized use of the term ‘good.’
viii.	The contexts we are looking at are those in which the term ‘good’ likely means ‘excellence,’ not well-being or usefulness. 
ix.	Goodness may be a property of states of affairs, but beauty can be a property of persons, physical objects, poems, mathematical proofs, qualities, deeds, lives. Beauty or excellence are probably not properties of states of affairs in general. 
x.	“Maximization of the sum of excellence in the world (if such a sum can be computed), or of the degree of excellence attained somewhere in the world, may not itself be excellent.”
xi.	Insisting that we account for every use (in every context) of the word ‘good’ “stack[s] the deck” in the favor of noncognitivists, since sometimes we use the word with no other meaning than a general feeling of approbation, a favorable attitude. 
xii.	Our use of the terms ‘good’ and ‘goodness’ and their cognates when we mean excellence has objective purport, as if we were speaking of a mind-independent property — they “favor realism.”
c.	Eros and the Good
i.	Goodness as excellence is not clearly “the object of every pursuit;” more likely it is the object particularly of eros or erotic pursuits (broadly construed to include “passion for justice or philosophy” etc).
ii.	 Eros pursues “its object as intrinsically valuable” and admires it before pursuing it. 
iii.	Desires do not always aim for the good (either by aiming for the not-good or failing to aim for the good) — but Adams is not providing a theory of the good in terms of the desirable. 
iv.	Error is “important to [his] theory” but not “unbounded scope for error;” we “cannot always or even usally be totally mistaken about goodness.”
v.	Goodness is the object of admiration, desire, and recognition (as good). 
vi.	Saying it is “excellent to value the excellent” and that “the excellent is what it is excellent to value” sounds circular, and threatens the notion of objectivity we are aiming for. 
vii.	Instead, our pursuit of the good (even without adequate knowledge of its nature) “determines what sort of thing would satisfy the pursuit” — if we saw the Good or God (after much effort) we would recognize it/Him as the thing we were pursuing (however imperfectly) all along. 
viii.	That answer still includes a value judgment, since the good would “best satisfy” the pursuit. Is this still circular? We must give up the attempt to “get value judgment out of the foundations of objectivity.”As he says, “My response is to suggest that our reasonable aspiration is not to get value judgments out of the foundations of objectivity, which is probably impossible, but to allow there only value judgments that are very plausibly objective. Judgments of closeness of fit can be very plausibly objective, if they are based on extensive knowledge and are not, intuitively, “close calls.” And the one and only factually omniscient being, if reflectively and unselfishly sympathetic, would very plausibly be classified as an objectively ideal judge.”
3.	The Transcendence of the Good
a.	Abstract: Is the good empirically verifiable? Is naturalism (immanence of value) or transcendence more suitable to “a critical stance”? Theism and the transcendence of the good, understood in qualitative, positive terms, makes more sense of an “open-endedness in ideals of human life.”
b.	Introduction
i.	Objectivity and transcendence are opposed to “all forms of subjectivism, noncognitivism, and antirealism about value” but also against realisms like “all forms of naturalism which would seek the nature of value exclusively within the horizon of the physical and human world.” (50). 
ii.	The good is “not exactly ‘at home’ in human life.” 
iii.	Excellence lies beyond our cognitive grasp and so is difficult to characterize, except by negative terms.
iv.	Saints are not best characterized as lacking flaws, being tame, etc — but as strangely and positively rich. 
v.	Holiness, goodness that is beyond human comprehension and human purposes, is not ‘nice’ but “fearful and in some ways dangerous.”
vi.	The holy person is “occassionally bizarre, and often unnatural.” 
vii.	If sainthood is “incorporated into” our ethical thinking, then it implies that “the full development of the normal and natural is not the capstone of ethical aspiration” contra Nussbaum.
viii.	Nussbaum affirms a “fully human target of complete virtue” (54). 
ix.	Is “complete virtue” a limited thing? Adams thinks not. Even Nussbaum admits that virtue will require tragic sacrifices.  Also, the golden means are often incommensurable.  Finally, fully doing one’s duty completely is not open-ended enough. Saints not only fulfill duties we know about but open up new horizons of duty we never dreamed of. Christ’s human virtue need not have been maximal and “complete” in a limited sense. 
c.	Naturalism
i.	 I have been leaving epistemological issues to one side for the moment, however, and exploring the role that explanations in moral terms play in our ordinary thinking, which is not dominated by the skeptical challenge, but by trying to make our way in life.
ii.	Moore is the paradigm Anglophone nonnaturalist; Boyd will serve as a paradigm or canonical naturalist. 
iii.	Boyd does not attempt to define the good. 
iv.	The good is a natural kind, a homeostatic property-cluster, that occur together, and in some cases of imperfect clustering is difficult to discern. They have “no analytic definition” (60).  Boyd is still a consequentialist. 
4.	The Sacred and the Bad
II.	Loving the Good 
5.	Eros
a.	Can God love finite goods? It seems not, if all new goods are either improvements on God (which is impossible) or not improvements (not desirable). Eros can be “appreciative contemplation” or “liking of some present good” and not just desire for an absent good or the futurity of a present good. 
b.	God’s Eros might be “uncertain of its future goods”, since people are free.  
c.	2. Is Eros self-interested? Being agent centered does not entail being agent self-interested.  
d.	He is not using (137) “eros” in exactly Plato’s nor exactly Nygren’s sense. 
e.	4. (142) the Value of Love’s interest in relationshiop. Is relationship lovable, or is it only benevolence to the other person in the relationship? Not utilitarian theories ascribe value to friendship itself. 
f.	We don’t just want benefits from our friends (instrumental goods) like money, we want their affection and regard for its own sake (143). We value his valuing the relationship for its own sake. 
g.	What do we value in a friendship? Some benevolence (consideration, kindness, generosity) some conscientousness ( trustworthines, reliability, dutifulness, patience, discretion, practical wisdom) appreciativeness (likes and enjoys other person, recognizes and celebrates strengths and excellences, gald of her existence, interested in friend herself not just well-being). 
6.	Grace
a.	Love that is not completely explained by the excellence of its object is grace. Human and divine love has something of grace in it.
7.	Devotion
a.	How do we love the infinite good by or through loving finite goods? 
b.	177 Interested in “agent ethics”. Adams is interested in “ethics of motive,” not just virtues and vices. 
c.	“Motive utilitarianism” evaluates motives by their consequences. Different from “act” utilitarianism.
d.	178 the value of art is “cannot be explained very well in terms of its utility.”
e.	179 motives are evaluated on the basis of the excellence of their aim. 
Fragmentation of value
f.	Nagel has argued that there are multiple, equally fundamental, incommensurable systems of value.
g.	For instance, “excessive high-mindedness”, interest in exclusively 2nd-personal morality, is bad compared to other kinds of devotion to athletics, philosophy, art. Adams agrees.
Integration of Value
h.	How to integrate? Ignore some values — judge from a non-normative perspective (brute willing?) or find a different top of the hierarchy besides (2nd-personal) morality.
i.	A subjective side of the question is how to suppress or resolve inner conflicts. 
j.	183 An objective side of the question is that utility or instrumental value does not “yield an adequate criterion of the ethical value of motives.”
k.	The “comprehensive point of view from which we can make sense of valuing motives on the basis of their objects” is goods (both human and nonhuman).
l.	Someone whose “heart is in the right place” is an ally who values goods...
Problem of Total devotion
m.	How can all these loves “organized around devotion to God” work? Is “maximal devotion to God demanded by theism ... compatible with love for anything finite at all”? (185 end of page). 
n.	Augustine’s solution, that we don’t “love” but “use” finite things won’t tell. 
o.	Plato’s worry was about the scandal of particularity. 
Love as alliance
p.	Religious life is freindship with god. Friends are allies, with common goals. 
q.	Can’t be accidental
8.	Idolatry
a.	Some devotion to good things is not good. Good motives gone bad can be idolatrous. 
9.	Symbolic Value

Quotes:
Consider the saints. We often think of the saint in essentially negative terms, as someone who never, or almost never, does a no‐no; or in terms of universal quantification, as a person all, or almost all, of whose actions meet a high moral and religious standard. This conception does not meet the test of reality very well. Saints, and especially the most interesting and attractive among them, are typically rough‐edged and controversial characters, liable to quite reasonable and often serious criticism from various directions. What is wonderful about them is nothing so tame as a freedom from faults, but something much more positive—and much stranger, as I will soon be arguing.1
Similarly, in thinking about the divine perfection, or the attributes of the being that is the standard of value, we should suppose that God's superiority exceeds our cognitive grasp in a positive direction, and is not exhausted by negative or universalizing operations on properties familiar to us. The divine knowledge, love, beauty are not just free from defects we can identify; they contain a richness we can hardly name.2 To us this richness is bound to b alien in ways we may find uncomfortable.”

If goodness is natural, then we should expect that goodness as it is actually sought and found by our race is familiar, ‘natural’ (in the sense that natural is opposed to artificial or forced). It ought always and only to relate to the flourishing of the human race collectively, or human individuals, or living races akin to ours (monkeys, dolphins), or living things in general. 
But neither of these consequents are true. So goodness is not natural. 
Goodness is often uncomfortable, a “richness we cannot conceive” rather than an absence of blemishes. 

Holiness is wonderful in a “way that escapes both our human understanding and human purposes.” Evidence in this favor is holiness is reflected but not contained in non-human aspects. The non-moral goodness (beauty, for instance) of a state of affairs or an aspect that is good. 

“The saints are occasionally flourishing specimens of humanity in all the obvious ways, but usually not. They feel compunctions, and are torn by doubts, that others do not know. They cling to a longing for goods that lie beyond any ordinary human possibility of attainment. Their behavior seems occasionally bizarre, and often unnatural. Kissing lepers and praying for people who are torturing you definitely do not seem natural responses. Indeed, I think it is often precisely in the unnaturalness, or better the supernaturalness, of the saints' goodness that their wonderfulness is found. In them it seems that we can glimpse or touch a goodness that is more than theirs, a superhuman, a transcendent goodness that we too long for.” (52-53)

 I have been leaving epistemological issues to one side for the moment, however, and exploring the 
role that explanations in moral terms play in our ordinary thinking, which is not dominated by the skeptical challenge, but by trying to make our way in life.

“ Like most philosophically interesting concepts, those of resemblance and of God are attended with their own questions for understanding. Nonetheless, most of us not only use the concept of resemblance with confidence (as we do that of goodness) but also think we understand that resemblances are grounded in features of reality.” (30 ish)

(143)	“We will not regard them as benefiting us in the same way if we do not think the other person values them for their own sake; and if it is right to think that the “enjoyment” of the illusion of a good relationship is not a true benefit, then we are not truly benefited by these relations unless the other person really does value them for their own sake.”

"One of my main aims in the present chapter is to combat an overmoralized ideal of love as pure benevolence, which would not allow God to desire, for its own sake, a relationship with creatures, or to love beauty or other impersonal goods. Benevolence must certainly play a major part in the divine love; but I will argue that noninstrumental interests in relationships and excellences should also be part of the ideal of love for us humans, and may reasonably be ascribed to God, and that something we can characterize as Eros may therefore appropriately be seen as a part of the divine love.

God loves. But God is the good. So God loves himself, does he love anything else? He does love others (contra Aristotle). He doesn't just have benevolence


Reflections
Adam’s book is excellent, but hardly amounts to argument. He may oppose many different ethical views — naturalism, nihilism, utilitarianism — but he does not have clear opponents. It is not a fighting book, but an exploration of ‘an ethical framework.’ That that framework has been the framework for western civilization for the last 2000 years will not, to some, commend it as interesting.

Discussion
“There is a more pressing difficulty, however, for the thesis that Godlikeness is sufficient for excellence. More decisive counterexamples to it are possible, involving holistic resemblance rather than mere sharing of properties.” (33). 

Is godlikeness by being powerful (sharing one property) 

Is resemblance objective? 
Yes (33). 
God’s judgment about 

What forms does excllence take? 
Alliance with the good — being for the good
Being for others who are allied with the good — necessary, but not sufficient. 


What kind of resemblance constitutes excellence
God is the judge. (36)
Excellence is an intersection or conjunction of being like god and that are reasons for god to love that. 

Not even God maximizes excellence. We are for it. 


Is beauty an excellence?
We do make judgments of beauty, and we do distinguish beauty from sublimity and other sorts of excellence. If our judgments of beauty track something objective, as I believe they do, they presumably are tracking some way in which experienced, mundane beautiful objects resemble each other, and in which they do not resemble sublime things universally or as such. In my view this will also be a way in which beautiful objects point beyond themselves to a transcendent ideal, and in which they resemble or image God. Sublime objects will also resemble or image God, but in a different way, related to the different way in which they resemble each other.


Chapter 2
His platonism makes sense of why there has never been a fully adequate ethical theory (one that gives us final answers). There is a qualitative open-endedness 


The good and well-being
Deep ecology recognizes non-human value, of the environment say. Non-human nature has its own intrinsic goods. An ecosystem has beauty.  It is somewhat platonist. Independent of human valuations or needs. If humanity were to disappear, would things still have value?

Is one of the virtues appreciation of beauty and the good in all forms? Foot might say this. 
Eudaimonists wouldn’t think this way. But theoreia is contemplation of the logoi of nature. 

Kant is explicit that the only thing that is good in itself is the good will. He is following Scotus, and before him Anselm. We have the will for justice and the will for self-satisfaction (or survival? something like that?) The moral struggle is the struggle for both of those. The moral will becomes the will for justice. For Kant you can fit in the ..


Aristotle a Hedonist?
Avoids it by saying that what is pleasurable by anture is different from pleasant to us. Intelligible by nature / intelligible to us.
The fully generous person takes pleasure in giving ... the friendly person genuinely takes pleasure in the company of others... not necessarily for us. 
The pleasure discussion itself (last part of Book VII and Book X) pleasure supervenes upon completed activity. The most natural forms of activity produce natural pleasure — and there are unnatural pleasures. It’s obvious that there are unnatural pleasures. 
The same is true for Plato. 

Flourishing
Flourishing is different from pleasure. Flourishing appears to be naturalistic because we use it for other animal species; we judge when the buffalo is flourishing based on its fulfillment of its characteristic activities, and some optimal conditions. We do that on the basis of our judgment of what nature is like. Dogs need to run to flourish. The dog doesn’t know what its missing. But we can recognize that is not dog flourishing. That’s straightforward. Try to transfer that to human beings. 

The human case is so much more complex. We have culture. Our culture evolves and changes. 
[MacIntyre includes in the good the freedom and ability to achieve the good, to define the good, to seek the good].  There is a kind of openendedness and indeterminacy to what it would mean to flourish. You can’t just take a human being — see he is not hungry, has reproduced, has shelter and clothing, and so that’s a flourishing life. 

Is flourishing a list? if so, how does one adjudicate when goods come into conflict? THe completeness of the list? The justification for the list? What criterion gets things on the list — happy things? Does it seem that their lives... 

Pleasure and Joy
NT uses “kaire” all over the place. Does it use “hedone” ever? The saints’ lives are not necessarily pleasant, but yes joyful. Paul says “make my joy complete” it’s relational. Hail Mary, rejoice, “Xaire” full of joy. When Symeon receives the child there is sorrow in this, and great joy. Joy is compatible with sorrow, and grief, and loss.... St John Climacus “joyful sorrow” — 
K: Why aren’t they both pleasure?
DBrad: Joy is relational in a way that pleasure is not. Asked parents with kids versus parents without kids — parents with kids were slightly less happy but more joyful. Joy is not a subjective state of consciousness at all, its an awareness of the range of life — what your life embraces — your life is broader.  There is more potential for loss and suffering. When you have children, they can be sick, deformed, you can lose them. Joy is inseperable from the openness to loss. That openness to loss is there because the breadth of life is greater. Whether it brings pleasure with it is a big question mark. 

Gregory Nyssa. Some activities are pleasant by nature. The ever-increasing cycle of the good, progress — with the acquisition of the good comes a growing desire for the good. He likes the mean between vices.

## Draft 2

This dissertation defends the thesis that norms are real and part of nature, that human nature is radically continuous with nature, but that nature is not to be understood as merely material or physical. 

The primary rival to my view is "naturalism" -- a family of views that are normally taken to problematize metanormative realism. I try to clarify these problems.  Upon clarification, it will be seen that either they are true but not problems, or problems but not true.

##Draft 11?

This dissertation defends the thesis that neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics are sufficiently naturalistic, but that ‘naturalism’ when clarified does not mean much. The interesting questions are whether neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is (a) true, (b), useful, (c), compatible with atheism, (d) compatible with physicalism. 




## Some Other Theses

1. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of human nature. 
2. Humans are natural -- that is, we are radically continuous with nature.
3. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of nature. 
4. To begin our understanding of ourselves by studying all that is not us (stars, trees, rocks, amoeba, giraffes) is insane; to begin our understanding of all that is not us (physics, chemistry, botany, biology, astronomy) by studying ourselves is perfectly reasonable. 
5. Nature includes *ends* (teloi) as well as value-properties like goodness and beauty. 
6.  Normativity for human nature means: We really ought to think in certain ways and act in certain ways.
7. Number six is not all of nature's normativity. 
8. Excellence and beauty are both goods but different from each other.

Rival Views motivated by naturalism
The main rival to metanormative realism of course is the belief that no moral or epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents. Why would anyone deny the appearances so firmly? The thinking is that naturalism demands it. 

The objection is that values are just too different from facts. I call this the "disharmony" objection or the "radical discontinuity" objection. The feeling is that, at bottom, all of reality must have a commonality and unity to it. All the various *realities* must connect up somehow. This feeling is, I believe, behind Darwin's search for a common ancestor for all the multitudinous life forms we see on the earth (not to mention in the fossil record). Why else would anyone, aware that there are billions of beatles, birds, whales, marmots, guanamos, gnats, elephants, and dogs even *think* of searching for one organism that -- however long ago -- is their universal parent?  
 
 Thomas Nagel has said that the apparent discontinuity between "objective" and "subjective" -- and exploring the two-- defines almost all his works. (Nagel thinks that the two perspectives are irreconciable. Our best bet is detached, disinterested awareness of both perspectives. When affirming one seems to make impossible affirming the other? Affirm the paradox.) Stephen Brown says that a "fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature”%Brown 2008, 4

 On this objection, if values are different from facts, if moral facts are so different from nonmoral facts, then something must be wrong. 
 
Their are a variety of available responses to the dissonance objection. One is to give up naturalism: 

* Moral facts are nonnatural but they're real, so get used to it. Reality just turns out to have two fundamentally different and in a sense irreconciable kinds of facts. This is G.E. Moore's and Shafer-Landau's choice.  
*  Another is to give up moral realism. Nature is real; values are not natural (or they're just too different from the natural) so these putative values or moral facts have got to go. This is Mackie, Ayer, and Gibbard, Blackburn et. al., 
*  A third way is a spectrum of negotiations and compromises with naturalism that each attempt to keep as much moral realism as possible while doing as much justice as possible to our respect for science. This third way is what I am interested in. It's not that I do not see how one could give up moral realism, I just cannot do it. I find it psychologically impossible to live as if it *might* be OK for me to, rather than feed and clothe and educate my kids, to put them in a freezer.Yes, this happened. Woman puts kids in freezer. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/detroit-bodies-found-freezer/70419644/

For instance, we could say that only nature is real and only what is natural can be known but argue that values and moral facts and so on are natural. 

Even among those who are persuaded by metanormative realism, there are several rivals. Each explains such norms as real in a different way. In order of decreasing similarity to my own conclusion, beginning with *most* similar, they are:

            <Title>Aristotle</Title>
            <Text>He is addressing the objection of the sophists that nomos is contrary to physis. In Politics I.2, he says that the nature is most fully expressed in a fully actualized political form. And of language and moral discourse indicating our political nature, diffusing the sophistic notion. The rest of Book I is asking which activities are natural? Some are more than others. Some forms of slavery, some forms of commerce (not usury), are natural. 

Human nature is to make nomos. We make nomoi, laws, customs, conventions, the same way spiders make wombs. Man is by nature a political animal. Our nature is fully realized only within the polis. A human being outside of polis is no longer a human being. They have lost their telos and lost their identity. Only in the polis do you see what human nature really is. Our capacity for constructive moral activity, and for moral reasoning and discourse — the characteristic of moral discourse in language and community. 

The thing about his teleology is that he gives you pieces in various works, never all at once in one work. That’s consistent with the physics, the final cause of any natural substance is equivalent to its formal cause. What that growing thing within nature is seeking to realize is the full realization of its own form. Politics is just a special form of that. But the trick is he also uses rainfall to say that rainfall exists for the sake of human agriculture or farming. Nature can also be viewed anthropocentrically. So how does that consist with PHysics II where every natural organism is realizing its form for the sake of its form. From a higher perspective, Metaphysics Lambda 10, he asks in what sense does the cosmos contain the good? Is it the way an army contains the good just be being structured well, or is the way the general embodies the good of the army by being the one who directs and mobilizes it? It’s both. God the prime mover is the good in both of those senses. The prime mover is self thinking thought that thinks all intelligible reality at once in full actuality — it is true in a sense that natural processes take place for our sake. Because we are nous present within nature. Physics I the “ergon” argument, we have logos, we have reason, that’s our defining feature, and that gives us our own ergon. In the theological context of M. L our nous means that we are in a partial limited way to the cosmos as God is to the cosmos. Capable of realizing those natural forms as intelligible objects and bringing them to an intelligible level of actuality. Doing that we partake of the activity that it means to be god. 

We gesture to that in the end of Ethics, human life is as the capstone element of this much larger cosmic structure. 

Even Marx picks up the notion that man is a political animal by nature — some forms of capitalism are unnatural. </Text>

            <Title>Whose Justice, Which Rationality? </Title>
            <Text>The concept of tradition does important work for MacIntyre. A tradition is not mere conservatism of Burke or contemporary political pundits; that kind of conservatism is part of the broader tradition of liberal individualism he critiques. He calls a living tradition “an historically extended, socially embodied argument, and an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition” (222%). 
The book that works out more fully his theory of tradition is Whose Justice? Which Rationality? Here, he tells the story of “three distinct traditions, from Homer to Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas, from Augustine to Thomas Aquinas, and from Augustine through Calvin to Hume)” (Lutz %). The modern liberalism of the Enlightenment and beyond denies being a tradition or having a tradition, yet bears all the telling marks of a tradition. 
This book also works out a theory of rationality. Rather than the disembodied, timeless, and universal concept of rationality touted in the French Enlightenment (the goddess Reason), he argues that one’s conception of rationality is something constituted by one’s tradition. 
“Reason” for MacIntyre is not a bare calculative faculty but a whole messy bundle of ways of assessing truth and falsehood. </Text>

Naturalist objection clarified
This leads to the question of whether ethical norms are 'natural'?  Are moral facts, or what I am calling simply 'norms' natural? This seems like a pressing and substantive question whose answer will affect much. After doing the research for this dissertation, I no longer think it is a pressing or substantive question. It is not just vague but hopelessly vague; not just ambiguous but fatally ambiguous. 

There is a danger that labels, which are useful for categorization, storage, and quick reference of arguments and beliefs, become more important than substantive arguments. I take my metaethical view to be a brand of normative realism, emphasizing moral norms but using epistemic norms as allies. I take my normative ethical view to be a brand of virtue ethics. Talk about virtues, human nature, and flourishing or happiness I find the most helpful in solving knotty metaethical puzzles. Sometimes, as Thomas Nagel reminds me, the only solution to metaethical puzzles is to stick to primary ethical tools. 

So, what we mean by ‘natural’? What we  — friends and foes of metanormative realism — mean by ‘natural’? 
* We could mean that values are endemic to human nature, to humans, and that humans are natural. Examples: John McDowell, Philippa Foot.  The core concern here is to save the appearances but respect as much scientism as possible. 
* We could mean that values are features of the natural world just like natural kinds. Example: Richard Boyd. The core concern here is atheism.
* Values could be natural the way that health is natural and anything that produces health. Example: Paul Bloomfield. The core concern here is humanism.
* Still others might argue that values are natural that supervene on normal natural facts the same way psychological facts supervene on normal physical facts. Example: Frank Jackson. The core concern here is physicalism.

But the fundamental tension between "inside" and "outside" might itself be a misunderstanding. That seems to be one of John McDowell's main points. 

What if the objection from discontinuity or dissonance is misguided? It seems that "science" supports reductive materialist metaphysics but what if our "respect for natural science" demands nothing of the sort? Then the objection against realism weakens. And its inherent plausibility and truly amazing explanatory power shines forth again unabated. 

4. Are these norms "natural"?
	* Are these norms radically anomalous? Are they strange, queer, discontinuous? 
	* Are such norms physical/material? (Nagel, McDowell)
	* Are such norms divine? 
5. Where do such norms come from? Do they happen to emerge from our biology? Do they come from the mouth of a god? Are they necessary features of our rational nature and other other creatures with a rational nature? 

My claim is that: 

1. These norms are 'natural' but that the question 'Is X natural?' is almost vacuous. 
	* These norms are not radically anomolous. They are not strange, queer, discontinuous.  (Nagel)
	* These norms are not material. (Nagel, McDowell)
	* These norms are not emergent properties arising from our biology. (Foot, Brown)
5. These norms are internally related to human nature (via practical rationality). (Foot, McDowell, Kant)

For the purpose of these essays, I remain agnostic as to whether these norms come from any particular personal god. But I do claim that they are divine. The contrast is likely to strike the reader as strange. By 'divine' I mean that they transcend our animal biology and that conformity to them makes us rational, acting creatures full of wisdom and virtue.  Affirming the divinity of some norms is consonant with a variety of theistic views: Aristotle's god is neither Brahman nor Jehovah. 

But insofar as 'natualist' is just a label for 'atheist,' then my argument entails that naturalism is false. But I deny the charge that my view is "non-naturalistic." Insofar as 'naturalist' is a label for 'one who believes in the radical continuity of facts, the uniformity and harmony of reality,' I vehemently claim the label as my own. In order to claim the label as my own, I must show that they are mistaken who think reality is radically continuous because reality is fundamentally physical or material. 

The best evidence that reality is not fundamentally material is human nature, rationality and practical rationality, including primary norms. 

Having removed the teeth from the overriding motivation to be "naturalistic", these rival views turn out simply to be half-hearted substitutes for virtue. They are not even properly "rivals" nor are they clear-headed. The clear-headed work to be done is to clarify objections to virtue theory and articulate better answers and explanations. </Text>

            <Text>## Virtue ##

### MacIntyre’s Project: An Invitation to Restore Virtue ###

The abiding theme of MacIntyre's ethical writings has been the invitation to give up on the hopeless elements of our modern liberal tradition and to return to Aristotelian (and Thomistic) tradition of virtue. This invitation assumes that our modern tradition is fatally flawed, that some parts at least are hopeless; and it assumes that the tradition of virtue will cure what ails. It also assume that moderns — even putatively “anti-traditionalist” moderns — a part of a “tradition.” I shall comment on both of these assumptions below. 

#### Audience
MacIntyre’s ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. 

#### Influence
MacIntyre's influence has been remarkable. Many have declined this invitation, but many have accepted it. Those who decline are more or less content with modern ethical and political thinking, offering corrections and improvements but not major overhaul; they find  MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. Those who accept tend to be more dissatisfied with the present modern culture, modern morality, and modern politics. 


### Philosophical Imagination
The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) is not a demand -- it really is an *invitation.* Readers who are discontent with modern culture and morality may well find MacIntyre's solutions compelling. Readers who are not so discontent may find something of interest in his criticisms; if not, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would this be a good solution?"</Text>

            <Title>### Moral education, end of life</Title>
            <Text>### Moral Education 

Often the biggest and most obvious facts are the hardest to see. For example, when I ask students to point out anything they see — anything at all, hidden or apparent —  they typically look around and start naming medium-sized objects in their field of vision: this chair, that wall, that tree, that person, or perhaps those atoms and molecules, that sunlight. They never say the biggest and most obvious thing: the ground. 

When discussing the morality of adults, we often leave out the biggest and most obvious source of our morality. The source of our morality is not our professors in college, our ethics textbooks, our favorite novel, or even (for religious folk) our Holy Bible. The biggest and most obvious fact about our morality (and our moral psychology and a whole lot else) is our parents. 

Most of us grew up in the context of nuclear families. So our biological parent or parents both conceived, raised, cared for, and educated us — including education in do’s and don’ts of life. 

The reason we must keep parents in mind is that the two most significant periods, in one sense of significance, of our ethical lives are the very beginning and the very end. 

The latter phase of human life, say, from 50-80 (for those who live that long) is the period in which our habits are most firmly established and the consequences of our choices are most apparent. There is a time delay between the decision to cultivate a character trait and the rewards (or punishments) of becoming that kind of person. 

The middle period (say, ages 25-55) are where we are most autonomous. We are fully functioning agents. We have projects, aims, goals, ethical principles (or a principled lack thereof), weaknesses, given temptations, vices, defects, as well as strengths, virtues, and a host of other habits we may call morally neutral. This is also the period when we philosophers tend to write books about morality. But just because this is the period in which moral philosophers write books about morality doesn’t mean this period is the most moral significant. 

There is a truism that all the really significant doctrines about life — all the really impactful beliefs and habits — we don’t learn in school; we learn them all by the time we enter school (around age 5). We learn how to relate to other humans, how to relate to authority, how to speak our native language, we learn (for the most part, but not exclusively) what is valuable in life — learning, money, position, friendship, power, and so on. </Text>

            <Text>On the Concept of Nature
John Dewey described himself as a naturalist. I am not sure what he meant by this self-ascription. I am not sure anyone else is sure. What does the term naturalist mean? 

Those who hope for any help from etymology will be disappointed. The word nature comes to us from Latin natura. The Greek correlate is physis, which means roughly “that which grows”.  % Homer’s Odyssey says “ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοιφύσιν αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε.” (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature.) Odyssey 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray).

Aristotle distinguishes nature from art by nature having in itself the source of motion while art has its source of motion from without. The Oxford English Dictionary lists a bafflingly wide range of entries on the term nature.  The major supergroups are senses relating either to “bodily strength” or “mental or physical impulses” or “innate character.” Examples include sexual urges of an animal, the character of a human, essential qualities of anything, including God. A sermon from 17th century preacher Robert South on Job urges that “God would not act sutably, and congruously, to the Equity and Goodness of his Nature, if He should not reward it.”   (OED)  %”nature, n.". OED Online. December 2014. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/125353?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=TLHvuY&amp; (accessed March 06, 2015). 

John McDowell describes himself as a naturalist by which he means to avoid the “fear of supernaturalism”[% @mcdowell.mw 84] 

McDowell would find it strange to hear from Reverend South a discussion of the nature of God called a naturalistic discussion, but it is hard to see how McDowell or anyone can block such usages of the term except by excluding them by definition.

###A quick example of non-overlapping sets of definitions for overlapping sets of terms
Keywords: Nature, Practical Reason, Human, Science, Goodness. Humans are part of nature, and so is goodness, and it can be known by science.

Compare these two statements: 

1. Humans are merely wetware meat machines, and goodness is whatever property conduces to our biological flourishing and genotype reproductive success, and such properties can be discovered, categorized, and exhaustively researched by physical, biological, psychological, and sociological sciences.

OR

2. Humans are one of the entities in existence, and so is the form of good, which can be known, and goodness is whatever participates in the Good, which for us is the flourishing of our rational nature, which can be known and taught through tradition, including metaphysics, psychology, ethical inquiry, revelation, and experience.

Both deploy the keywords above systematically. But the interlocking system of meanings of each term individually together in these sentences is different. The metaethical frameworks deploying these keywords might seem incommensurable. I don't think they are. Two consistent systems can be judged relative to eachother by picking out one or two particular claims each makes and discerning which seems most likely to be true. The "winner" of that judgment points us to the system in which it is embedded. 


##Democritus and Lucretius
While this dissertation’s main interlocutors are contemporary, it helps to include some older friends and foes in the conversation. Considering the historical context of a debate is often useful, sometimes irrelevant, but never harmful. However abstract, timeless, and almost mathematical the arguments for and against a proposition, it sometimes helps to know who has defended and attacked it before, how they have done so, and what other truth-claims and behavioral maxims are organically related to that proposition. 

For this reason, I begin my literature review not with G. E. Moore but with Democritus. 

The theorizing of Democritus is important for my purposes in two ways: his end (continuity) and his means (matter). (1) He desired an account that afforded radical continuity of explanation. And (2) his account found that continuity in material objects. 

##Lucretius
Lucretius puts the lie to the whole notion that modern materialism, or contemporary physicalism, is a recent discovery and a sort of philosophical upshot of the modern scientific revolution.</Text>

            <Text>### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

For MacIntyre, moral enquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such enquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. </Text>

            <Title>### Modernity is Hopeless without Telos</Title>
            <Text>### Assumption 1: We all have a tradition ###

One might question whether “we” (Anglo-American westerners) inhabit a “tradition” at all. But MacIntyre points out that we do. It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives” in the popular sense.) For simplicity, I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ in most instances to describe this tradition. 

What is a tradition? An extended, socially-embedded argument deriving from a source text and continuing across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). 

Modernity is a political movement. That is, modernity is a global human phenomenon, for it began with scientific, religious, and political shifts in Europe and caused cultural and intellectual shifts and furthered seismic shifts in science, religion, and politics. Even so, politics is perhaps the clearest marker of modernity; rise of the modern state is perhaps the greatest sign of modernity’s conquest of the western mind, heart, and imagination. As evidence of this suggestion, we can remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Hence, MacIntyre’s critique of modernity has political as well as social and ethical aspects. 

### Modernity is hopeless ###


Throughout MacIntyre’s oeuvre, his abiding conviction is that something is terribly wrong with modernity and it needs restorative resources from outside itself. I would like to briefly present an outline of this critique. It will make more intelligible the virtue theory to come. 

From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] But rather than embracing a thorough, cynical, postmodern sort of nihilism, however, MacIntyre (perhaps surprisingly) discovered an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue, and eventually Thomism, that MacIntyre continues to build. 

MacIntyre compared modern moral discourse to catastrophe, where only fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive in states of increasing decay. He says: 
&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

But the catastrophe did not affect only academic disciplines. It affects human culture. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the appearance of having a dialectical case for their value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any normative point you can think of (the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation), but they also disagree on normative frameworks (deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism), and on metaethical points (moral realism, moral epistemology, moral semantics), and more. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreeing on the formal and material propositions under dispute. The apparent impossibility of settling moral disagreements over weighty primary normative issues, like abortion, sexual ethics, torture, war, the proper uses of technology has become the defining datum of modern reflection on morality and ethics. 

Rather than despair, MacIntyre noticed that similar disagreement has marked discussions in the natural sciences. This observation proved extremely fruitful. 

Briefly, Thomas Kuhn’s watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* challenges the widespread naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquires has been growing, steadily, in a straight line, since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. The paradigm is a research program around which many can unite as well as a stable scientific system of doctrine that can be added to or pruned. But lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm, once revolutionary, becomes the stable scientific system of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyerabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call it MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] But Kuhn and Feyerabend ended in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology, a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. MacIntyre ended in a thoroughgoing, optimistic, progressive, anti-relativistic Thomism. 

This parallel explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. It is extremely cognizant of history; it is obsessed with methodology and epistemology. So is philosophy of science. 

This comparison between ethical crises and scientific crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. </Text>

Michael Rea, World Without Design: The Ontological Consequences of Naturalism. Oxford. 2002. 
Overview:
According to Troy Cross’s review in the Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, Rea’s argument is that naturalism is committed to substance dualism, antirealism about material objects, skepticism about other minds, and the suspension of judgment about idealism” but that supernaturalism is not committed to these. 

“Trouble begins with what Rea calls, the “discovery problem,” which “is just the fact that intrinsic modal properties seem to be undiscoverable by the methods of the natural sciences” (77). Our ordinary beliefs about material objects carry modal commitments. A statute, for instance, cannot survive smashing, but a lump of clay can. Such persistence conditions are integral to our very concepts of material objects. But how can a naturalist account for our knowledge of these modal properties?”

            <Title>Mackie, The Subjectivity of Values</Title>
            <Text>## Metaethics


Reasons, desires, and obligations. These are hooked up. There are necessary connections. THey might all be hooked up, only some of them, one way or both way. 

Humeans think you have to have desire present to motivated by reason. 

*Internalists*
The reason itself motivates you. 

*Externalists*
Deny that reasons and desires are logically connected. 
Weak and strong versions. 

Mackie's first pass at objective values are not just hypothetically imperative. If you lack the desire, the movition, then you lack the obligation. That's the internalist danger. 
If you don't have the desire, then you don't have the reason. 
That's a bad thing about internalism -- if you lack the desire, you lack the obligation. THere are lots of internalist. 

Korsgaard is an internalist. Michael Smith is internalist. 
David Brink is a famous externalist. 

Mackie says reasons have to link up with motivations. Then he says "action-directing". Now I have a reason that actually has to direct my action. 

Two versions of internalism:
*weaker* -- reasons motivate you. It's a necessary part of the concept of a reason. It's hooked up with motivation. May not issue in action.  (Korsgaard)
*stronger* -- reasons action-guide you. It's a necessary part of the concept of reason. Has to issue in action. 

There's no dictionary definition. It all depends on the stipulative definitions. It's hard to solve the debate without showing how it all plays out.
Internalism exempts people from morality. That's a bad result. People like Harmon believes that. There's nothing you can say to those people. I don't see anything wrong with them. There's nothing you can see. Reasons/obligations hook up with desires.

"Action-directing absolutely" moral bindingness -- Superson wrote about that has to get it accepted. What makes a reason take with you? They talk about this compellingness. You can't help but accept them.

People read Kant as an internalist. If you recognize you have a moral reason, then you will act on. There are many things written on internalism. Read for a starting paper: 1958 Frankena, Internalism and Externalism. 

Objective value might be the notion of "wrong itself"? (17)

Bottom of (17)… objective values have “fictitious external authority”… authority is closer to bindingness. 

The only way we know them is through intuition. Kant is going to say no. How do I know these categorical imperatives? It’s contradictions in reasoning. If I can’t universalize a principle, and can only apply it to myself… there’s a contradiction in my desires. 

Keith: epistemic reasons are binding. 
Anita: Don’t know what to say. I don’t do epistemology. The thing internalism and externalism in epistemology is different from ethics. What about legal reasons? Are they hooked up to motives? Do they issue in actions? There’s an analogy here. If you’re a strong internist, reasons necessarily direct us to act, cause us to act. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, you must not … Compare moral reasons to practical reasons; legal reasons; reasons of aesthetics; etiquette;  you put the fork on one side, spoon on one side. Are they just as special and queer? 
Kosgaard is going to say — that if you don’t have motivations then you’re irrational. Chapter 6 of the moral skeptic lays out the views, argues against internalism, and for weak externalism. For every person working on it there’s a different definition working on it. Complicated. Hard to argue for or against it. Seems intuitive, intuitions go one way or another. Have to ask what turns on this? What happens to the theory? </Text>

            <Title>Arthur Balfour and Lloyd Morgan</Title>
            <Text>##Arthur Balfour and Lloyd Morgan

About the same time that G. E. Moore was busy inventing analytic metaethics, the British philosopher and politician Arthur Balfour was composing a fascinating monograph called *Theism and Humanism.* Arthur Balfour’s *Theism and Humanism* develops an argument from naturalism against naturalism that runs as follows: 

&gt;[There is] no distinction to be drawn between the development of reason and that of any other faculty, physiological or psychical, by which the interests of the individual or the race are promoted. From the humblest form of nervous irritation at the one end of the scale, to the reasoning capacity of the most advanced races at the other, everything without exception (sensation, instinct, desire, volition) has been produced directly or indirectly, by natural causes acting for the most part on strictly utilitarian principles. Convenience, not knowledge, therefore, has been the main end to which this process has tended.[@balfour 68].

And again: 
&gt;Taking naturalism as our guiding principle we can hardly doubt that the august sentiments which cling to the ideas of duty and sacrifice are nothing better than a device of nature to trick us into the performance of altruistic actions.[@balfour 15]

In my own words: 
any conclusion is false if the conclusion of the argument contradicts the objective truth-finding ability of the very faculty of reason by which we gathered the premises in favor of the conclusion.  
Let A be the proposition that: reason is a truth-finding faculty that is at least occasionally reliable at discovering true propositions. 
Let B be the proposition that: Natural selection is responsible for the state of the current state of the brain, its functions, abilities, etc. 
And let C be the proposition that: Natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties. 

1. If A then B.
2. If B then C.
3. A. 
3. B.
4. Therefore C. 
5. If C, then not-A. 
6. Not-A. 

1. The brain exhibits truth-finding properties, then we can learn that natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties. 
2. If natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties only,  4. natural selection is entirely responsible for the brain's functioning, 
3. The brain exhibits truth-finding properties
4. natural selection is entirely responsible for the brain's functioning, 
If natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties only, then the brain does not exhibit truth-finding properties. 
5. The brain does not exhibit truth-finding properties. 



This argument type is picked up by a philosophical if popular journalist (G. K. Chesterton in *Orthodoxy*), a philosophical and literary scholar (C. S. Lewis in *Miracles*), and contemporary philosophers (Alvin Plantinga in *Where the Conflict Really Lies*, and Thomas Nagel in *Mind and Cosmos*). 

The problem with the argument is not only that it contains a contradiction (that is bad enough). The problem is also that it undermines *all truth claims* including, of course, the truth claims that lead us to believe in things like natural selection. 

Lloyd Morgan’s review of Balfour’s book calls it “one of the most remarkable books of modern times.”[@morgan] Yet he differs from Balfour’s conclusions on almost every point. His responses are instructive. Morgan sees that natural selection produce humans, but that humans and rationality have advanced beyond the initial state produced. Natural selection, we might say, is only the indirect producer of human rationality, ethical ideals, and so on. 

Furthermore, naturalism is not opposed to supernaturalism. “[W]e are far from denying the existence or the all-pervading influence of the supernatural ; nay, rather we are laying firmly the foundations of a belief based not on rationalism, but on idealism. We contend for the natural and intrinsic nobility of man at his best and highest, and see therein the foundations of his religious ideals.”[@morgan 84] Morgan does not flesh out these contentions much. But he somehow sees in naturalism not a refutation of “supernaturalism” or idealism but a basis for it. 

Morgan’s naturalism is simply a method of sticking “close to the realities that are given in practical experience; and to remember that every step in analysis takes us so much further from the reality from which we start.”[@morgan 86] By this light, the physicist who says a tree in the next field is “nothing but matter and energy” and the psychologist who says the tree is “nothing but sensations ... combined” may both be right but there is also a tree in the next field. The bottom line is that the “criterion of reality” is “direct experience” rather than “that which remains after the most ... rigorous analysis” [@morgan 88]. Morgan affirms both sides of the objective/subjective divide, whether the results of intense experimental study or intense introspective analysis, since “nothing ... can be more real than a bit of practical experience in the moment of that experience; and if in analysis we distinguish therein an objective aspect on the one hand and a subjective aspect on the other hand, let us remember that these two are of strictly co-ordinate reality.”[@morgan 89]</Text>

## Section 2 &amp; 3: Objections and Replies ##


### Section Introduction ###

MacIntyre's work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. 

On the one hand, defenders of what MacIntyre lumps together as "modernity" or "modern liberalism" object to the historical narrative by which they (all!) get somehow lumped together by a single (quite despairing) diagnosis of unintelligibility. 

On the other hand, even critics of modernity who accept his diagnosis might dispute the prognosis. For example, even Thomists such as Robert P. George and John Haldane with whom he ostensibly shares a philosophical school dispute his Thomism. (Since I am not a Thomist and do not have a dog in that fight, I shall not dig deeply into these worries.)

By far the largest group of professional philosophers belong to one or the other of the two remaining rival versions of moral enquiry. And professional philosophers, of which he is a quite successful, may be tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy. (I treat 'success' here as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) "A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."[@hauerwas2007]

The three rival versions of moral enquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. But "Encyclopedists" dispute his historicism and the implied relativism of ethical theory. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, non-perspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality. 

Another critique comes from quite opposite quarters. The genealogist, the postmodern philosopher, the Nietzschean pessimist accepts MacIntyre’s critique of modernity but critique his project of *restoring* modernity via the tradition of Aristotle, virtue, and Thomas Aquinas.  The encyclopedist, the modern philosopher, the rationalist optimist denies MacIntyre’s alpha and accepts his omega; these skeptics accept MacIntyre’s alpha but deny his omega. Tradition and history rule all, and there is no escaping their tyranny. But MacIntyre thinks that just because we are born into the tyrannical kingdom doesn’t mean we can never leave. 

And (somewhat ironically) relativists like Gilbert Harman reject his moral realism. These think that his emphasis on traditions is well-taken, and that he should not therefore try to extricate any universal moral truths. 

"Genealogists" and postmodern philosophers agree with his critique of liberalism but reject his solution. They agree that our choice is between Nietzsche or Aristotle but choose Nietzsche over Aristotle. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

But I think to concede this is to give up on ethics as philosophy -- and perhaps to give up on philosophy as a whole. If it were true, I would have to stop writing now. 

The encyclopedist thinks we are born free. The genealogist thinks we are born slaves. MacIntyre thinks we are born slaves but we can get free. 

It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

I shall divide them into critiques from modernity and from postmodernity. These are very different critiques! 

For those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are “historically extended arguments."

### Section Outline ##

In the following sub-sections, I articulate and discuss key objections to MacIntyre’s philosophical ethics, especially his accounts of virtue and practice, of tradition-constituted rationality, and of teleology and happiness,

While I agree with much of MacIntyre’s picture of the development of western civilization, there is far more in his proposals than I can comment on, let alone defend. Instead, I’ll surface and discuss a few particular objections. 

The primary objection regarding virtue as he defines it relative to practices, the narrative of human life, and tradition, is the charge of relativism. This is a weighty objection and deserves almost a whole chapter in its own right. 

A related objection regarding tradition-constituted rationality charges MacIntyre with an incoherent definition of tradition; if some traditions are truly incommensurable to each other, and MacIntyre himself is truly situated within a tradition, then writing a book like *After Virtue* which is written from a universal, objective, view-from-nowhere should be impossible. Writing *After Virtue* and defending a theory of virtue amounts to a performative contradiction. 

The third objection regarding teleology and the “quest” for human happiness or fulfillment is twofold: on the one hand, it seems that modern moral philosophy can get along quite well without teleology. On the other hand, even if it couldn’t, then that seems to indict philosophical ethics entirely as unscientific, hopeless, superstition. 

I summarize the secondary literature on these points, as well as MacIntyre’s replies, and attempt to adjudicate the conflict. 

Finally, I shall close with a reflection on why his philosophical ethics is so infuriating and liable to misunderstanding. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. </Text>

G.E. Moore is well known as a non-naturalist. He is less widely-known as a consequentialist. My thesis combines metaethical realism with virtue theory and so includes but does not limit itself to consequentialist theses. Consequentialism is opposed to virtue theory, but not diametrically opposed. 


## Contemporary Naturalism of a Paradigmatic Sort
Contemporary naturalism follows Democritus and Lucretius on the two main points, the end goal and the means thereto.

According to David Papineau, naturalism is not just a banner under which to gather or a vacuous slogan like “world peace!” Alyssa Ney argues that naturalism is not a truth claim with propositional content but an oath or a vow to follow science wherever it leads. In this sense, I am a naturalist. According to Alvin Plantinga, naturalism is simply atheism plus. In this sense, I am not a naturalist. When avowing a term requires appending a series of checkboxes detailing what one does and doesn’t mean by the term, it seems high time to either rethink or retire the term.</Text>

            <Text>It is no wonder that ancient Greek values like affections like patriotism, friendship, and family love are less regarded or less philosophically analyzed. For civic loyalty, love of friends, and love of one’s own family are *partial*, that is, *not impartial.* Bernard Williams underscores this point: the good person’s motivation to save one’s spouse from drowning is not an additional thought that “after all, it is permissible to help one’s spouses.” The motivation to help is simply “this is my spouse!” The same kind of partiality we associate with admirable people goes for friendship and national or civic loyalty. “This is my city, therefore I ought to defend it against unjust laws or marauding conquerers.”</Text>

II. Summary 
(Write first)

	1.	Mackie argues the thesis that “there are no objective values” (13). Values like goodness, rightness, wrongness, and also beauty or ugliness are “not part of the fabric of the world” (13). The ontological part of this thesis is that such values do not exist. The epistemological part is that, even if they did, we would not know them. 
	2.	He calls this conclusion “moral skepticism” but distinguishes it from other varieties of moral skepticism.  One kind of moral skeptic rejects conventional morality or his own society’s morality but endorses another modified morality or alternative set of putatively objective values (13). Another kind of moral skeptic might even accept conventional morality (as a fiction, say) but deny that morality is about anything “out there” in the world. 
	3.	Mackie distinguishes various meanings of “subjectivism”, a view in the vicinity of his own. If objective values do not exist, then we might naturally wonder how and why moral language functions the way it does, assuming the intelligibility of objective values. 
	4.	After explaining just what sort of subjectivism he intends to refer to, and some of the assumptions and implications of his thesis, he argues for his thesis. 
	5.	The moral skepticism thesis that there are no objective values he supports with two considerations: the absence of moral values is the best explanation of “moral relativity” (or moral disagreement) and objective values, if they existed, would be objectionable queer. By queer, of course, he means, weird, unique, unprecedented, unusual, sui generis, strange, baffling, mysterious, opaque, and so on. 
	6.	The argument from relativity or disagreement is this: moral codes vary between societies at a time and within a society across time. One society endorses polygamy, another condemns it; one society endorses human sacrifice, another condemns it; one endorses revenge killing, another condemns it. An explanation of the wide variation and instability of these endorsements and condemnations, as well as the accompanying attitudes of approval, disgust, honor, is that there are no objective values at work. The moral code of a society is not a map of what is “really” morally lawful, but a map of that societies attitudes, endorsements, and condemnations.
	7.	A reply to the argument from relativity. There is another explanation, that varying moral codes “express perceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly distorted, of objective values” (18). People and societies vary on evaluative matters in the same way and for the same reason that people and societies vary on scientific, historical, legal, and other matters.
	8.	But this reply is, Mackie thinks, false. The disagreements between people and societies — the varieties of moral codes — is similar to scientific or historical disagreements. Scientific disagreements arise between people offering different “speculative inferences or explanatory hypotheses based on inadequate evidence” (18). I think Mackie is suggesting that two people might dispute a particular point (is Pluto a planet? Is this the tooth of a dinosaur or platypus?) because neither of them has fully accurate knowledge and both are doing the best they can with the available evidence, though future evidence may be forthcoming. 
	9.	Mackie is seriously misguided here. That there is disagreement between people and societies and variation between moral codes is not good reason to be skeptical about moral values; it is rather good reason to think values are indeed objective. 
	10.	Moral disagreement is not good reason to be skeptical about the objectivity moral values because such disagreement is saliently identical to scientific and philosophical disagreement; and scientific and philosophical disagreements are not good reason to be skeptical about scientific realism or optimistic engagement in philosophical dialectic. Some scientific disputes will probably never be resolved with reference to new empirical data — what happened seconds before the Big Bang? What is the necessary and sufficient condition for a discipline to be considered a science? — And certainly some philosophical disputes certainly will never be resolved by adequate empirical evidence. Is idealism or empiricism or rationalism true, or something else? The persistence of idealists, rationalists, empiricists etc., for the last 2000 years (at least) shows that such disputes are ongoing and not likely to be resolved. If that idealogical disagreement is evidence that there is no fact of the matter — no objective truth — then perhaps Mackie can use moral disagreement as evidence that there is no objective value. But if he thinks, say, idealism is false and empiricism true, despite the existence of people and schools of thought who mistakenly hold that idealism is true, then he ought to think also that (say) those who hold Moral Code A are getting the objective values accurately, while those who hold Moral Code B are mistaken. 
	11.	A second objection to the argument from relativity Mackie considers: some moral principles — very broad principles — are universally recognized: it is good to promote the general happiness. 
	12.	Mackie counters with the puzzling complaint that arguing that broad, elevated moral principles  are objective entails that specific, practical moral principles are contingent — “if things had been otherwise, quite different sorts of actions would have been right” (19). This complaint has the tone of voice and flavor of a counter without the substance. It is eminently true that “if things had been otherwise, quite different sorts of actions would have been right” — if for instance humans could breath underwater, then waterboarding would not be wrong because it would not be torturous and therefore cruel. If Bob’s society was communist then amassing capital for his own personal use would be selfish and illegal and therefore antisocial. These counterfactuals are just what we would predict if general moral principles reflected universal, objective values. 
	13.	A final reply to the objection to the argument from relativity that some broader moral codes are universal: Mackie suggests that most people’s moral lives and moral judgments do not actually operate according to specification of “general principles.” Rather, people seem to make moral judgments and live their moral lives according to certain “immediate responses” and “basic moral judgments”. 
	14.	Thankfully, Mackie does not spend too much time elaborating on this paper thin reply and moves on to the argument from queerness. We can reflect on our own moral judgments for a moment to explore what it might mean that we often make moral judgments as immediate aroused responses. For example, perhaps we hear a news story about a woman beating, scalding, suffocating, and finally murdering her children before storing their corpses in a freezer. [http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/06/29/detroit-mom-back-in-court-in-freezer-bodies-case/29454321/  
	16.	That immediately strikes me as cruel, sick, degraded, disgusting, and wrong. It “arouses” disgust in me immediately. Whether this response is the logical extension of a moral principle I reflectively endorse (such as “parents should care for their children” or “cruelty is wrong”) or merely a pre-reflectively, visceral attitude is irrelevant to whether the moral judgment accurately reflects the objective value of parental love. 
	17.	Mackie might have focussed more on moral codes that are transcultural and span all known historical periods: for example, the universal prohibition on incestuous relationships, the blame of immoderation (drunkenness or alcoholism are condemned in every society in the world), the praise of justice and compassion, specifically caring for the poor, widows, and orphans. These are not “general” principles but rather specific, and universally agreed upon, transcultural moral codes that are best explained as expressions of objective value. 
	18.	The famed argument from queerness Mackie calls “even more important… and certainly more generally applicable.” It has a metaphysical and epistemological part. 
	19.	The argument from queerness builds on the sense that “if there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe” (19). Objective values would be esoterica, akin to non-natural qualities, Plato’s transcendent Form of Good, or like divine commands from heaven, they would be authoritatively prescriptive, empirically unverifiable. We could be as poetic as possible to make the descriptive seem mundane and the prescriptive seem unspeakably mystical. 
	20.	A reply to the argument from queerness: perhaps objective values are strange (in that they are not like descriptive facts) but they are not so strange (in that they are like essences, numbers, substances, necessity and possibility, causation, etc.). 
	21.	But Mackie thinks this reply would be ultimately impotent if we could show (and he does not try to show) that we can “on empiricist foundations…we construct an account o the ideas and beliefs and knowledge that we have of all these matters” (19). So the success of this objection, that objective values are not saliently different from other unobjectionable abstract entities or concepts like necessity or causation depends on the details. Terence Cuneo, David Enoch, and Russ Shafer-Landau have provided these details and shown (though I shall not try to show it here) that indeed objective values are not any more objectionable than other kinds of abstract objects. 
	22.	The epistemological part of the argument from queerness is that </Text>

ABSTRACT
This book offers a systematic, comprehensive framework for thinking about the moral evaluation of character. Many recent attempts to stake out a place in moral philosophy for this concern define virtue in terms of its benefits for the virtuous person or for human society more generally. Part One of this book presents and defends a conception of virtue as intrinsic excellence of character, worth prizing for its own sake and not only for its benefits. The other two parts address two challenges to the ancient idea of excellence of character. One challenge arises from the importance of altruism in modern ethical thought, and the question of what altruism has to do with intrinsic excellence. Part Two argues that altruistic benevolence has indeed a crucial place in excellence of character, but that moral virtue should also be expected to involve excellence in being for other goods besides the well-being (and the rights) of other persons. It explores relations among cultural goods, personal relationships, one's own good, and the good of others, as objects of excellent motives. The other challenge is typified by doubts about the reality of moral virtue, arising from experiments and conclusions in social psychology. Part Three of the book explores in detail the prospects for an empirically realistic conception of excellence of character as an object of moral aspiration, endeavour, and education. It argues that such a conception will involve renunciation of the ancient thesis of the unity or mutual implication of all virtues, and acknowledgement of sufficient ‘moral luck’ in the development of any individual's character to make virtue very largely a gift, rather than an individual achievement, though nonetheless excellent and admirable for that.
Keywords: character, moral luck, altruism, goods, unity of virtues, virtues, well-being, excellence

Robert Merrihew Adams
*A Theory of Virtue*

Chapter 4: 
&gt;The principal current alternative to defining virtue in terms of its intrinsic excellence is defining it in terms of its benefits. This chapter argues that a trait's being generally beneficial is not sufficient for it to be a virtue, and that its being more beneficial than any alternative may not even be necessary for a trait to be a virtue. In response to the question whether virtue ‘pays’, reliably benefiting its possessor, it is suggested that virtue may offer a great benefit that is inseparable from having a strong motive for conscientious and generous action.
This gives the lie to any ethical naturalism that defines flourishing as a kind of good in itself and virtues as contributing to that flourishing. Virtues themselves are intrinsic excellences.

From Ben Bradley’s review on Notre Dame. https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25302-a-theory-of-virtue-excellence-in-being-for-the-good/

The centerpiece of Adams's book, naturally, is his theory of virtue, according to which virtue is excellence in being for the good.  To "be for" the good is to be disposed to favor it in "action, desire, emotion or feeling" (p. 17).  Adams is a pluralist about the good; the goods that virtue is for include members of several ontological categories, including states of affairs, people, and beautiful objects (p. 22).  Since one can be for the good for the wrong reasons, virtue requires excellence in being for the good.  For example, one who pursues the good for selfish reasons fails to exemplify excellence in being for the good (p. 23), even if that selfishness leads to good results.  An excellence is intrinsically good, not merely instrumentally good; it is "worthy to be honored, loved, admired, or (in the extreme case) worshiped, for its own sake" (p. 24).  Adams is unambitious about providing guidance about what counts as an excellence; he says his view "does not provide an algorithm for virtue" (p. 26).  Judgments of excellence "must rely to a considerable extent on moral perceptiveness" and are "to some extent intuitionistic" (p. 26).

Adams's view is similar to the view put forward by Thomas Hurka in Virtue, Vice and Value.  Hurka claims that virtues are intrinsically good attitudes towards intrinsic goods.  The primary way in which Hurka's view differs from Adams's is that according to Hurka, how virtuous it is to love a particular good depends on the match between the degree of love and the degree of goodness.  If one good is better than the other, the virtuous person loves it more.  Call this the proportionality thesis.  Adams's view is, essentially, Hurka's view with the proportionality thesis removed.

Can the virtues be unified or are they simply a list? 
	Adams says, No. They are a list of excellences, not unified in a single theory. 
	Slots makes a list of intrinsic goods: pleasure, knowledge, achievement — and defines virtue by appeal to attitudes to those goods (p.30 of Adams 2006). 

“His discussion of the relevance of situationist psychology to moral theory is thorough and convincing.  For these reasons, and because of the wide range of topics covered, reading Adams's book would be an excellent way for anyone to get up to speed on the current state of virtue theory.  It would make an outstanding text for a graduate seminar on virtue.” </Text>

            <Title>### MacIntyre's Audience </Title>
            <Text>### MacIntyre's Audience ###

MacIntyre's work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. 

On the one hand, defenders of what MacIntyre lumps together as "modernity" or "modern liberalism" object to the historical narrative by which they (all!) get somehow lumped together by a single (quite despairing) diagnosis of unintelligibility. 

On the other hand, even critics of modernity who accept his diagnosis might dispute the prognosis. For example, even Thomists such as Robert P. George and John Haldane with whom he ostensibly shares a philosophical school dispute his Thomism. (Since I am not a Thomist and do not have a dog in that fight, I shall not dig deeply into these worries.)

By far the largest group of professional philosophers belong to one or the other of the two remaining rival versions of moral inquiry. And professional philosophers, of which he is a quite successful, may be tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy. (I treat 'success' here as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) "A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."[@hauerwas2007]

The three rival versions of moral inquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. But "Encyclopedists" dispute his historicism and the implied relativism of ethical theory. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, non-perspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality. 

Another critique comes from quite opposite quarters. The genealogist, the postmodern philosopher, the Nietzschean pessimist accepts MacIntyre’s critique of modernity but critique his project of *restoring* modernity via the tradition of Aristotle, virtue, and Thomas Aquinas.  The encyclopedist, the modern philosopher, the rationalist optimist denies MacIntyre’s alpha and accepts his omega; these skeptics accept MacIntyre’s alpha but deny his omega. Tradition and history rule all, and there is no escaping their tyranny. But MacIntyre thinks that just because we are born into the tyrannical kingdom doesn’t mean we can never leave. 

And (somewhat ironically) relativists like Gilbert Harman reject his moral realism. These think that his emphasis on traditions is well-taken, and that he should not therefore try to extricate any universal moral truths. 

"Genealogists" and postmodern philosophers agree with his critique of liberalism but reject his solution. They agree that our choice is between Nietzsche or Aristotle but choose Nietzsche over Aristotle. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

But I think to concede this is to give up on ethics as philosophy -- and perhaps to give up on philosophy as a whole. If it were true, I would have to stop writing now. 

The encyclopedist thinks we are born free. The genealogist thinks we are born slaves. MacIntyre thinks we are born slaves but we can get free. 

It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

I shall divide them into critiques from modernity and from postmodernity. These are very different critiques! 

For those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are “historically extended arguments."</Text>

# Chapter 1: Introduction, Flow of Arguments

### Draft 1
This dissertation defense the thesis that human virtue and human values are not part of nature in the same way that nonhuman rocks and trees and animal brains are part of nature. 

If this thesis is right then either anti-realism is true or non-naturalism is true, but ethical naturalisms (of the extant variety) are unlikely to be true. I assume that anti-realism is false until the final chapter, in which I provide a few brief reasons to think the assumption is true. Non-naturalism I argue to be the most likely true explanation for our understanding of human value and virtue. 

* In chapter 1 outline the keywords and key premises and propositions pertaining to this thesis, especially naturalism, non-naturalism in the context of the debate about values like goodness and beauty and virtues like justice, courage, or contentment. 
* In chapter 2, I discuss the historical background of this debate from Democritus and Aristotle through G. E. Moore, Arthur Balfour, and turn of the 21st century. 
* In chapter 3, I critically appraise reductive ethical naturalism as articulated and defended by Richard Boyd, Frank Jackson, Nicholas Sturgeon and others. 
* In chapter 4, I critically appraise non-reductive ethical naturalism as articulated and defended by Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, and others.
* In chapter 5, I critically appraise neo-Aristotelian naturalism, as articulated and defended by John McDowell, Philippa Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Stephen Brown. 
* In chapter 6, I further explain and defend my own view of morally realist virtue theory in relation to ethical non-naturalism. 

### Draft 2

This dissertation defense the thesis that virtue theory is the ethical framework with the most plausibility but that it is incompatible with the type of naturalism that is in 2014 is touted by 49 percent of analytic philosophers. The corollary of this thesis is that either virtue theory or such naturalism must be rejected. 

There are three kinds of people that might be interested in the arguments in favor of this thesis and against it, besides those who are generally is interested in ethics and meta-ethics. The first is philosophical naturalists who are on the hunt for a theory of morality that both takes morality seriously and rounds values and virtues and human happiness in nature. The second is those supernaturalists who are interested in arguments for virtue theory and wondered whether virtue theory is somehow aligned with a supernatural metaphysics. The third are virtue as assistants who might be wondering how their distinctly ethical theorizing connects with various broadly metaphysical frameworks.

### Draft 3

This dissertation defends the thesis that human virtue cannot be naturalized but that virtue talk is the best (most practically useful and theoretically plausible) kind of ethical theory we have. In this way, my  metaethical account that can be described as morally realist, non-naturalistic virtue ethics. 

There are two kinds of reasons to disbelieve my thesis. The first is allegedly more plausible alternative theories (or anti-theories) of morality: deontology, utilitarianism, moral nihilism of various stripes. The second is objections to my thesis. I shalI respond to each reason. But my responses will not be symmetrical. Regarding the first reason, evaluating the global persuasiveness and plausibility of a single ethical theory as a whole is hard work for one book, let alone all rivals to virtue ethics. So I shall content myself with identifying which plausibility points won by each side if it can explain a few, common, core judgments or values, like that friendship is a good thing, that is laudable to love and wonderful to be loved, and common assessments we make of admirable people. Regarding the second reason, I shall surface as many objections as I can find in the literature, learn from colleagues, and think up myself. I shall polish them up as well as possible and articulate them as sympathetically as possible and then, of course, do the hard work of refuting them as well as possible. 

My primary thesis is directed at those who already accept or lean toward virtue theory in general. For those, the reasons to accept virtue theory are redundant; for others, my reasons here to accept virtue theory are liable to be more tantalizing than persuasive. I shall point to the writings of a diverse group of virtue theorists— like Rosalind Hursthouse, Julia Annas, and John McDowell — who are different from each other in many ways but united about virtue. 

The question within virtue theory that I want to answer is this: can virtue theory be plausibly naturalistic? Are notions of virtue, happiness, flourishing, and notions of physicalism, naturalized epistemology and so on incompatible? Is neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism either Aristotelian or ethically naturalistic, but not both? I shall argue that they are incompatible. For many of naturalist orientation, this will decrease the global plausibility of virtue ethics. If the notions of virtue, along with honor, chastity, and slavery, are relics of the past, so much the worse for them. Naturalism is the philosophy of the future, for science is the philosophy of the future. But we cannot be too sanguine here. 

My secondary thesis is directed to just those who are undecided about virtue theory or already committed to one of it’s rivals. The global plausibility of virtue theory in light of a reasonable view of cosmology, politics, and psychology is very high indeed, as others before me have shown. But the global plausibility of naturalism is very high, as well. The tension between the two, if there is any tension, is cause for intellectual concern. Some naturalists have argued that the only alternative to moral realism is moral nihilism, which is such an unattractive position th

In order to make all of this tolerably clear, I shall have to define ‘naturalism.’ This is no easy task, and takes up a good bit of space in the chapter x. Naturalism we might call a movement. The momentum it has built, starting nearly 500 years ago, has crested and reached a kind of tipping point. Either naturalism will fulfill its promise of naturalizing not just the cosmos but everything else including mind and value, or naturalism will begin to ebb. Either the naturalists who have been hopeful of the research program in philosophy and outside it will make good on the last remaining pesky puzzles, or, to the astonishment of many, naturalism will prove to be not just incapable at the moment but incapable in principle of developing a comprehensive and satisfying account of both the cosmos and the mind.

This dissertation defends the thesis that virtue is a gift of God. As Plato suggested in Meno, the source of human virtue is not humanity or nature but something outside both humanity and nature. This thesis must be distinguished from a thesis in the vicinity — a thesis much debated in popular forums — about whether one can be “good without God.” I think this is like asking whether a gardener can grow plants without the sun. The answer is the gardener needs sunlight but need not believe in the sun to grow plants. Similarly, if virtue is a gift from God, then the virtuous person needs help but need not believe in the Helper to live virtuously and benefit others. 


###Draft 5

This dissertation advances the thesis that all extant ethical naturalisms are false. The corollaries of this thesis are that we must either elect for ethical non-naturalistic virtue and do so very soon, or else wait perhaps a long time some yet-to-be-defined articulation or yet-to-be-conceived conception of ethical naturalism. 

Chapter 1 reviews some of the primary discussions and attempts plausible definitions of some what are called ‘Keywords’ in the debate between naturalists and non-naturalists over ethics, including ‘nature, ‘good,’ ‘virtue’, and ‘human’, ‘practical reason,’ ‘telos,’ and ‘science’. 

Chapter 2 advances a positive version of virtue ethical theory that provides strong explanatory power over a range of moral platitudes, namely, entrenched folk moral views that seem so right, and why some sophisticated moral theories seem so wrong. Family is important. Friendship is valuable. Cruelty is wrong. The question of whether this virtue theory is ‘naturalistic’ is deferred. And the motivation for a naturalistic theory of ethics is highlighted. Some criteria for what our ethical theory should account for are negotiable (say, that my ethical theory should explain why I am always right and others wrong) and, after reflection, ought to be given up. The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are: 

1. **Action** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport; norms are action-guiding; practical reason gives reasons for practice -- that is, rational action rather than static reason and irrational activity. explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons. 
2. **Character** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials.
3. **Diverse Finite Goods** — accounting for human evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest);
4. **Heroic Virtue **- accounting for how some exemplary good people become so good; 
5. **Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** —  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others;
6. **Diverse Normativity** — explaining the parity between epistemic and moral norms (in contrast to the absence of a parity between etiquette norms or preferences);

Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. 

Chapter X begins a critique of neo-Aristotelian naturalisms.  Aristotelian naturalism of a more phenomenological flavor proposed by Philippa Foot is critiqued. The  Aristotelian naturalism with a scientific flavor proposed by Stephen R. Brown is also examined. The problem of the fact value dichotomy is not overcome by asserting that some of human biology sets normative limits for human flourishing, happiness, and virtue. To speak adequately of all of human flourishing requires speaking of our rational nature and our biology as a union. The metaphysical problem with virtues being my virtues if personal identity has no further grounding than biology is urged. 

Chapter x critiques the “third alternative” between supernaturalism and reductive naturalism as espoused by Rosalind Hursthouse and John McDowell. The third way is a kind of groundless intersubjectivism wherein no further grounding is required, a non-transcendental idealism that avoids the myth of givenness (that some empirical truths come for free without any interference from our intellect) and the myth of objectivity (that some intellectual truths come for free without any help from our senses). The problem of moral nihilism rears its head. 

Chapter x rehearses criticism of various ethical naturalisms, beginning with non-cognitivist naturalism. If virtue ethical moral realism demands supernaturalism, then perhaps it is better to deny realism in general. But non-cognitivism (except expressivism) collapse into moral nihilism, which is not only implausible, but in light of primary, substantive normative and moral questions, morally reprehensible. Expressivism, albeit much more sophisticated and hard to exactly critique, collapses into a kind of ethical skepticism or nihilism that is inconsistent especially with Criterion 4. 

Chapter x critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the non-scientific flavor, where the good (say) is an ethical/natural property saliently different from other kinds of natural properties. It then critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the scientific flavor, where the good and other values are ethical/natural properties not saliently different from other natural properties like natural kinds. These fail to account for Criterion 3 and 4. 

Chapter x answers a few remaining objections, and considers whether (if no satisfying theory of ethical naturalism currently exists) it would be better to trust naturalism and wait for an ethical theory some day, or trust our ethical theory and abandon naturalism today, or very soon. In light of the ambiguity of the term naturalism, this final chapter concludes with some suggested re-conceptualizations of the five Keywords. 




### Draft 6

That we ought to love each other is true if anything is true. Life as lived is puzzling. Among the many puzzles that confront us, some of the most enduringly fun and bewildering are ethical puzzles about how we know what is good and whether there is a good at all.  These questions are given a special bite. 

This dissertation advances a naturalistic metaethical theory that combines moral realism and virtue theory. My thesis involves three claims: that nature consists of some normative facts and other facts in a radical continuity, that at least some those facts can be and in some cases are known, and that knowing and acting on them is (for rational creatures like us) the best way to live.

The question of naturalism will occupy much of our discussion. And it will take us into the *metaphysical* side of metaethical debates. I for one enjoy the variety of discussants and styles across philosophical metaphysicians and ethicists, but some may find the presence of so much metaphysical discussion strange alongside so much ethical discussion. 

Normative ethical theories (about duty, virtue, pleasure, the divine will, etc.) are normally taken to be competing and non-trivially distinct from metaethical theories about what grounds duties, virtues, human pleasure, God's decrees, etc. This received wisdom is wise. And yet, to paraphrase Thomas Nagel, sanity in our metaethics is most preserved by keeping primary ethical concerns near to our mind.

Explanations explain phenomena that puzzle us. There are, in many cases, competing explanations that can't both be true but that are both plausible. If I find a broken window in my home office and a stick on the ground, on the face it may be that some neighborhood menace was breaking windows for fun, or that my tree outside lost a branch in the wind. An explanation is (always?) underdetermined by the data. 
 
There are two ways to offer an explanation: as an argument (contending against others) or as a framework (aiming for consistency and coherency and plausibility). When offering the first kind of explanation qua argument it is necessary to attack other frameworks and defend one's own. When offering the second kind of explanation it is necessary to fully explicate the theory, drawing out aspects and clarifying or defending them. The plausibility of a framework then depends, for the reader, on how plausible and satisfying the framework is as a whole rather than the relatively less satisfying alternatives.

7. Objections, Clarifications, and Conclusions (What is Really Scientific)


There are two ways the reader might take my main claim: firstly, as a query about virtue ethics, whether it can be naturalistic or not; secondly, as a query about ethical naturalism, whether it can be made plausible or not. Admittedly these questions are distinct and can be treated separately. But insofar as writers like Hursthouse, Foot, and McDowell address them as a unity, I shall follow suit. 


My theses are these:

1. There exist some real primary norms (both epistemic and ethical) that are binding on us *qua* human beings. 
2.  These norms are in some cases, knowable and effable. 

Examples of such norms are 'proportion your belief to the evidence' and 'be kind to others.' 

If such norms are 'real' then they are mind-independent, true regardless of human opinion, etc. 

If they are 'binding on us qua human beings' then they truly prescribe over all creatures with practical rationality -- in other words, all creatures like us and all other potential creatures we might discover or be discovered by one day. 

I say 'some real norms' because, of course, not all norms are real. Norms of, say, spelling English words I take to be purely or mostly conventional. Drawing up lists of exactly which norms are real independent of human thought and which are human concepts is of course a difficult task. My task is simply to defend that the list of mind-independent norms has at least one item. 

The main rivals to the above theses are epistemic and moral nihilists, expressivists, and error theorists.  Some say such norms just don't exist except as concepts or social structures. Others say that if such norms existed they do not explain how we think and talk. So the arguments that such norms really exist are metanormative explanations of the way we talk, the way we act, and the we we (necessarily) think. 

But even among those who agree with the above theses are divided. Not everyone who agrees with the first two agree with each other. These norms seem to defy fact/value distinctions. They are evaluative facts, or factual prescriptions. At least, if they are "just values" then the fact/value gap becomes a problem. If they are fact-values then there is no gap to be overcome. But some philosophers become indignant at the notion of evaluative facts: what in the world could such strange things be? 

This leads to the question of whether ethical norms are 'natural'?  Are moral facts, or what I am calling simply 'norms' natural? This seems like a pressing and substantive question whose answer will affect alot. After doing the research for this dissertation, I no longer think it is a pressing or substantive question. It is not just vague but hopelessly vague; not just ambiguous but fatally ambiguous. 

4. Are these norms "natural"?
	* Are these norms radically anamolous? Are they strange, queer, discontinuous? 
	* Are such norms physical/material? (Nagel, McDowell)
	* Are such norms divine? 
5. Where do such norms come from? Do they happen to emerge from our biology? Do they come from the mouth of a god? Are they necessary features of our rational nature and other other creatures with a rational nature? 

My claim is that: 

1. These norms are 'natural' but that the question 'Is X natural?' is almost vacuous. 
	* These norms are not radically anomolous. They are not strange, queer, discontinous.  (Nagel)
	* These norms are not material. (Nagel, McDowell)
	* These norms are not emergent properties arising from our biology. (Foot, Brown)
5. These norms are internally related to human nature (via practical rationality). (Foot, McDowell, Kant)

For the purpose of these essays, I remain agnostic as to whether these norms come from any particular personal god. But I do claim that they are divine. The contrast is likely to strike the reader as strange. By 'divine' I mean that they transcend our animal biology and that conformity to them makes us rational, acting creatures full of wisdom and virtue.  Affirming the divinity of some norms is consonant with a variety of theistic views: Aristotle's god is neither Brahman nor Jehovah. 

But insofar as 'natualist' is just a label for 'atheist,' then my argument entails that naturalism is false. But I deny the charge that my view is "non-naturalistic." Insofar as 'naturalist' is a label for 'one who believes in the radical continuity of facts, the uniformity and harmony of reality,' I vehemently claim the label as my own. In order to claim the label as my own, I must show that they are mistaken who think reality is radically continuous because reality is fundamentally physical or material. 

The best evidence that reality is not fundamentally material is human nature, rationality and practical rationality, including primary norms. 


##### Draft 7

This dissertation defends the claim that some moral and epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents, and that such norms are best explained in terms of human nature (what we are), human flourishing (our end), and human virtues which are the means to flourishing. 

There is a danger that labels, which are useful for categorization, storage, and quick reference of arguments and beliefs, become more important than substantive arguments. Let me say here how I would label my view in terms of the labels fashionable in the early 2000s, and thereafter avoid trivial disputes. I take my metaethical view to be a brand of normative realism, emphasizing moral norms but using epistemic norms as allies. I take my ethical view to be a brand of virtue ethics. Talk about virtues, human nature, and flourishing or happiness I find the most helpful in solving knotty metaethical puzzles. Sometimes, as Thomas Nagel reminds me, the only solution to metaethical puzzles is to stick to primary ethical tools. 

The main rivals to my claim are: (a) the belief that no moral or epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents; or and a group of views (b) that such norms are indeed real but best understood in other terms. There are several rivals of this second class. In order of decreasing similarity to my own conclusion, beginning with *most* similar, they are: 

|Rival claim | Thinker | Label |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|
|* b1. Real norms are best understood as features of our human nature  | (McDowell) |Ethical naturalism
|* b5. Real norms are best understood as features of our rational minds | (Kant) | Ethical Rationalism
|* b4. Real norms are best understood as features of our social group | (MacIntyre?)| Social construct
|* b3. Real norms are best understood as features of our animal nature | (Foot)| Naturalism
|* b2. Real norms are best understood as features of the "natural world" |(Boyd)| Ethical naturalism

It will be quickly noticed that several of these views fly under the heading of 'naturalism'.  Hence I move to dispense with the titles. Instead, clarifying the claims, I shall argue for and against each claim in its own terms. In the final chapter I shall pick up the question of labels and definitions, again, after the dust has settled. 

There are a series of questions to which the best answer is "there are real norms or laws of thought and behavior that govern creatures like us." I lay out [a number] of criteria for what an adequate metaethical theory should explain. These criteria are, I hope, non-controversial, eminently common phenomena that we can all relate to. 

My first task in defending my primary thesis *could have been* to rehearse some of the arguments against normative nihilism, norm expressivism, etc. Instead, I shall argue that normative realism is a reasonable "defeasible presumption"[^14] that we ought to trust unless weighty objections arise. I then show that 'naturalism' provides exactly such weighty objections. But 'naturalism' is a a "philosopher's weasel-word."[^15] A naturalistic thesis, when clarified, will turn out to be one of a few kinds of thesis: 

[^15]:  Borrowing Terrence Cuneo's term from *The Normative Web*. 

* a trivial common sense metaphysical thesis; -- all that is real is real 
* a slightly less trivial anti-idealist metaphysical thesis; -- all that is material is real
* a universal reductive materialist thesis;  -- all that is real is material; nothing that is real is non-material
* or an atheistic thesis; -- nothing that is real is supernatural (i.e., God) [^16]

[^16]: Some might think that the reductive materialist thesis is for all intents and purposes identical to the atheistic thesis. But idoloters think that their god is material and pantheists think that matter too is god. 

So I reframe the so-called 'naturalists objection' in these three ways. The core objection I call the "argument from radical discontinuity."  The argument from radical discontinuity, or disharmony, finds various expressions in various books and articles but has, I think, one root. That root is important and true. I show how my account satisfies that search for radical continuity. So how does my account fare with respect to so-called naturalism, after disambiguation? I detail how my account 

*  agrees with 'naturalism' qua trivial metaphysical thesis; 
* disagrees with 'naturalism' qua reductively materialistic thesis
* does not disagree with 'naturalism' qua atheistic thesis. 

	It is indeterminate with respect to theism or atheism, though it fits better with theism. (My account makes theism more plausible and atheism less plausible. But it is not inconsistent with atheism nor does it entail theism. I call such a weak relationship a "fit" but indeterminate.)

	Some will find it strange that I argue for *holiness* without necessarily invoking religion, or *divinity* without necessarily attaching it to a god. It is strange, but not uncommon. Laozi's eternal Tao is divine without being a god. Aristotle's *nous* is a god without being a person. Even Kant's Christian God is not quite Swinburne's Christian God, with purposes, plans, and personality. I take my argument to be a conclusion about signs. The nature and reality of the signified is a whole different discussion. Could someone, beginning from the existence of a sign that most clearly points to a signified, make an argument that the signified in fact exists? Yes. Could someone else deny the signified, reinterpreting the sign? Yes. But both acknowledge and admit the existence and nature of the sign, including that it seems to point beyond itself. That's all I can hope for here. 
	
With these clarifications in hand, I proceed to examine the various rival views as espoused by their best proponents.  They all accept the reality of evaluative norms but explain them differently, offering different metaphysical frameworks and anthropological frameworks. I attempt to show in detail how each rival either misteps or goes only part of the way in the right direction. It misteps by invalidating one of our criteria. It only goes part of the way by only including some of our criteria, ignoring or disregarding the others. 

Having removed the teeth from the overriding motivation to be "naturalistic", these rival views turn out simply to be half-hearted substitutes for virtue. They are not even properly "rivals" nor are they clear-headed. The clear-headed work to be done is to clarify objections to virtue theory and articulate better answers and explanations. 

Finally, I consider objections that might show my claim to be false or otherwise inadequate (implausible, trivial, or useless). The biggest of these is that my conclusion does not "secure" the natural world from "outside" influence. The fear can be variously expressed: *You have not protected us from god.* Since I do not think that such laws are circumscribed to *humans*, the fear that there may be something or someone *else* out there -- be they aliens, angels, or gods -- is not a fear that should disturb our rational reflection on these questions. I reflect on the relation between my claim and theism. 

The conclusion of all this is that some kind of virtue theoretical account is not only truest but most useful. My claim, if true, helps to vindicate the excellent work in virtue ethics that is being done all over the world. It also vindicates the practical work of those leaders, parents, politicians, medical doctors, pastors, and professors, who deploy terms like 'virtue' and 'happiness' to motivate themselves and others in their care. 

The essays comprising this dissertation unfortunately defy categorization. The normative considerations in the first and last chapters might be called applied ethical. After all, we are trying to give good reasons and hear good reasons for our metaethical theory in order to *know* what to do with our ethical theories, and we care about our ethical theories (in part) because we care about our lives. We want to lie well, not badly. The "metaphysics of ethics" we must do (in response to Kant and Frank Jackson) to get a hold on human nature and the norms to which we are naturally sensitive requires a bit of metaphysical legwork. And, of course, there will inevitably be some room for moral epistemology, semantics, and moral motivation. With the great danger ever present that on any of these various topics I will mistep, I trust in the reader not to scoff but to correct, not to laugh but to help me learn.

            <Text>For Wielenburg, the emergence of the capacity to recognize moral rights coincides with the emergence of moral rights. He assumes that we have certain beliefs about personal space and the wrongness of transgressing personal space. You may not torture me for fun, I may not torture you  for fun. The fact that it is wrong supervenes on my cognitivefaculties, the same faculties with which I recognizeThe fact that it is wrong. Wielenburg argument parallels the argument of Robert George that our moral rights are grounded in our rational nature. Having a rational nature entails having certain rights; having a rational nature entails the capacity (realized or not) to develop the ability to recognize that all creatures with rational natures (both ourselves and others) have rights. (Wielenburg, On Evolutionary Debunking Arguments %) 


Joyce gives a debunking argument that amounts to a question begging analogy. Joyce commits the fallacy of Bulverism. He assumes his opponent is wrong and instead of getting arguments to that effect explains why his opponent came to believe such a falsehood.

	Two questions for Wielenburg are these: do animals not have any rights? And is there any evolutionary explanation for the emergence of cognitive capacities by which we recognize moral rights, a rational nature?

### Constructive Project &amp; Progress  ###

Macintyre is widely considered to be nothing but a “critic of modernity.” Anyone more than passingly familiar with his writings knows he is also a powerful positive voice for *improving* modernity. 

We must beware a misunderstanding. Any talk of “returning” to virtue is liable to sound nostalgic. Martha Nussbaum is one of many who have fallen to this misunderstanding.[@nussbaum1989recoiling] She begins her review of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* with an age-old dilemma between the social stability afforded by tradition (with its danger of hidebound error) and the social volatility endemic to critical reflection (with its opportunity of progress toward truth). She alludes to this dilemma as articulated by Aristotle: 

&gt;In the second book of the Politics, Aristotle asks whether it is a good thing to encourage changes in society. Should people be offered rewards for inventing some change in the traditional laws? No, he writes, because this would lead to instability and unnecessary tampering with what is working well. Should we, on the other hand, listen to those who wish to keep ancestral traditions fixed and immune from criticism? No again—for if we reason well we can make progress in lawmaking, just as we do in other arts and sciences.[@nussbaum1989recoiling]

Aristotle’s solution is that it should be hard but not impossible to change societal structures. Of course, we don’t have to pick just one or the other. But, putting it starkly, of the two it is better to risk instability (and gamble for progressing toward truth) than to risk hidebound error (and gamble for stability). 

Strangely, Nussbaum takes MacIntyre to be reversing Aristotle’s balance. She thinks MacIntyre is urging for betting on social stability even if it means sticking closer to existing tradition (and hence surpassing or intentionally avoiding critical reflection) than is compatible with unfettered progress.

This is not an objection to MacIntyre — it is a misreading. MacIntyre's proposed solution is not a sort of *anti-progressive* longing for the past. It is radically progressive. He rejected fideism and conservatism. His solution is not to reverse progress but to abandon the standard of progress set up in the Enlightenment and to continue under an alternative standard of progress. 

At the risk of sounding paradoxical, we might put it this way: MacIntyre's positive ethical positions are *traditional* but not *nostalgic.* In fact, his definition of tradition as an ongoing, socially-embedded argument over time entails necessarily that moral inquiry is dynamic, progressive, and even *modern*. For, to be traditional is not to be past-oriented; to be traditional is to be staunchly future-oriented, since the business of life is not only the pursuit of our telos but the transmission of everything valuable and precious to the next generation. 

The "*After Virtue* Project" is mostly constructive and creative. But up to and including *After Virtue*, MacIntyre may be seen as working to articulate criticisms that lead eventually to his epistemological and moral crisis. *After Virtue* and many of the works after have emphasized how and why to restore the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of virtue.


The origin of our inquiry is the concept of virtue. First we will ask a simple question, and expand the account as we elaborate the answer. What is MacIntyre's definition of virtue? 

### Stage One: Virtue in Practices ### 

He builds an account of virtue in three successive stages: personal, social, and traditional. Rather than attempt to encapsulate all three stages at once, it is wiser for us to retell his story in the same order. 

His first definition of virtue is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] This is the first stage or layer of his final account of virtue in *After Virtue*. A few preliminary comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are acquired. Meno asked Socrates whether virtues are "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is acquired. This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. 

Thirdly, virtues enable the achievement of *goods.* Virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally. A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both  instrumental to the achievement of certain goods and also partly constitutive of those goods. Virtues are means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. 

Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 
This worry exposes deep fault lines that we must return to below. For now, we will set them aside. 

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference to the goods internal to *practices*. Practice remains a key term for MacIntyre's ethical thought. To misunderstand the term of art 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So we must also elaborate on this concept and the concept of “internal goods” which is attached to it in this first definition. 

In the following sub-sections, I’ll build up the remaining two stages of MacIntyre’s final account of virtue by elaborating on three key components: practice, self, and tradition. 

### Stage Two: Practice, Self, Tradition ###

MacIntyre's 'practice' is a term of art. A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends.  Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, political activity, and several others as examples. Let’s look more closely at farming. Farming is a social activity undertaken let's say for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

A practice may be understood not as a mere action (like scratching an itch) but an intelligible set of actions embedded in a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is not just one action, but an intelligible set of actions (tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc.). 

The goods "internal" to farming are just those that necessarily constitute the practice as it is: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers produce comestibles, but I am speaking generally.) Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Virtues relative to the practice of farming include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Another and perhaps more clear example is one MacIntyre favors: political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the polis. But others (we need not speculate how many) engage in order to achieve “external” (unessential) goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power, or securing  book deals. Effectiveness in attaining these external goods does not constitute virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just any old sort of desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

Virtue defined by practice, then, is already importantly contrasted against mere *human happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. The standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal laws but immanent and flexible standards. The internal goal of farming is the production of edible food, and its practitioners qua farmers are committed to this goal without any eye toward the broader question of farming’s place in the broader social order. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. 

Even so, MacIntyre’s account of virtue eventually transcends this notion of practice. At least it transcends the narrowest definition of practice. His account of virtue includes three layers or dimensions: individual skill (like farming), social activity (like statesmanship), and human activity (like practical reasoning about how to live well). But it is essential to grasp the first layer. 

Lutz summarizes MacIntyre’s famous passage on virtue in this way: a practice is “(1) a complex social activity that (2) enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. (3) Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, (4) the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.”[@lutz2015] 


### Stage Two: Narrative Self ###

The start of MacIntyre's account is the definition of virtue strictly in terms of practices. And practices are activities individual persons undertake. But practices are themselves inherently social. They are undertaken by individuals but they are not individualistic. 

The second stage of the account expands its scope to include the social dimension of virtue more explicitly. Practices are already understood as social activities. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. So virtue and vice already have a social character in the first stage. But the second stage makes the social factor more explicit and deepens it. 

### Enlightenment Self ### 

What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast so well I shall quote them almost in full: 

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a telos, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific telos brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a telos external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. They celebrate the empty self's elimination of these strictures as an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

Edward Oakes describes the removal of telos from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”
&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed.
&gt;This is perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy. Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of telos, rightly restored to its proper place. 


### Real Self ###

The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self. MacIntyre here argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a few comments are worth making to clarify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map. 

Three considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. 
 
If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

MacIntyre explains the relationship between virtue, practices, and institutions like this: 

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]


### Human Virtue and the charge of relativism ### 

Thus far we have said that virtues are acquired qualities that enable individuals to achieve the internal goods of practices and we have said that the self is a social (not empty) self. 

One worry that many readers have had is that MacIntyre’s virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a practice? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. But MacIntyre denies being a relativist[@macintyre1984after xii-xiii in the 25th anniversary edition]. 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third stage. He admits that there might be evil practices. We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil. If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. 

To avoid relativism, he must add a third layer or dimension to his account of virtue. So the account must do justice to the assumption that virtues are good for their possessor. 

The third level, then, is the broadest — that of humanity. Individuals and societies or social groups do not share much (anything?) but what we are as biological and psychological creatures. MacIntyre admits that defining virtues in terms of practices necessitates questioning whether life as a whole can be virtuous — the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition. So, from this broadest view, even practices and institutions can be judged by how well they accord with our overall purpose, our overall life, and our overall nature. Here we can see the closest attachment to Aristotle's original sense of 'virtue'.

### Tradition and Humanity

Now, practices are distinct from (but related to) institutions or traditions. For example, a university is an institution defined by a set of practices in which professors and students engage. Thomism a tradition defined by a set of arguments playing out over time embedded in a social community. 


### *Dependent Rational Animals* ### 

This discussion has, so far, kept itself mostly to *After Virtue*, only alluding to other works in the “*After Virtue* Project.” I would like now to continue the story by including some themes and details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to a critical response. 

The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally important as our independence, our autonomy and self-sufficiency; there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate or overshadow the commonalities between us and other animals. “I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Regarding (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says he “virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities they're specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how do while they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.” (Op. Cit.). 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9]

So we may fairly draw this connection between *Dependent Rational Animals* and *After Virtue*: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and virtues must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

On the one extreme, we are not mere worms or beasts (without any practical reason whatsoever) nor, on the other extreme, are we autonomous gods (without any dependency whatsoever). A human being is a practical reasoner in a human community. I would venture so far as to suggest this axiom as a definition of our species. (It is more accurate than flat-nailed featherless bipeds.) We are social animals by nature, and we are practical animals by nature, and we are reasoners by nature. 

### We are practical reasoners ### 

### Human virtue as practical reasoning since human nature is practical reason
As for human nature, human beings are practical reasoners; we are dependent, rational animals. That is what we are. And yes, we have natures. That word and that concept are not out-dated, outmoded, irrelevant, obsolete, unscientific, or any other such slur. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] And we are practical reasoners (more on that below). We are in a position to see how MacIntyre’s account of virtue works. We find ourselves in a tradition (or more than one). Within that, we find ourselves engaging in practices. We engage in some of these practices inside, and others outside, institutions. Virtues are those skills that enable us to perform the practice excellently; virtues are also those skills and habits by which we perform various social roles excellently; but finally virtues are those qualities by which we aim our practices toward an excellent human life, and by which we integrate our various social roles toward human ends. For instance, the most general virtuous qualities contribute to the flourishing of human being qua practical reasoner. The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. The “human nature” that is universally distributed across each member of our species is the capacity (sometimes unrealized) to become practical reasoners. This  makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. 

We are practical reasoners. Observations we can readily make to support this axiom are so abundant it is hard to know where to start: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. 

Each of these situations, I hope, so familiar that my analysis will not (yet!) be controversial. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

If this is true, the converse would be true: those who are not practical reasoners, or not in community, are not human. Regardless of whether this strikes a false note for the reader, it is at least intelligible. this corollary is the natural extension of the Greek view that exile was on par with, if not worse than, public execution. To remove you from your community is in an important sense to destroy you as a person. A hanging or poisoning only destroys you as a body. An exile is far worse than that. It rips you from your context, tears out from the social fabric the thread that you are. It turns you, while existing, into a non-being, a non-entity, an object. Regardless of whether we can sympathize with this way of thinking about exile, we can understand how one can be demoted from human status. 

We should not say that a non-practical-reasoner is not human, but that they fail to be exemplary. Brain-dead, or mentally handicapped, or injured etc., persons are not non-human but they are importantly defective qua humans, as I think common sense can recognize. 


### Virtue and telos/eudaimonia ### 

So much for a summary of MacIntyre’s account of virtue. Some further comments are needed to fill out the relationship of virtue to eudaemonia. Talk of human nature and telos are inseparable. For MacIntyre, the loss of telos (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But telos unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear telos is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

MacIntyre’s provisional conception of our human telos is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human telos is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our telos consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single telos governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.


### Aristotle ###

MacIntyre revisits the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”: the *Nicomachean Ethics.* There we find the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Hence our practical rationality is natural even though it is not material. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The telos of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 



### Virtue ethicist?  ###

Interestingly, though MacIntyre has contributed to contemporary virtue ethics and influenced many virtue ethicists, he denies the epithet himself because he worries that modern virtue ethics has not fully cured itself of the same assumption of teleological nihilism that plague rationalistic moralities.  

Even so, MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. Even though such a common vision of and pursuit of virtue is impossible to scale up indefinitely for 300+ millions people (in the U.S., for instance), it is possible and beneficial at smaller, local scales. And indeed, this is already happening. 

At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. Weinstein says that the primary theme of his work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre %%page number%%] In this he defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but simply is the domain of *living well*.  *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and "Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

In the following sections, I will attempt to trace in more detail his account of virtue and his account of how virtue and practical rationality are partially constituted by the traditions in which we live and move and have our being. 


### Virtue and Telos/Eudaimonia
With this in mind, the relation between virtue and telos comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our telos. 

MacIntyre says: 
&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of telos as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist. A cheeky paraphrase would be to: our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human telos (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the telos might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our telos consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate telos of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. </Text>

Gilbert Harman
Overview:
Synopsis:
Reflections:
Gilbert Harman asks whether "moral claims can be tested against moral reality" (Gilbert Harman, "Moral Expalanations of Natural Facts", Southern Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 24 (1986) pp. 57-68.) His short answer is 'No.' But Sturgeon and Railton and others are up to Harman's challenge. They show moral claims being tested against moral reality or moral explanations of natural facts being superior in plausibility or explanatory power to nonmoral explanations. Sturgeon, for instance, thinks that when I see boys setting a cat on fire I come to believe that something wrong is happening.  Just as I explain my belief that my computer is on by observing that the screen is lighting up (in response to the fact), the most plausible explanation for my belief is that something wrong is happening is that the cat burning is going on right in front of me. </Text>

            <Text>Chapter 1 Introduction

Annas aims to “produce an account of virtue” (1). Though there has been a revival of interest in virtue, not all accounts agree. 
Annas’ account attends to two interrelated ideas: “exercising a virtue involves practical reasoning of a kind that can illuminatingly be compared to the kind of reasoning we find in someone exercising a practical skill” (1); and “virtue is part of the agent’s happiness or flourishing, and that it is possible to see virtue as actually constituting (wholly or in part) that happiness. 
The first idea is sometimes called the “skill analogy”, though it may not be an analogy at all but an identity. 
Annas “plunges into developing” her theory of virtue as skill and virtue as at least partially constitutive of eudaemonia (happiness or flourishing — a term she clarifies later) since she believes “that these ideas are far more intuitive and empirically rooted than often assumed” (2). Her theory is “holistic in structure; the different parts are mutually supportive” (3). 
A response: Annas’ account reflects a truth I think is important: virtue theories are “bottom-up” theories. John Arras distinguishes between “high moral theory” (e.g., Kantian deontology, classical utilitarianism) which aspires to generalization, universality, abstractness, systematic organization, simplicity, and comprehensiveness and “common moral theory” (e.g., casuistry, bioethical principlism, commonsense morality). Commonsense morality, “folk morality,” is bottom-up. It takes as uncontroversial starting points certain brute and apparently obvious moral truths: murder is wrong; loyalty to family and friends is admirable; Joe is truly a hero; Jack is a slouch, a vagabond, a cad. 
Virtue theorists have been more or less interested in sublimating their ethical theory into high moral theory.

Julia Annas’ discussion of happiness

Happiness is an indeterminate concept. This judgment of indeterminacy is, in some books, a critique (Brown 2008; Hoffe 2006). But indeterminacy is a necessary and salutary feature of the concept. In Aristotle’s account, the indeterminacy of eudaemonia allows it to serve as the global telos of each human being and of human beings as a natural kind. 

The internal connection between virtue and happiness has seemed “profoundly unlikely” to philosophers of the last two hundred years or so (Annas 2011, 119). 

“She argues that exercising a virtue involves practical reasoning of the kind we find in someone exercising an everyday practical skill, such as farming, building, or playing the piano. This helps us to see virtue as part of an agent's happiness or flourishing.” (Author’s abstract)

            <Title>Frederick, Naturalism and the Human Condition: Against Scientism</Title>
            <Text>Olafson, Frederick A. Naturalism and the Human Condition: Against Scientism. Routledge, 2003.


The book finds it genesis in Olafson’s concern that naturalism is in the unchallenged ascendant. He very concisely covers the major threads of the naturalist position, that is that it is only through examination of the natural world that we may be certain of anything; and he freely concedes that in many circumstances this is entirely appropriate. However, he also points out that it leaves many gaps in what is clearly our experience of the world, our phenomenological knowledge of our lives. In order to understand the implications of this, he takes the reader on a tour of areas of major concern, and areas in which naturalism may seem to have an unrivalled place, such as the nature of language or what the brain actually does. Then, with the help of a number of distinguished tour guides, to whom he pays deference such as Heidegger and his notion of being in the world, in particular but also Merleau-Ponty and his philosophy of consciousness, and others, he begins to examine some of the blind spots of naturalism.
For Olafson the search for unity in knowledge, the great project to define and categorize the world, is in fact an ideological rather than truth-seeking activity, and aims, rather contrarily, at the “uniformity of knowledge”. Thus, dogmatic scientism does not free us, it restricts us. However, and this is one of the main points of his thesis, he argues that naturalism is in the end confused, contradictory and self-defeating. It deludes itself into believing that the principles on which it rests are self-evident and beyond challenge. Yet, Olafson argues, they are in fact based on, and can only be understood by the very philosophical positions they seek to deny. 

Human beings, Olafson points out, live with each other in a condition of transcendence, not just of material relationships. It is only by acknowledging and examining our sense of being in the world that we can begin to understand that there is no “royal road” to the truth, but many and protean explorations. To believe in a single dogma is to lay a dead hand on what it is to be human.
Having laid out his argument Olafson asks, in a very reasonable way, where we are to go from here and whether it is possible to “think together world and nature”. He does not offer many options here; rather he is content to think his contribution as part of the process (which is after all his preferred method). Nevertheless, he does make it clear that the zero-sum game of science and religion, the sense that they are in some sort of struggle for supremacy in which one can only win if the other loses, is not either very productive, nor very helpful to any of us. The world should not be confused with nature because, in Olafson’s view, the view we have come to have of nature is in fact seen through the prism of scientism and thus defined in terms of the other rather than itself.
Olafson states that his intention in writing the book was to justify his hunch, that naturalism gets it wrong, to himself and anyone else who might be interested. It can be said with some certainty that many people are interested in just that question, and a book such as this, which is modest in ambition if not in scope, is a worthy contribution. It cannot always be said that he achieves his aim of writing for the “educated general reader”. There is often an unjustified assumption that his prose is without jargon or unnecessarily wordy. However, it is a thoughtful and provocative work that will stimulate debate, raise some pertinent questions and add a little pin prick to any smug self-satisfaction that scientism is indeed solely capable of explaining the human condition.


A response: The dialectical and rhetorical goal of Olafson needs adjusting. The dialectical goal is to persuade self-describing naturalists that they are, in some way, wrong. Presumably, it would be enough if such naturalists — be they philosophers or scientists or laymen — examine the axiomatic assumptions they hold and really follow through the arguments </Text>

        <Document ID="408">
            <Title>Timmons (ed), Metaethics After Moore</Title>
            <Text>Darwell’s essay argues that metaethics (or analytic ethics or critical ethics) is best practiced within a dynamic union with normative ethics. (The combination of the two, Darwall suggests, might be called philosophical ethics.) Not only was this how Moore approached ethics in 1903, but it is how many contemporary writers are approaching ethics, despite the trend in the middle of the century to write either about metaethical issues or ignore them for the sake of normative ethical ones. 

I take my task to be to advance anglophone virtue ethics but to do so by virtue of addressing head on some of the most pressing, most challenging, and (to me at least) most interesting objections and questions. Objections come from opponents and questions from often confused bystanders.  
In one sense, the normative ethical content of virtue ethics is simple: go acquire virtues. There is much more to it than that. But virtue education tries to instill virtues in children; virtue politics tries to create polities in which it is “easy to be good” and politicians who are scrupulous, upstanding, wise, honest, and trustworthy; virtue epistemology tries to show what character traits are necessary or beneficial or sufficient for being the kind of person who can know things. And so on. 
But then the questions begin: which traits are virtues? What do you mean by “virtuous”? Is there really happiness? 

Many of the objections and questions for virtue ethical writers like MacIntyre, Foot, Hursthouse, and McDowell are objections and questions with correlates outside of virtue ethics. 
1. Words. Moore’s analytic ethics was part of the linguistic turn in philosophy.Metaethics After Moore %  He thought the failure of much ethical writing before him was a lamentable inattention to the terms deployed in that writing. What is a virtue? What does it mean to say that the natural end of human life is happiness? 
2. Properties. Moore argued that goodness was a simple, undefinable concept and a simple, non-natural and irreducible property. Just what are we talking about in the nexus of related locutions like the following? Virtues are good for people; happiness is the good; for people like us, goodness is virtue. What is a virtue (not the word now, but the thing)? 
3. Knowledge. Moore argued that the belief “X is good” is based on noticing the property of goodness — intuited directly — and neither requires nor admits of support from any other belief. How do I know which traits are virtues? 
	3b. Disagreement. If I can intuit that X is good but you cannot, is there any way to adjudicate our disagreement? In the context of virtue ethics, how do I know which list of virtues to ally myself to? 
4. Human Nature. Moore argues that the greatest intrinsic goods are, for us, the pleasures of friendship and the pleasures of beauty (in art and nature). These are the goods worth pursuing, and the production of these goods justifies right actions. But what are we? And what is our relationship to nature? What are human beings such that we enjoy friendship and create and consume beauty? In this vein, is there really a human nature such that happiness or eudaemonia even makes sense conceptually? 
5. Nature (all of reality). Moore opens up the discussion for a cosmic rather than merely human perspective when he includes the beauty of nature. This cosmological perspective is welcome.Panayot Butchvarov, “Ethics Dehumanized” in Metaethics After Moore. % Human beings need not and ought not occupy “center stage” of our ethical thinking. 
	5b. Under this heading, is nature teleological? Is there such thing as natural normativity?  

So each of the thinkers I will examine are virtue ethicists but also address, more or less explicitly, these five metaethical topics and these (or closely related) objections and/or questions. </Text>

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

For MacIntyre, moral inquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such inquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. </Text>

Philippa Foot, Natural Goodness
Overview:
Goodness is ‘intrinsic’ or ‘natural’ to species-types. 

Synopsis

Introduction
The book is crude but that’s the only way we shall get on (2). 
We could start with ‘pleasure is good’ like Moore did, but that is wrong since the predicate has a different logical function (2-3) — good always means good for someone. 
Goodness is ‘natural goodness and defect in living things’ (3). 

Good and red are different.
The house is beautiful (doesn’t need complement)
The house is useful (needs complement — for a mom of six). 

A fresh start?
“One finds its deepest roots in David Hume...” (6). “This is the subjectivism — often called ‘non-cognitivism’ — that came to the fore with A. J. Ayer, C. L. Stevenson, and Richard Hare, informed the work of John Mackie and many others, and has lately appeared, refreshed, in Alan Gibbard’s ‘expressivist’ account of normative language. Simon Blackburn, reviewing Gibbard’s Wise Choices, Apt Feelings, has said that he hopes this book will now set the agenda for moral philosophy” (5). 

Meaning was thus to be explained in terms of a speaker’s attitude, intentions, or state of mind. And this opened up a gap between moral judgments and assertions... Fact, complementary to assertion, had been distinguished from value, complementary to the expression of feeling, attitude, or commitment to action (8).

“Their theories were devised to take account of something that really is a feature of moral judgment: the ‘action-guiding’ character of morality, which Hume had insisted on and taken as the foundation of his moral philosophy. Morality, Hume had said, is necessarily practical, serving to produce and prevent action, and I shall call this ‘Hume’s practicality requirement.’ Emotivism satisfies the requirement in the wrong way. (9). 
Reflections
She is working with Anscombe, since she is a student of hers and also an admirer. 

On the history of subjectivism 
“One finds its deepest roots in David Hume...” (6). “This is the subjectivism — often called ‘non-cognitivism’ — that came to the fore with A. J. Ayer, C. L. Stevenson, and Richard Hare, informed the work of John Mackie and many others, and has lately appeared, refreshed, in Alan Gibbard’s ‘expressivist’ account of normative language. Simon Blackburn, reviewing Gibbard’s Wise Choices, Apt Feelings, has said that he hopes this book will now set the agenda for moral philosophy” (5). 

On practical rationality
“(A) Reasons for acting, which we may call practical reasons.
(B) Reasons for believing, which we may call evidential or demonstrative reasons.
As philosophers, and therefore theoreticians, our job is of course to give the second type of reason, arguing for or against the truth of a variety of propositions that seem to involve special problems— like those, for instance, about personal identity or the existence of the external world. But among these many ‘philosophical’ subjects we find that of the nature of practical reasons, and in this special case we shall have to give reasons of type B for theses about reasons of type A.” (64)

**Against Subjectivity of Values**

## Introduction
John Mackie’s classic essay is famous for arguing that “there are no objective values” (13).[All page citations in this paper refer to Mackie's essay "The Subjectivity of Values" in Shafer-Landau and Cuneo (eds). *Foundations of Ethics: An Anthology.* Blackwell, 2007. The original essay is a chapter from @mackie.] He accepts the heavy burden of proof a subjectivist has to bear to overturn the “defeasible presumption”[@nagel2012mind] argued in the “main tradition of European moral philosophy” and assumed in our moral language that (some) moral values are objective entities in the “fabric of the world”, that such values are categorically motivating regardless of the agent’s desires and beliefs, and that being a moral person in part is constituted by the recognition and proper response to such values. 

His two arguments (from “relativity” and from “queerness”) aim to bear that burden of proof and to establish that right and wrong (etc.) are not real but falsely “objectified” into world by our thought and language. In this response paper, I summarize Mackie’s arguments and critically analyze them. 	
In a first brief pass I restate his major theses and premises; in a second more detailed pass I discuss Mackie’s objections to his own points, his rebuttals to those objections, and my additional objections. 

I’m afraid I shall not have much favorable to say of Mackie’s arguments. My conclusion, in brief, is that some values do indeed seem objective, and that the burden of proof on those who would deny the appearances would require much more substantial arguments than Mackie’s. The acceptance of some moral values as objective seems to me a safer philosophical bet than almost any other, and his discussion, though justly famous for its expression and pithiness, is too erroneous to come close to justifying their rejection.  

## Preliminary Summary

### Thesis and Key Terms

The primary thesis of Mackie's essay is that “there are no objective values” (13). Values like goodness, rightness, wrongness, and also beauty or ugliness are “not part of the fabric of the world” (13). This claim has two parts. The ontological part is that such values do not exist. The epistemological part is that, even if they did, our epistemic access to them would require the existence of a *sui generis* mysterious faculty of moral perception. Since no such faculty exists, we are justified in rejection the existence of objective values. 

He calls this conclusion “moral skepticism” and "subjectivism" but distinguishes his position from other positions that have been similarly labeled.[^2]By arguing that there are no objective values, Mackie is arguing that there is no "categorically imperative element” to moral oughts (15). There are no entities in the world such that I ought to do X or not do Y regardless of my desires, contingent wants and needs. 

Mackie clarifies that all the psychological activities of wanting, preferring, valuing, praising, blaming and so on are *subjective* in the sense that *subjects* perform them, but that to concede this is not does not entail that there are no objective values. Rather, even though *subjects* want, prefer, value, praise, and blame, it has been thought that subjects attempt to do so *in appropriate response to* objective values. Objective values so to speak obligate* certain responses (such as respect for elders, and hatred of evil) and categorically provide reason for certain actions (such as doing your duty or avoiding cruelty). It has been the “main tradition of European moral philosophy includes [the claim] that there are objective values of just the sort I have denied” (15).[^1]  These values are assumed or argued to exist as part of the “fabric of the world” and to be knowable. 

Surprisingly, Mackie sets himself to subvert not only the “main tradition” of moral philosophy but to subvert that which has “a firm basis in ordinary thought, and even in the meanings of moral terms” (16). He admits that ordinary moral judgments and ordinary moral emotions (we might simply call them *ordinary emotions*) are only intelligible on the assumption that objective moral values exist. Confirmation comes from the admitted psychological cost of the denial of objective values, which is “an extreme emotional reaction, a feeling that nothing matters at all, that life has lost its purpose” (17). And confirmation seems to come from the cost of denying that our moral terms refer, which is the need to provide a comprehensive non-cognitivist or non-descriptivist theory of the pragmatics of moral talk (16). Mackie thinks the cost of these subversions, though high, ought to be paid. 

### Three Arguments 

The moral skepticism thesis that there are no objective values he supports with three main considerations: The first is that the absence of moral values is the best explanation of “moral relativity” (or moral disagreement); the second is that objective values, if they existed, would be objectionable queer. (By queer, of course, he means, weird, unique, unprecedented, unusual, sui generis, strange, baffling, mysterious, opaque, and so on.) The third consideration is different. It aims *assumes* that the first two arguments are sound and proceeds to show that the persistence of our belief in objective values can be explained as an instance of objectification — that is, the reification and externalization of our moral attitudes, beliefs, preferences, wishes, and so on. Let’s consider each of these in a bit more detail before critically analyzing them. 

The first positive argument for Mackie’s thesis is the argument from relativity (which I shall call the argument from disagreement). The argument from relativity or disagreement is this: moral codes vary between societies at a time and within a society across time. One society endorses polygamy, another condemns it; one society endorses human sacrifice, another condemns it; one endorses revenge killing, another condemns it. An explanation of the wide variation and instability of these endorsements and condemnations, as well as the accompanying attitudes of approval, disgust, honor, is that there are no objective values at work. The moral code of a society is not a map of what is “really” morally lawful, but a map of that societies attitudes, endorsements, and condemnations. I will summarize Mackie’s own discussion of the argument from relativity below. 

The second positive argument is the argument from queerness. The argument from queerness builds on the sense that “if there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe” (19). Objective values would be esoterica, akin to non-natural qualities, Plato’s transcendent Form of Good. They would be (like divine commands from heaven)  authoritatively prescriptive yet empirically unverifiable. (Mackie is as poetic as possible in making the descriptive seem mundane and the prescriptive seem mystical.) What’s more, their power of categorical commendation, of obligating us to act in certain ways irrespective of our desires, is utterly unique. The reasoning seems to be that we assume the world is a unified whole, and we know a lot about spatio-temporal, physical entities, include evolved animals like ourselves who are language-users, concept-users, and evaluators. We know that we are motivated by our desires, preferences, by the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. So it seems more reasonable "To ask no more of the world than we already know is there—the ordinary features of things on the basis of which we make decisions about them, like or dislike them, fear them and avoid them, desire them and seek them out. It asks no more than this: a natural world, and patterns of reaction to it."[@blackburn1984] It does not seem necessary to posit abstract, non-physical entities that have no intrinsic relation to our other psychological states such as our desires and approvals. 

The third argument depends for its force on the success of the other two. *If* and only if values are subjective, then the question “Why do we tend to objectify values?” is an interesting question. If values are not subjective, of course, then this question is fallacious, for it presupposes the conclusion it is supposed to support (which is a *petitio principi*) and assumes that identifying the *origin* of a belief can disprove the belief (which is a genetic fallacy). 

## Critical Discussion

With these overview summaries in hand, we can critically discuss these points. I shall summarize in more detail Mackie’s discussion of objections to his two main arguments, his own rebuttals of those objections, and I shall offer my own critical discussion. 

### Distorted Moral Perception reply to Moral Disagreement Argument

Mackie provides one reply to the argument from relativity or disagreement: Perhaps there is another explanation, that varying moral codes “express perceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly distorted, of objective values” (18). (Call this the *Distorted Moral Perception* reply.)People and societies vary on evaluative matters in the same way and for the same reason that people and societies vary on scientific, historical, legal, and other matters. Perhaps she disagreements between people and societies — the varieties of moral codes — is similar to scientific or historical disagreements. Scientific disagreements arise between people offering different “speculative inferences or explanatory hypotheses based on inadequate evidence” (18). I think Mackie is suggesting that two people might dispute a particular point (is Pluto a planet? Is this the tooth of a dinosaur or platypus?) because neither of them has fully accurate knowledge and both are doing the best they can with the available evidence, though future evidence may be forthcoming. 

But the Distorted Moral Perception reply is, Mackie thinks, false. He denies that objective values are the kinds of entities about which more evidence may be forthcoming. The analogy to scientific or historical disagreements, then, does not hold. 

Mackie is seriously misguided here. The argument from disagreement has been so often deployed and so widely misunderstood it is hard to know where to start.[@enoch2009moral] The argument from disagreement can be simplified as the conditional syllogism that if values were objective, there would be little or no widespread, profound disagreement on moral values. There is widespread, profound disagreement. So values are not objective.  There are two possible challenges, and I think both are justified.[@sepmoralantirealism] The first is to deny that disagreement is so widespread as to be a massive problem for moral realism. The second is to deny that (even if there *were*) widespread variation in moral codes between people and societies, that we should take that as reason to be skeptical about moral values; it is rather good reason to think values are indeed objective. 

Let's take each of these challenges in turn. Moral disagreement is not good reason to be skeptical about the objectivity moral values because such disagreement is saliently identical to scientific and philosophical disagreement; and scientific and philosophical disagreements are not good reason to be skeptical about scientific realism or optimistic engagement in philosophical dialectic. Some scientific disputes will probably never be resolved with reference to new empirical data: what happened seconds before the Big Bang? What is the necessary and sufficient condition for a discipline to be considered a science? And certainly some philosophical disputes certainly will never be resolved by adequate empirical evidence: Is idealism or empiricism or rationalism true, or something else? The persistence of idealists, rationalists, empiricists etc., for the last 2000 years (at least) shows that such disputes are ongoing and not likely to be resolved. If that idealogical disagreement is evidence that there is no fact of the matter — no objective truth — then perhaps Mackie can use moral disagreement as evidence that there is no objective value. But if he thinks, say, idealism is false and empiricism true, despite the existence of people and schools of thought who mistakenly hold that idealism is true, then he ought to think also that (say) those who hold Moral Code A are getting the objective values accurately, while those who hold Moral Code B are mistaken. 

As for denying that moral disagreement is as widespread as often assumed, Mackie himself offers an objection to the argument from relativity: perhaps some very broad moral principles *are* universally recognized. For example, isn't it universally recognized that (say) it is good to promote the general happiness? Perhaps these broad moral principles are agreed upon in a way that renders moral disagreement less puzzling and the existence of objective values more plausible. Call this the Moral Agreement reply. 

I think the Moral Agreement reply is a serious problem for the would-be opponent of objective value. But Mackie’s reasons for rejecting it are puzzling. First, he complains that arguing that broad, elevated moral principles are objective entails that specific, practical moral principles are contingent. He says, “if things had been otherwise, quite different sorts of actions would have been right” (19). What is the substance of this reply? It is eminently true that “if things had been otherwise, quite different sorts of actions would have been right” — if for instance humans could breath underwater, then waterboarding would not be wrong because it would not be torturous and therefore cruel. If Bob’s society was communist then amassing capital for his own personal use would be selfish and illegal and therefore antisocial. These counterfactuals are just what we would predict if general moral principles reflected universal, objective values. 

Second, Mackie suggests that most people’s moral lives and moral judgments do not actually operate according to specification of “general principles.” Rather, people seem to make moral judgments and live their moral lives according to certain “immediate responses” and “basic moral judgments”. 

Thankfully, Mackie does not spend too much time elaborating on this paper thin reply and moves on to the argument from queerness. We can reflect on our own moral judgments for a moment to explore what it might mean that we often make moral judgments as immediate aroused responses. For example, perhaps we hear a news story about a woman beating, scalding, suffocating, and finally murdering her children before storing their corpses in a freezer.[^3] That immediately strikes me as cruel, sick, degraded, disgusting, and wrong. It “arouses” disgust in me immediately. Whether this response is the logical extension of a moral principle I reflectively endorse (such as “parents should care for their children” or “cruelty is wrong”) or merely a pre-reflectively, visceral attitude is irrelevant to whether the moral judgment accurately reflects the objective value of parental love. 

So I think Mackie's reply inadequate, and the Moral Agreement reply stands. 


###  The Problem of Moral Agreement


We can make it stronger.  My own challenge to the argument from relativity is to focus more closely on general and specific moral codes that appear well-nigh universal. For instance, the universal prohibition on incestuous relationships, the blame of immoderation (drunkenness or alcoholism are condemned in every society in the world), the praise of justice and compassion, specifically caring for the poor, widows, and orphans.[@abolition Appendix I: Illustrations of the Tao. Lewis, a literary scholar, compiles a list of agreeing moral codes from a variety of ancient, medieval, and modern codes.] These are transcultural and span all known historical periods. They are “general” principles and also rather specific. The best explanation for their widespread agreement is that they are expressions of objective value.

Add to the Moral Agreement reply the Distorted Moral Perception reply, and the case is even stronger. Even though there is some variation on such moral principles, we can plausibly explain *at least some* moral disagreement by reference to distorted perception or inadequate moral education. This is not saliently different than when we plausibly explain *at least some* scientific disputes by reference to researcher bias, inadequate scientific or logical thinking, etc. 

###  Objective Values are Strange

The famed argument from queerness Mackie calls “even more important… and certainly more generally applicable” than the argument from disagreement. I do not think it fares any better.  

The first reply to the argument from queerness Mackie considers is this: perhaps objective values are not so strange (in that they are like essences, numbers, substances, necessity and possibility, causation, etc.) even though they are *are* unlike descriptive facts. (Call this the Partners in Crime reply.)

But Mackie thinks the Partners in Crime reply would be ultimately impotent if we could show that we can “on empiricist foundations…we construct an account of the ideas and beliefs and knowledge that we have of all these matters” (19). He does not try to construct such an account. But even if an empiricist foundation could not be given, that failure would indeed not support the existence of objective values but tell *against* the existence of essences, numbers, and so on.

The success of the objection that objective values are not saliently different from other unobjectionable abstract entities or concepts like necessity or causation depends on the details. Russ Shafer-Landau[@shafer2003moralrealism], Terence Cuneo[@cuneo2007], David Enoch[@enoch2011taking]f are philosophers who have recently provided these details and shown (though I shall not try to show it here) that indeed objective values are not any more objectionable than other kinds of abstract objects. For example, Cuneo argues that whatever “objectionable features” moral norms display are also displayed *inter alia* by epistemic norms. If Mackie is an ‘epistemic skeptic’ then he must deny the intrinsic, categorical, reason-giving force of such epistemic value judgments as *you ought to believe whatever proposition is supported by the best evidence.*

The epistemological part of the argument from queerness is that objective values, if they existed, would be known through an utterly unique and correspondingly queer faculty (19). He doesn’t just mean they would be unverifiable empirically (that too). He means that it is difficult to imagine how something like Plato’s Form of the Good could be such that “knowledge of it provides the knower with both a direction and an overriding motive; something’s being good both tells the person who knows this to pursue it and makes him pursue it… the end has to-be-pursuedness somehow built into it” (20). But, Mackie thinks, Hume has successfully argued that reasons (instances of knowing that p) cannot be “reasons” (instances of motivating to act). The notion that values and disvalues intrinsically influence the will to pursue and avoid them postulates “value-features of quite a different order from anything else with which we are acquainted, and of a corresponding faculty with which to detect them” (20). 

To further underscore the weirdness of objective value, Mackie poses the question of how we are to suppose moral qualities relate to natural facts. Even if we argue that the moral quality of wrongness “supervenes” on or “is entailed by” the natural facts (say, on the fact that the children are lighting the cat on fire), we deserve an account of the alleged supervenient or entailed quality. More likely than that we are able to “just see” the “wrongness” in the natural state of affairs, it seems more likely to Mackie that we are recognizing ordinary qualities such as that the action is socially condemned, and that we disprove. 


###  Further Replies

The argument from queerness does not tell much — if at all — against the existence of objective moral standards. Mackie’s argument has been called, and rightly so, an fallacy of the appeal to personal incredulity. The argument from personal incredulity has something of the form of “If on my assumptions or background beliefs p is hard for me to believe, then p is false.” If I were to be cheeky, I would say summarize Mackie’s argument from queerness — the “even more important” of the two arguments that there are no objective values — like this: *To someone who shares my hidebound scientistic ideology, abstract objective values with intrinsically motivating features seem weird. Therefore, objective values they don’t exist.*

Now this reply is certainly too pugnacious. Mackie’s argument is influential and expresses, in compressed form, some widespread beliefs that he defends at greater length elsewhere, and that are defended by others. But it is true that objective values seem incommensurate with metaphysical naturalism, or physicalism, or scientism. My point is that one who is firmly convinced of scientism might express (as Mackie does) a dismay at the notion of objective value; but one who is firmly convinced of objective value might express dismay at the notion of scientism. Absent further support for the dogma that all of the universe is *nothing more* than a manifold of physical objects, these two are expressions of dismay are equally valid and therefore equally useless. 

Christine Korsgaard has also replied to the argument from queerness. She concedes that categorically-obligating entities are different from other entities, but denies the suggestion that they therefore do not exist. She says: “It's true that they are queer sorts of entities and that knowing them isn't like anything else. But that doesn't mean that they don't exist.... For it is the most familiar fact of human life that the world contains entities that can tell us what to do and make us do it. They are people, and the other animals.”[@korsgaard1996sources 166.] This reply seems to me right. 

Mark Timmons has clarified one part of Mackie’s argument to be the worry that the supervenience of moral properties on non-moral properties (such as biological or psychological ones) is somehow mysterious.[@timmons1999morality] In response, Russ Shafer-Landau has offered compelling arguments that such supervenience is no more or less objectionable than the supervenience of higher-order natural properties (like life) on lower-order natural properties (like certain cellular or molecular structures).[@shafer2003moralrealism, chapter 4.] Shafer-Landau also critiques the Humean theory of psychology that underlies part of Mackie’s worry about queerness.[@shafer2003moralrealism, chapter 5.]


## Conclusion

Mackie’s famous arguments attempt to overcome the prima facie case that moral values are objective. His case attempts to show that the acceptance of moral values is so undesirable and so highly implausible that it outweighs even the very undesirable consequences of their rejection. In this paper, I have tried to show that his first argument (from relativity or disagreement) does not prove or even very plausibly suggest that all values are merely subjective. Rather, the existence of objective values (and the sometime difficulty of discerning them) explains moral disagreement better than the subjectivity of values; furthermore, the existence of objective values (and the sometime ease of discerning them) explains widespread, cross-cultural, trans-generational moral agreement about general and specific moral claims like that stealing is wrong and caring for the poor is admirable. 

I have also tried to show that his second (“more important”) argument amounts to a re-statement of how things appear to one already convinced of philosophical or metaphysical naturalism rather than a persuasive case that such appearances accurately represent reality. All of the legitimate puzzles about objective values or objective moral laws that Mackie’s account highlights can be — and have been — dealt with quiet respectably by other authors. 

In short, there very much seem to be objective values. The best explanation of this appearance is that there are objective values. And the opponent of the appearances has much more difficult task than Mackie — or perhaps anyone — has ever been able successfully to perform. 


[^1]:The doctrine of objective value that Mackie ascribes to the “main tradition of European moral philosophy” is indeed assumed in Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, and even Kant.  C. S. Lewis puts this way: “This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike... is the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are... I myself do not enjoy the society of small children: because I speak from within the Tao I recognize this as a defect in myself — just as a man may have to recognize that he is tone deaf or colour blind.” @abolition.

[^2]:  On skepticism: One kind of moral skeptic rejects conventional morality or his own society’s morality but endorses another modified morality or alternative set of putatively objective values (13). Another kind of moral skeptic might even accept conventional morality (as a fiction, say) but deny that morality is about anything “out there” in the world.  On subjectivism: The “first order, normative, view… that everyone really ought to do whatever he thinks he should” is irrelevant (14). As a second order view, ‘subjectivism’ sometimes refers to the thesis that declarative sentences with a predicate of value just express the approval or disapproval of the speaker. Mackie is not at pains to defend this kind of expressivism. Rather, he defends a negative thesis that objective values do not exist. Now, if objective values do not exist, then we might naturally wonder how and why moral language functions the way it does. But these are separate questions. Mackie’s theory is not a type of expressivism but of error-theory.

            <Title>## Notes 10/14/15</Title>
            <Text>We have seen MacIntyre’s argument that a-teleological ethics is purposeless ethics. We have seen that much of modern moral theorizing is such purposeless ethics — a set of abstract rules (supposed to satisfy the demands of universal duty) or a set of actions (supposed to be likely to cause the desired consequences) devoid of historical context and social content. And we have seen that the restoration of teleological virtues, in their social/traditional context, makes the whole *quest of life* intelligible, including the practical reason needed to live well and the moral virtues needed to avoid temptations to live poorly and to become fully human. These teleological virtues we grounded in human practice. 
We have seen with Foot that there may indeed be *biological* grounding for teleological virtue as well. As Aristotle observed, and as any present day observer can confirm for himself, there is a parity between the *the nature of living beings as they appear to us* and functional and semantic properties in our language (both words and grammar). If this is right, then the Great Platitudes that living virtuously is living a *fully human* life is vindicated. We are required by practical rationality, by our social nature, *and* by our biological nature to develop virtues like loyalty, promise-keeping, courage, and practical wisdom. Furthermore, we vindicated the presumption that a special sort of deep happiness (contrasted with pleasure) is the natural, intrinsic result of the excellence or perfection of our nature (social, psychological, biological, etc.). We contrasted Foot’s theory which McDowell critiqued as “empirical naturalism”  with Stephen Brown’s similar theory and argued that Brown more justly falls under that condemnation than Foot. 
The recurring theme of these explorations has been what the Great Platitudes say about human nature as creatures in the broader cosmos. We saw with John McDowell how the fear of “spooky” metaphysics compels some to sharply distinguish human nature from nature as a whole; to transpose human “second nature” or culture on the vast, interlocking matrix of space-time and energy that is the dominant image of Laplacian nature. But McDowell’s brand of neo-Kantian idealism promises more than it delivers. When pushed, the dichotomy between nature / human nature collapses under the pressure of the absolute or unrestricted conception of nature and a restricted conception. McDowell wants nature to be restricted, but the line restricting it leaves mysterious everything outside nature. When he wants it unrestricted, then he cannot exclude (except by definitional fiat!) the supernatural entities or properties he is spooked by. The upshot is that McDowell’s theorizing is vulnerable to being ransacked by an Aristotelian realist (like myself) who plunders the realism while discarding the physicalism, anti-realism, or idealism. McDowell’s objections to such a plundering can in-principle contain no adequate rejoinders.

            <Title>### Relativism Objection</Title>
            <Text>### Objections ###

#### Relativism Objection ####

Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted by being called 'a giant' in Lilliput but 'a midget' in Brobdingnag; the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is pejoratively called a rationalist by the fideist and a fideist by the rationalists; he is called a progessive by traditionalists and a traditionalist by progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. 

The most recurring objection to MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy is a cluster of worries about relativism. Ironically, and perhaps comfortingly, he is accused of being too relativistic and of being not being enough of a relativist. 

Briefly put, the worry is this: MacIntyre's virtue, it seems, is relative to practices, to communities, to institutions, or to “rival versions of moral enquiry” — in a word, virtue is relative to traditions. It is entirely possible for traditions to be incommensurable with each other. Hence, it is possible for conceptions of virtue to be incommensurable with each other. 

Acceptance of a tradition entails acceptance of *a* particular definition of virtue and list of virtues; denial of a tradition (or denial of *tradition itself*) entails the rejection of any definition of virtue and list of virtues. In light of this interpretation of his ethical theory, all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that group consider to be virtues, not what virtues *actually are*. The inquirer interested in, say, which tradition is *correct* or which version of moral enquiry is *correct* is at a loss. Call this “tradition relativism” since it is different from cultural relativism or individualistic relativism. 

A charge of relativism, of course, only worries those philosophers (myself included) who think morality is in some sense "objective," binding, categorically obligatory, or universally prescriptive. Accusing a theory of relativism is only an “accusation” if relativism is false; relativists rejoice. Such are not my primary audience. I shall assume that relativism is false or at least an undesirable conclusion, and treat the charge of relativism as an accusation that needs to be refuted lest it destroy MacIntyre's theory. 

The relativist of morality (and what’s more, the relativist of rationality) is not my primary audience, so I shall assume that relativism is false or at least an undesirable conclusion, and treat the charge of relativism as an accusation that needs to be refuted lest it destroy MacIntyre's theory. 

How do we make sense of this objection? First we have to stipulate what "relativism" is. Fully defining the constellation of (sometimes conflicting) positions that fly under that heading is no small task. Instead of attempting to adjudicate them, I shall follow Stephn Lutz: “Relativism” is a conclusion of an enquiry to the effect that there are no truths free from contingent, historical conditions of the would-be knower.[@lutz2004tradition 66] To the relativist, the knower's individual or cultural perspective is both starting point and ending point of any enquiry. 

Now, MacIntyre denies relativism. Instead, he accepts the thesis that all of our inquiries, including our understanding of rationality itself, takes place within a cultural, historical, and traditional context. Following Lutz, we can say that MacIntyre accepts “relativity”.

Relativity (a term borrowed from Michael Krausz[@krausz1984relativism]) is a thesis about *the condition of enquiry.* It is not a thesis about the *conclusion of enquiry.* Lutz approves of Mark Colby's statement that "argumentative situatedness is inescapable."[@lutz2004tradition 89] 

Such relativity, such situatedness, is compatible with objective or absolute or mind-independent or tradition-independent *truth*. It is incompatible with an objective or absoltue or tradition-independent *rationality*. From the historically- and socially-situated position of enquiry, a philosopher (he argues) may indeed find truth. In my terms, our contingent social, cultural, and individiaul perspective is an alpha point of every enquiry but is not the omega point of every enquiry. 

We might represent the options in this graph: 

| |relative          |             absolute | 
| Liberal Modernity | | alpha  omega | |
| Nietzchean Postmodernity |    | alpha  omega |
| Thomistic tradition |                 alpha | omega |

#### Truth and rationality ####

The fundamental thesis behind MacIntyre's relativity is that truth is different from rationality. Truth is not simply "warranted assertability". It may be that the warranted assertion is (ultimately) false to reality, and it may be that what is asserted without warrant is (ultimately) true to reality. Truth is a matter of "adequation of the mind to the object." So adequation to the world as it is ultimately functions as a test of traditions. There are various rationalities; but admitting a plurality of rationalities does not necessitate admitting a plurality of truths. The plurality of rationalities can be "ranked" (though not of course by MacIntyre nor me) according to how adequately they capture the world as it is. 

MacIntyre's response is to distinguish between truth and rationality: 

&gt;Rationality, understood within some particular tradition with its own specific conceptual scheme and problematic, as it always has been and will be, nevertheless requires *qua* rationality a recognition of the rational inadequacies of that tradition from its own point of view may at any time proved to be such that perhaps only the resources provided by some quite alien tradition ... Will enable us to identify and to understand the limits of our own tradition; in this provision may require that we transfer our allegiance to that hitherto alien tradition... [T]he platonic distinction between "is true" and "seems true to such and such person" turns out within such traditions to survive the recognition of the truth in relativism.[@macintyre1985relativism 191]

But this is all pre-payment on a full response to the charge of relativism. Stating this charge adequately is important to both understanding and critiquing MacIntyre. I argue that several of his critics misunderstand the dialectic and criticize errors that *MacIntyre would agree are errors,* and errors he does not make. Others understand MacIntyre's position but are unwilling to join in the enquiry on the terms he lays out. Unwillingness to join an enquiry within which a theory is propounded is not, strictly speaking, an objection to that theory. 

#### Relativism Objection(s) ####

Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] Three of these are misunderstandings, three are justifiable questions that MacIntyre's theory, fully developed, can answer, and three are legitimate observations of the limits of MacIntyre's theory. Whether the identification amounts to a "critique" depends on whether those limits are *the actual limits* on enquiry. 

I shall briefly summarize Lutz' discussion of the first six criticisms before addressing more fully the last three. 

##### Feldmen #####

1. That of Susan Feldman[@feldman1986objectivity] misinterprets MacIntyre’s project as a failed and incoherent attempt to resolve factious, subjective ethical disputes by judging them from an abstract, objective, ideal observer. But MacIntyre never explicitly presents his theory as an ideal observer theory; rather, he explicitly denies it. The ideal observer would have to *begin* the enquiry from the view from nowhere, which is impossible for us. MacIntyre just is not building -- not even *attempting* to build -- a procedural meta-ethics with which to adjudicate otherwise intractable normative disagreements. 

#### Wachbroit ####

2. A second criticism is from Robet Wachbroit.  MacIntyre himself responded to Wachbroit in the second edition of *After Virtue*.[@wachbroit1984relativism] Wachbroit's worry is about the fundamental plurality of rationalities. He thinks MacIntyre faces a dilemma. Either MacIntyre himself writes from the view from nowhere, the Enlightenment objectivity, the archimedean point, or he writes from within the Aristotelian tradition. MacIntyre seems to get caught in this dilemma in sentences like these: "It scarcely needs repeating that it is the central thesis of *After Virtue* that the Aristotelian moral tradition is the best example we possess of a tradition whose adherents are entitled to a high measure of confidence in its epistemological and moral resources."[@@macintyre1984after 277] To whom does that 'we' refer? The dilemma, again, is that either 'we' are the Enlightened modern liberals or 'we' are the dyed-in-the-wool Aristotelians. On the first horn, if he writes from the view-from-nowhere, then MacIntyre is simply a modern meta-ethicist writing modern meta-ethics. He is criticizing liberalism from within the liberal tradition; he is borrowing the resources of the liberal definition of rationality to posit a theory in which no one definition of rationality has the resources to write books like *After Virtue*. On the second horn, if 'we' are card-carrying Aristotelians, it is trivial and almost tautologous to assert that 'we' take a high measure of confidence in Aristotelianism's epistemological and moral resources. Of course 'we' do! That kind of heady confidence that 'we' are up to standards arises within *each* tradition according to *that* tradition's own standards. 

Wachbroit misunderstands MacIntyre's theory ever so slightly here. MacIntyre can run through the horns of the dilemma. The 'we' need not be an ideal observer from a God's-eye point of view nor an Aristotelian already subsumed in the Aristotelian tradition. The 'we' can be those of us within broader western culture who have faced or might face the same kind of epistemological crisis that lead MacIntyre (and others) to critically evaluate the present state of western culture. The adherent of liberalism and the adherent of Aristotelianism share a common social, historical, and traditional root. Without too much difficulty, they can learn each other's conceptual vocabulary as a 'second language'. By self-reflecting upon the Enlightenment "branch" of the broader western tradition, and by facing up to its inadequacies and epistemological inconsistencies, the liberal adherent can test for him or herself whether the Aristotelian tradition has more resources for solving problems that are problems *by liberalism's own lights*. If, as MacIntyre did, such a person discovers that the Aristotelian has more resources for solving those problems, he or she might make rejoin with that older but no less thriving tradition. 

##### Colby Objection #####
3. Mark Colby misunderstands MacIntyre's project as an attempt to develop a new, objective criterion of truth that will solve the problem of epistemological crisis, regardless of one's tradition. On Colby's reading, MacIntyre is a kind of pragmatist, where the truth is just the conclusion of a certain sort of rational enquiry. But MacIntyre denies this. The test of a traditon's rationality is its adequation to reality. Lutz illustrates this with the example of astronomy. 

&gt; Ptolemaic astronomy lasted 1000 years because it solves a set of astronomical problems better than any of its opponents, including the heliocentric models of Aristarchus and Copernicus. Nevertheless, it did not adequately characterize the true nature of planetary motion and so under close evaluation it was plagued by inefficiencies that lead its adherents into a epistemological crisis. The theory that overcame Ptolemaic astronomy did so because it solved the astronomical problems or adequately than the Ptolemaic model, and it was confirmed by its predictive capacity. The fact that Kepler's astronomical model once subsumed into Newtonian physics, could predict novel facts provided confirmation that it was not only a clever description of a puzzling phenomenon, but a more adequate characterization of its object: the true nature of planetary motion.
&gt; what counts as progressiveness in the epistemological crisis resolution is improved adequacy to truths, but it pissed him logical crises only rise *within* traditions. Ptolemaic astronomers overcame *their* epistemological crisis when they abandoned *their own* geocentric beliefs Intertraditional considerations arise only when the adherents of one tradition are able to recongize in the resources of another tradition a more adequate solution to their own epistemological crisis. So progressiveness in epistemological crisis resolution cannot function as an intertraditional norm of rationality. This is no challenge to MacIntyre, however, because MacIntyre does not envision epistemological crisis as a tool for comparative ethics or meta-ethics.[@lutz2004tradition 91]

As I understand Lutz' point here, Colby is conflating the attempt of an inquirer *within* a tradition to resolve his or her epistemological crisis through examining the resources of a rival tradition with the attempt of an inquirier *outside* both traditions to resolve "epistemological crisis" per se by developing an intertraditional or trans-traditional criterion of adequacy. MacIntyre thinks the former is possible (and happens often) but that the latter is impossible. 

##### Roque Objection #####
4. Alicia Juarrero Roque surfaces another possible misinterpretation. MacIntyre claims that "comparison" between traditions is possible for an inquirer. But it is not possible by the attainment of an objective, context-free stance. Rather, each inquirier acquires a conceptual framework from his own tradition -- this is like a "first language." But each inquirer has the capacity to learn a "second first language". We can learn another conceptual framework philosophical imagination, through taking it *as if true* even before affirming it *as true*. Why do this? Usually because the inquirer's own tradition has failed him; he sees its inadequacies, he sees its problems and contradictions, he sees that it fails to live up to its own standards. MacIntyre describes what "rare gift of empathy" that this "philosophical imagination"[ makes possible: “…understand the theses, arguments, and concepts of their rival in such a way that they are able to view themselves from such an alien standpoint and to re-characterize their own beliefs in an appropriate manner from the alien perspective."[@macintyre1988whose 167]

Roque's worry is that the capacity for learning a second first language is an innate, rational capacity that *all people share.* If so, then belief in such a capacity contradicts the definition of tradition-constituted rationality. If not, then the absence of such a capacity renders tradition comparison impossible. MacIntyre's response is flatly to deny this interpretation of his work. The "capacity" to learn another tradition as a "second first language" is a "rare gift of empathy" and in no way part of a supposed bundle of innate capacities. This rebuttal does not make such a capacity unproblematic; we still might wonder whether, for an given inquirer, that inquirer's estimation that he possesses the gift of empathy and philosophical imagination isn't just a re-statement of the trivial thought, "I think I am right."


##### Evil practices #####

Virtues exist only in the context of practices. Yet some practices seem to be evil. 

MacIntyre's earlier theory cannot overcome this objection, Lutz argues. He says:

&gt;Unfortunately, the relativism of *After Virtue* cannot be overcome unless its definitions of the virtues are extended to embrace the Aristotelian and Thomistic doctrine of the unity of virtue. Macs rejection of the unity of virtue in *After Virtue* has grave implications for the rest of his virtue theory because the rejection of the unity of virtue divroces the intellectual moral virtue of prudence from the passional moral virtues of courage, temperence, and justice... Prudence becomes cleverness. Courage and temperance are relativized, so that one could reasonable speak of the virtue of courage in a Nazi... Likewise, justice is reduced to some notion of fairness.[@lutz2004tradition 98]

There have been ethical philosophers who endorse this kind of reductive virtue. Lutz mentions Edmund Pincoff as an "emotivist virtue theorist" (using "emotivist" in the narrower, MacIntyrean sense). Lutz continues by examining the implications of such a theory. Such a move has two main effects: (1) "It constitues the rejection of the Aristotelian practical syllogism that MacIntyre wanted to recover in *After Virtue* because it separates prudent reasoning from virtuous action. (2) It evacuates all falsifiable substantive moral content from the virtues, reducing them to enabling qualities."[@lutz2004tradition 100] The commonsense definition of "virtue" includes positive valence. A virtue is, within our tradition, a quality *admirable for its own sake* or else a quality that enables its bearer to *achieve admirable goals*. If a procedure results in a definition of virtue wherein even bad qualities or even good qualities that enable any given wicked goal, then the procedure has gone awry. 

In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, MacIntyre explicitly retracts his earlier belief that virtues exist without a unity under prudence.[@macintyre1988whose preface, p. x] The consequences of this retraction, Lutz argues, are wide-ranging and crucial to refuting the charge of relativism. If virtues are unified, then even though virtues exist only in the context of practices, "no genuine practice can be inherently evil."[@lutz2004tradition 102] Rather, practical reason can judge *apparent goods* as genuine goods. The qualities needed for achieving the spurious goods internal to that "practice" would not be virtues but only *apparent virtues*. Now, such a definition certainly seems ad hoc. But Lutz provides a persuasive illustration: eugenics. Eugenics certainly seems to bear the markings of a genuine practice. Its apparent good is the purification of the gene pool for future generations. However, genuine virtues militate *against* the achievement of that goal. For example, Lutz cites a story of a Nazi doctor who had the virtue of compassion found himself unable to pursue the program of euthanizing mentally-disabled children. Even the doctor seemed disappointed with himself, asserting that he "approve[d]" state measures with conviction" but was "too gentle for this work... Heil Hitler!"[@@poliakov1979harvest 186-7] We might also recall Huck Finn's internal struggle with his "conscience" in *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.[@twain2014adventures Chapter 31] 

Huck decides to turn Jim in to the slave owners. He writes a letter outing Jim, and feels much better after "repenting" of his theft: 

&gt;I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell...  

After vividly confronting Jim's humanity, his goodness, and their loyal friendship, he wavers. 

&gt;It was a difficult situation. I picked up the letter, and held it in my hand. I was trembling, because I knew had to make a choice between two things, and the outcome of my decision would last forever. I thought about it a minute while I held my breath. And then I said to myself: “All right, then, I’ll GO to hell"—and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

The humor of this passage arises, in large part, because of the tension between the *apparent good* of treating Jim as legal property and the *actual good* of treating Jim as an end in himself, as a free man just like any other. Huck's virtue (in this case, loyalty or friendship) *cannot* be put to use in the service of a corrupting practice like slave-trading. Just as vice subverts institutions and their worthy practices, virtue "subverts" vicious institutions and unworthy practices. Virtue marks the difference between the coward who disobeys his commanding officer's orders because the obedience would put him at risk of painful death and the courageous person who disobeys his commanding officer's order because obedience would require wrongdoing. Without prudence to discriminate between the two cases, we lack any resources by which to discriminate courage and cowardice, between a virtuous resistance and vicious resistance. 

MacIntyre's account satisfies two desideratum, which together form a paradoxical explanandum: his account explains why vices sometimes persist within pseudo-practices, institutions, and traditions from generation to generation, and it explains why practice-enabling virtues sometimes emerge to disrupt a pseudo-practice, a wicked institution, and a corrupt or at least incomplete tradition. The fact is that "many kinds of activities can be, and in fact are considered to be, practices. Some of these may conflict radically, owing to errors and insufficiences in rationlity."[@lutz2004tradition 103] Errors in rationality explain errors in traditions and hence misacriptions of the title 'virtue.' Rationality answers to truth, to the world as it is, not merely to the pragmatic reduction of truth to "dialectical success."[@lutz2004tradition 104] Hence, virtues answer to *what is really good*. They do not merely answer to "what-counts-as-good-for-us", which property is relative to each tradition. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes this iteration of the charge of relativism, while still explaining why rival traditions differ -- and sometimes radically differ -- in their evaluations and opinions. Incomplete traditions can, and do, undergo crisis. Particular persons within that tradition discover and perseverate on inadequacies within the tradition, leading to an epistemological crisis. In response, others within the same tradition may become willing to examine the resources of rival traditions and either quit their primary tradition or re-fashion it, re-make it, update it, and make real moral and intellectual progress. 

### J. L. A. Garcia ###

J. L. A. Garcia says that “MacIntyre’s rebuttal is as radical as it is ingenious. It is, in effect, to outrelativize the relativist. Rather than recoiling from relativism, as I understand his strategy, MacIntyre plunges so deeply into it, as we might say, to fall out the other side… Contrary to what he sees as the relativist’s hasty and facile assumption, MacIntyre insists that it is not necessarily (nor always) the case that everyone is so situated that there is no position whose adoption *by her* at *any* time would be rationally superiors to some particular *set* of alternatives…Now the tables are turned, and it is the relativist who appears the dogmatist, claiming to know in advance and *a priori* that no one can be so situated.” This all appears to me correct. MacIntyre uses the genealogist’s starting points to undercut the encyclopedist — a move which implicitly approves of moral relativism. But he doesn’t stop there; he uses all the resources of intellectual history and contemporary natural and social sciences to defend some (but not all) of the beliefs and values of modernity, such as the value of democracy, the value of university education, the value of history, the belief in the possibility of scientific truth, the belief in progress — a move which seems to endorse the Enlightenment and the liberal tradition as against the genealogists. To both, his challenge is to use the best resources of the past and the best rational resources of the present to defend a particular set of conclusions *as the best thus far*, as the *closest* to the truth. To both, his challenge is to defend a conception of morality and rationality *neither* claiming that any such conceptions are impossible *nor* claiming to have *concluded* the enquiry once and for all.

 ### Relativism Objection Conclusion  ###

    MacIntyre has responded to (and he thinks refuted) the charge of relativism multiple times, in his primary works and in “responses to critics.” Yet for many, relativism stains the image of MacIntyre. Even after clarifying the obscure points of the dialectic MacIntyre does endorse, the objection can be resolved but not finally refuted. I would like to offer a suggestion as to why this is so. Rather, the resolution of the criticism can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves; hence MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the enquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the enquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that enquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the enquiry.

Super Introduction
MacIntyre’s oeuvre may be seen as a response to the problem of disagreement in ethics. His response parallels in important ways (but also differs from) the response of Kuhn and Feyaraband to disagreement in natural sciences. MacIntyre was frustrated by his own and others’ failure to settle moral disagreements from within a settled version of moral inquiry, so he sought a way to stand outside rival versions of ethical inquiry. But even the metaethicists (like Moore) are examples of a version of moral inquiry rather than exceptions. So MacIntyre’s project might be cheekily described as meta-metaethics. 
The key works After Virtue, Whose Justice? Which Rationality?, and Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry tell a story about the history of ethics. That story has many facets, but the upshot is clear: (1) moral inquiry in particular, and practical rational activity in general, can only be done within the context of an embodied, social tradition. What is less clear is that (1) does not (MacIntyre insists) assume or imply relativism. Traditions can be wrong; paradigms can (and sometimes need to be) overturned; entire lines of inquiry can cohere more or less with themselves but fail to match the facts. 
Not surprisingly, then, MacIntyre thinks his tradition — Aristotelianism-Thomism — is right. Surprisingly, though, he thinks that members of rival traditions can (and should) look for and find the self-contradictions in their own tradition rather than simply evaluate the costs/benefits of “switching” clubs. The upshot for those who are persuaded by his arguments is not (as it is for Rorty) that “I am right that no one is right, so it doesn’t really matter if you disagree” or (as Harman) “I am right so you are right too.” The upshot for MacIntyre is “I am right, so you are wrong; but I can see why you think I am wrong and you are right; you should critique and judge your tradition by its own standards.”
The reason behind this somewhat surprising thought is that (thinking from within the perspective of my tradition) I will get a rival tradition’s putative costs and benefits all wrong. Rating X as a cost rather than a benefit is itself an item of my tradition. The rival tradition may rate X as a benefit rather than a cost. The only way to truly evaluate a rival tradition is to be motivated to engage in an act of “philosophical imagination,” to step into that tradition, if only hypothetically and imaginatively. To “feel my way around” in it. To try it on. But the motivation to try on another tradition is not common. That kind of motivation probably only springs from a deeply-felt dissatisfaction with one’s own tradition, which itself stems from the kind of (sadly rare) critical self-examination of one’s own tradition by its own standards. 
In this chapter, I shall re-tell some (but certainly not all) of the story that MacIntyre tells about modern moral philosophy, beginning with After Virtue. 
The moral of the story, for us, will be to draw from MacIntyre’s writing arguments:
1.  The first is the ineliminable and essential place of telos in both human psychology, virtue ethics, and human biology. The much maligned and much misunderstood term “teleology” is applied (not very controversially) to human end-directed behavior like planning a trip, giving a paper, playing sports, running for office, pursuing a mate, and so on; “teleology” is also applied (very controversially) to organic systems (the nervous system, the circulatory system), organs (the eye, the liver), organisms (deer, humans), animal behaviors (leaping, crying), animal “programs” (surviving, reproducing), and even to non-organic systems. “Global teleology” also refers to the notion (sometimes associated with magic or religion) that the cosmos as a whole is end-directed, with each part playing a role as instruments in an orchestra. MacIntyre’s early work defends the former use of teleology: human thought and practice are necessarily and essentially end-directed. But his later work (Dependent Rational Animals) defends even the much misunderstood possibility that biological or physiological natural systems and processes are end-directed, even absent the assumption of a deity. 
2. The second is the presumptive case for moral cognitivism and moral realism. The literature debating cognitivism and non-cognitivism is vast and intricate. The literature debating moral realisms and anti-realism (not to mention the literature debating the terms of the debate) is even more vast. We cannot hope, in this chapter, to engage of all it. But we can undermine some of the motivation that points us toward non-cognitivism in the first place. Metaethical non-cognitivism begins with a doubt about our moral discourse (especially doubts in the face of widespread, intractable moral disagreement).  MacIntyre in this chapter (and Foot in the next chapter) will give us some reason to doubt our doubts. Diagnosing the source of our (interminable, shrill) moral disagreement differently than Moore and Mackie, Ayer, Stevenson, Gibbard et. al., MacIntyre (and Foot) think that moral cognitivism arise as (defeasible) presumptions.  
We will build on these two planks to build our own virtue theory and foundation for virtue. 
Even as I keep these goals in mind, I must be sensitive to MacIntyre’s aims, structure, and style. 

Section Introduction After Virtue:
MacIntyre’s After Virtue is (for the first half) an inference to the best explanation. What is he trying to explain? The present chaos of moral theory and moral discourse in academia and in our broader culture. Because he is trying to explain a phenomenon so broad and loose, inevitably his book’s theorizing is large and loose. We must attempt to keep our summary within bounds. 
MacIntyre’s thesis in After Virtue seems impossible to summarize in one sentence. But I shall try. The thesis (as a first attempt) is: the Aristotelian tradition, defined in part by Aristotle and in part by “its own internal arguments and conflicts”MacIntyre, After Virtue 260. “can be restated in a way that restores intelligibility and rationality to our moral and social attitudes and commitments”MacIntyre, After Virtue 259. but that Nietzsche among others shows that its primary modern rival — the “liberal individualism” of Enlightenment thinkers  — cannot be given a “coherent rationally defensible statement.”</Text>

Any room for this comment from the IEP article on MacIntyre?

	MacIntyre’s latest work Chapter 7, “The Ends of Life, the Ends of Philosophical Writing,” treats philosophy as a professionalized outgrowth of the natural work of plain persons who struggle with ordinary questions about what it means to live well, or how laws have authority, or whether death has meaning (Tasks, p. 125). The literature of philosophy addresses questions like these, but whether philosophy can be fruitful for its reader depends on whether philosophers also engage those questions, or set the questions aside to focus on the literature of philosophy instead.

## The Myth of Morality

The φ is tapu is not a meaningless statement, but it is universally false. 

Joyce argues that all of morality is like that. 

“Moral discourse commits us to reasons-talk.” [@joyce2001myth 33] Institutional reasons are “legitimated by adherence to an institution.”[@joyce2001myth] The objective purport of morality is that they are not presented as institutional. They cannot be evaded. 

Practical rationality yields non-institutional reasons, for Joyce. It does not make sense to question why I should φ once I have granted that practical rationality says I should φ. 

Smith’s position is that “S is practically rational to the extent that she is guided by her subjective reasons, which in turn are understood as follows: S has a subjective reason to φ if and only if she is justified in believing that S+ would advise S to φ.”[@joyce2001myth 33] In other words, this formula does not allow S to be alienated from her practical reasons since they are by definitional fiat built into the meaning of practical rationality. 

The argument for moral error theory is that if someone is under moral obligation to do something, then that person ought to do that thing — has reasons to do that thing —  “regardless of whether [doing so] satisfies any of his desires or interests.” But “there is no sense to be made of such reasons”[@joyce2001myth 26] So someone is never under categorical moral obligation. 

Institutional reasons are “weak categorical” reasons, in that they are really hypothetical. They are categorical *only* for members of that institution. They are not “real reasons”; they can be ignored. 

Practical rationality is not just an institution. To question an institution is intelligible. To question practical rationality is to ask for a *reason* and hence to (implicitly) assume that practical rationality needs not be questioned.

            <Title>### Incoherence of the concept 'Tradition' and rationality Objection</Title>
            <Text>

#### Incoherence of the concept 'Tradition' and rationality Objection

The set of relativism objections and replies to them push us to articulate more clearly MacIntyre’s theory of rationality. Ethical reasoning is practical reasoning; and practical reason is a mode of *reasoning* per se, a mode of practical rationality in action. Living well depends on thinking well, though of course thinking well is merely necessary and not sufficient for living well. 

For this reason, the last objection Stephen Lutz discusses under the heading of “relativism” I shall discuss under the heading of “tradition-constituted rationality.” The objection is twofold: first, is MacIntyre’s concept of tradition-constituted rationality even coherent? Second, is it clear enough to be an indispensable feature of an ethical theory? 

 MacIntyre says on the one hand that, according to Tradition A, X is rational. According to Tradition B, X is not rational. They disagree and seem to genuinely disagree. A member of Tradition A can reasonably affirm that X cannot be both rational and irrational. Now, MacIntyre says that a member of Tradition B can discover some internal contradiction in Tradition B that makes her reconsider her tradition as aw hole. Perhaps she discovers that, according to Tradition B, Z is both rational and irrational. She is disconcerted by the contradiction. She decides to imaginatively entertain the possibility that Tradition A is more adequate and comes to see, over time, that Tradition A’s critique of Tradition B is compelling. The odd conclusion is this: affirming a contradiction is irrational for anyone in any Tradition. Now, I endorse this conclusion; if someone affirms a contradiction, and they persist in it in spite of repeated attempts to explain to them the contradiction, I would find them not just mistaken but fundamentally mentally impaired —  irrational. But the point is not whether the law of non-contradiction is true and a reliable criterion of rationality. The point is that MacIntyre cannot say so without contradicting himself. 

Suppose first that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational, while Tradition B teaches that logical contradictions can be rational. Then the member of Tradition B that affirms a contradiction (Z is both rational and irrational) will not, by her own standards, see a problem with her affirmation. A member of Tradition A will see the problem (by his own standards), but this is nothing surprising or new. The member of Tradition B has in principle no path out of her tradition, no motivation to see her tradition as mistaken, and hence no motivation to consider Tradition A. 

Suppose now that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational and Tradition B teaches the same. Now, according to MacIntyre, they agree (at least on this point) about a standard of rationality. They disagree about whether Z is rational or not, but they agree that Z cannot be both irrational and rational at the same time in the same respect. Are Tradition A and B now part of the same tradition, since they agree about the law of non-contradiction? Or are they different traditions, since they disagree about the rationality of Z? 

#### Incoherence of Tradition Objection Reply

I think it true that tradition influences our standards of rationality, justice, and virtue, but demonstrably false that it *constitutes* such standards. The law of non-contradiction is the counterexample. 

Every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction; every tradition denies rational agents the right to believe (P &amp; ~P). Any tradition that denies the law of non-contradiction, it seems to me, is an irrational tradition. And I don’t just intend to say it is irrational relative to my own standards of rationality, but that it is irrational full stop and possible to “step outside” my tradition far enough to see that. If there even does exist any person (such as Nagarjuna) or community or tradition that affirms (P &amp; ~P), we ought not interpret them as having a different standard of rationality but rather we ought to interpret them as believing that rationality is an obstacle to nirvana. Affirming contradictions is still irrational, but it is the kind of irrationality needed to do violence to the limits of rationality and transcend them. 

So I think MacIntyre’s unqualified claims about tradition constituting rationality should be limited to claims about other standards for acceptable kinds of evidence, etc.


#### Clarity — the Definition of tradition ####

A different angle to the same objection is the very definition of the term ‘tradition.’ Some readers, such as John Haldane, question MacIntyre’s ability coherently to identify what a tradition is. Call this the Differentiation Problem. Are two traditions separate and hence identifiable only if they are incommensurable? How much difference constitutes separation? How much overlap is compatible with difference? Jewish and Christian traditions share a common origin and bear considerable overlap in authorities, scriptures, and doctrines. 

MacIntyre’s definition makes such teasing out difficult. He characterizes a tradition as “separate and unified when its members or texts have a core set of shared commitments to beliefs, when the tradition is situated in a particular context in a particular set of institutions and when the tradition has an identifiable linguistic difference when compared to other traditions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 83] 

The response that Weinstein gives is this. We should not expect, by MacIntyre’s lights, that there is an automatically objective, view-from-nowhere by which we can define tradition itself. Rather, MacIntyre concludes that “the concept of a tradition, together with the criteria for its use and application, is itself one developed from within one particular tradition-based standpoint. This does not preclude its application to the very tradition within which it was developed.”[@horton1994after 295] This is liable to frustrate some readers. But the alternative (by MacIntyre’s lights) is intellectual imperialism wherein one tradition has the *real* scoop on every other tradition. MacIntyre grants that his self-definition of his own tradition arises, in part, from his criteria of that tradition. Traditions change over time. They progress (according to their own unchanging standards) toward unchanging goals or else they abandon old standards. 

I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. This may not satisfy critiques but it cordons off their objections. It pushes back, to demand that the critics self-reflect and specify their own tradition (in MacIntyre’s words) even as they demand a definition of the term ‘tradition’ (in their own words). 


#### Justification of Morality Objection #### 

I would like to expand this objection by appeal to a slightly different one. I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection. He points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*, which I shall discuss in a later chapter.

// Will I discuss it in a later chapter? If not remove that sentence. 

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is this: the question “why be moral?” is never asked in the abstract. Philosophers often pose the “why be moral?” question hypothetically, as if they were skeptics of one or another sort. But such an idealized moral skeptic will not do. And a non-hypothetical, non-idealized skeptic faces a problem, on MacIntyre’s theory. 

That problem is that if they are full-fledged members of their tradition, the “why be moral?” question usually does not arise. There are two exceptions: The first when persons who succeed in sincerely asking the “why be moral?” question who are, by definition, outcasts from their own society. The emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The *polis* to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the *polis* which belongs to him. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” simply do not arise. 

In drawing the distinction between the modern "emotivist self" and the "self of the heroic age" MacIntyre says, “In heroic society there is no 'outside except that of the stranger. A man who tried to withdraw himself from his given position in heroic society would be engaged in the enterprise of trying to make himself disappear.”[@macintyre1984after 126] In one sense, MacIntyre *dissolves* this worry. His strategy is not to give the skeptical “why be moral?” question the devil’s due and solve it on its own conditions; his strategy is to undermine the conditions of asking it. 



The second exception is when moral skeptics *are* members of their own tradition but are seeing the problems within their own tradition and are troubled by a “border tradition”. This skeptic sees the resources of a rival tradition and compares such favorably with the resources of his own tradition. He is, in a word, entering epistemological crisis. And to such a skeptic, MacIntyre’s theory invites him or her to do the hard work of resolving that crisis by examining, from within the context of a primary tradition *and* a “second first” tradition, the problems at hand and the available solutions, working toward an ever greater understanding of the truth. 

For this reason, again, I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. </Text>

            <Title>### MacIntyre's Audience </Title>
            <Text>### MacIntyre's Audience ###

MacIntyre's work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. Most broadly, on the one hand, defenders of what MacIntyre lumps together as "modernity" or "modern liberalism" object to the historical narrative by which they (all!) get somehow lumped together by a single (quite despairing) diagnosis of unintelligibility. On the other hand, even critics of modernity who accept his diagnosis might dispute the prognosis. For example, even Thomists such as Robert P. George and John Haldane with whom he ostensibly shares a philosophical school dispute his Thomism. Since I am not a Thomist I shall not dig deep into these worries. 

By far the largest group of professional philosophers belong to one or the other of the two remaining rival versions of moral inquiry. And professional philosophers, of which he is a quite successful, may be tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy. (I treat 'success' here as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) "A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."[@hauerwas2007]

The three rival versions of moral inquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. But "Encyclopedists" dispute his historicism and the implied relativism of ethical theory. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, non-perspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality. 

And (somewhat ironically) relativists like Gilbert Harman reject his moral realism. These think that his emphasis on traditions is well-taken, and that he should not therefore try to extricate any universal moral truths. 

"Genealogists" and postmodern philosophers agree with his critique of liberalism but reject his solution. They agree that our choice is between Nietzsche or Aristotle but choose Nietzsche over Aristotle. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

But I think to concede this is to give up on ethics as philosophy -- and perhaps to give up on philosophy as a whole. If it were true, I would have to stop writing now. 

Another critique comes from quite opposite quarters. The genealogist, the postmodern philosopher, the Nietzschean pessimist accepts MacIntyre’s critique of modernity but critique his project of *restoring* modernity via the tradition of Aristotle, virtue, and Thomas Aquinas.  The encyclopedist, the modern philosopher, the rationalist optimist denies MacIntyre’s alpha and accepts his omega; these skeptics accept MacIntyre’s alpha but deny his omega. Tradition and history rule all, and there is no escaping their tyranny. But MacIntyre thinks that just because we are born into the tyrannical kingdom doesn’t mean we can never leave. 

The encyclopedist thinks we are born free. The genealogist thinks we are born slaves. MacIntyre thinks we are born slaves but we can get free. 


It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

I shall divide them into critiques from modernity and from postmodernity. These are very different critiques! </Text>

            <Title>### No need for telos</Title>
            <Text>### Metaphysical Biology Objection.** ###

A third major objection needs to be surfaced here. It is this: Perhaps virtue ethics, morality, and rationality do not need to be teleological. 

MacIntyre's whole ethical case is built on the recovery of telos. Without telos, he argues, there can be no virtue. The reply to such a case from a genealogist like Sartre is that there is no telos and therefore indeed there is no virtue, no one coherent narrative to human life, and no objective morality. But the reply from an encyclopedist is that we can get along just fine without teleology. 

MacIntyre himself rejected Aristotle's "metaphysical biology" in *After Virtue*. He later changed his mind on this point. But critics might worry that the notion of social teleology is too bound up with discredited pre-modern notions about nature. 


#### No Need for Telos Objection

It seems that morality (not to mention politics and society) can get along well without teleology. To make good on what is possible, one must simply furnish an example of what is actual. To make good on the usefulness and adequacy of a non-teleological ethics, one simply needs to furnish such an ethics. Two broad schools of thought take themselves to supply such an ethics: the Kantian deontologists and the consequentialists. 

Objection 1. It seems that the moral law *by itself* tells us what actions are wrong or not wrong. @korsgaard1996authority argues that the autonomous moral law delivers judgments -- and generates categorical obligations -- without regard to teleology. These duties or laws are generated by our *practical identity*. That is, there are some actions that violate my practical identities. Trivially, if I call myself a baker I must bake things. If I refuse to bake I disintegrate that practical identity. Though she does not say it like this, I would state that identities are *functional concepts.* To be a farmer is in some sense to *do what farmers do*. To be a sea captain, or a teacher, or a father, is to *perform the functions* prescribed by or definitionally built into those concepts. Even if the exact limits and boundaries of a functional concept are sometimes fuzzy or flexible, they are still intelligible. Now, my first and fundamental practical identity is that of human being.[@korsgaard1996authority] I simply must value my own humanity if I am to value anything at all. And I do value things; therefore, I do value my own humanity. Anyone who values anything values their own humanity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 

Objection 2. It seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of telos. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). 


### Telos reply 

On the other hand, however, these modern moralities are either covertly teleological or they are incoherent. 

First, as MacIntyre has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without telos becomes unintelligible. A society that highly values some virtue (say, chastity) but does so only out of habit --  without any wisp of certain knowledge about the effect chastity has on a man or woman's whole life --  will not long retain that high opinion. Chastity as a white-knuckle fiat not to engage in sexual intercourse with anyone other than one's opposite-sex spouse is simply too difficult, psychologically and morally, to seem valuable to someone who has no clue why chastity is so good for us, and why sexual license is so disastrous for humans, families, and societies. 

### Telos and virtue (and life, and self) are an organic whole ##

If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover telos. That is, we must discover or re-discover the organic holism of the narrative unity of my life, my identity and self-concept, the telos of human life as a species and my own specific telos as a member of that species, and the virtues that are the qualities that enable me to achieve my telos. Not one of these parts can be left out of the whole. 

The second option is that teleology is smuggled in. Charles Taylor argues this point persuasively.[@taylor] We do not need to take the point on authority. We can rediscover it ourselves rather quickly. 

As a sample for review, examine Kantian deontology and its base-line foundation: Kant famously pronounced: "Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of it, which can be called good, without qualification, except a good will."[@kantgroundwork] This is the first principle of Kantianism: the categorical imperative, the value of humanity, the value of autonomy, the identification of a will that obeys the categorical imperative with 'the good will'.  The good will is good because it follows the good law; the law of autonomy (all other laws being heteronomous); the categorical imperative is the unconditional obligation on all practically rational beings whatsoever to treat other rational beings as ends in themselves, others being equally autonomous, others being equally human and therefore equally valuable. This is all very consistent. 

But why are humans valuable? Kant can give no answer to this. It is his own emotive assertion. 

Take any other modern moral philosophy such as Humean sentimentalism, utilitarian consequentialism, psychological egoism or contractarianism. Consider its base-line foundation, its summum bonum, its first principle, its Great Platitude, and you will discover the same baseless base, the same groundless assumption. 

For Humean sentimentalism the first principle is the relation between the good and my affections. "To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to feel a satisfaction of particular kind from the contemplation of a character." (*Treatise of Human Nature* 471)

For contractarianism it is the value of keeping promises. "The moral theory of contractarianism claims that moral norms derive their normative force from the idea of contract or mutual agreement." But such a value is a western prejudice.

&gt;Contracts require independent agents who are able to make and carry out promises without the aid of others. Historically, while white men have been treated as these pure wills of contract theory, Blacks and women have been treated as anti-will: dependent and irrational. Both ideals are false; whole people, she says, are dependent on other whole people. But by defining some as contractors and others as incapable of contract, whole classes of people can be excluded from the realm of justice. This point has been explored by other critics of contractarianism, first by Allen Buchanan (1993) and more recently by Eva Kittay (1999), who points out that not only are dependents such as children and disabled people left out of consideration by contractarian theories, but their caretakers' needs and interests will tend to be underestimated in the contract, as well.[@sepcontractarianism]

For consequentialism it is the value of happiness or pleasure. All that Mill can say to the inquirer who wants to hear about *why* happiness is desirable is that people desire it.

&gt;It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?
&gt;Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfill -- to make good its claim to be believed?
&gt;The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.[@mill chapter 4, "Of what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible"]

This kind of hand-waving does not inspire the confidence of eudaimonist virtue theorists who think that the "proof" of the principle of eudaimonia is "susceptible" of something much more robust. 

Reply to Objection 1. Korsgaard's point here is not far off from MacIntyre's (nor, I assume, far from Sandel's or any other communitarian's). Her thesis is that a moral identity qua practical identity is fundamental and supports other practical identities (like son, brother, citizen, teacher). Insofar as human nature is a real thing, MacIntyre can agree that humanity is a functional concept. If I am to be human, there are some deeds I must do. MacIntyre (and, I presume, other communitarians) would simply query whether I can discover my identity qua human before discovering it qua American or member of the Buhler family or "westerner". What is deepest metaphysically is last epistemologically. MacIntyre might argue that Korsgaard cannot discover her identity qua human without her western education, without reading Kant, without the benefit of being a part of the Enlightenment tradition. Korsgaard takes for granted her identity as a westerner and falsely construes that particular identity -- invisible to her -- as *the* universal human identity. Would Christine Korsgaard, the particular human being, have the same belief about human identity if she were raised not in the U. S. but in the E. U. or the U. A. E. in a different moral tradition? 

Reply to Objection 2. Consequences may be "external" or "internal." That is, consequences of an action may be non-natural or natural. The oxygenation of the blood is a natural consequence of breathing. Our biological make-up determines that the act of breathing and the oxygenation of the blood an organic whole. A natural consequence of holding your breath is a build up of carbon dioxide. Winning a world record for holding your breath underwater is a non-natural consequence of holding your breath. Consequentialists either do not distinguish between the two or are explicit that there are no ends or consequences related internally or naturally with some means. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;But before proceeding to this discussion I propose, first, to deal with the third kind of ethical question—the question: What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalization. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. Good effects Moore argues are aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships. Strangely enough, the same Moore defines the necessary relation between parts and a whole as an "organic whole" or "organic unity." But he sees no organic unity between (some) means and their ends. Some means are partially constitutive of their ends. We might say that the *means* and the *end* form in that instance an organic whole. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constitutive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species gorilla gorilla as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics. 

The problem here is inconsistency and self-deception. The modern tradition, the “traditionless-tradition” either helps itself to Aristotelian telos while vehemently denying it, or (if honest) collapses into the “truthless-tradition” of postmodernity. 

#### Ends/means Objection. ####

I said above that the refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. Charles Taylor endorses the notion that “the place accorded the virtues [is] a kind of litmus test for discriminating Aristotelian from modern ethical theory.”[@taylor 25]

What could this mean? Behind the means/end distinction is a peculiarly modern assumption that formal and final causes are either not related or not *necessarily* related. There are various ways of cashing out this distinction. In biology, it is the distinction between form and function.[@huneman2006naturalising] In engineering it is the distinction between design and operation.



### Even if there were no natural teloi, human action is teleological

MacIntyre has a powerful response to this objection. It is, I think, satisfying. And that is that the conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology can be side-stepped. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups (the Republican or Democratic Party, the YMCA, the U.S.A., the Parent Teacher Association, Starbucks) is end-directed actions and practices. That is enough. Call it "social teleology." 

Christine Korsgaard has defended the notion of practical reason as the faculty we discover in ourselves *after* we are already acting in the world and reflecting upon our actions.[@korsgaard1996authority] It is not really up for debate that we are reflective creatures; everyone reading this is capable of reflecting on their actions, asking for and providing *reasons* for action that may or may not justify the action. This is close, I think, to MacIntyre's way of thinking. 

Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. Telos can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With telos firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether telos exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

### Human action is teleological

One thesis I would like to extract, develop, and defend is this: human practices are necessarily end-directed (teleological). “Social teleology” has at least two and possibly three aspects: individual, collective, and human. The first aspect of social teleology is the end-directed behavior of each agent; the second is the end-directed behavior of social groups, like families, nations, clubs, congregations, and so on. The third, and most objectionable, aspect, is the end-directed activity of our species as a whole. What, if anything, does every human being intentionally pursue? 

The answer to this question is bound to be controversial. But before we try to answer it we can pause and point out that MacIntyre has made the question intelligible and urgent. 

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. And if it is correct, it demands the re-evaluation of some cherished assumptions. 

In sum, the rebuttal of the “no need for teleology” objection is twofold: first, if the sort of teleology needed is merely social or anthropological, then that sort of teleology is defensible. Secondly, the alternative — a purely formal ethics allegedly sanitized from notions of final causation, intrinsic ends, natural purposes — is not actually an alternative to teleological ethics because it turns out to be covertly teleological in the end. 

If these rebuttals are in the right vein, then one of MacIntyre’s key points from *After Virtue*, *Whose Justice?*, and *Dependent Rational Animals* emerges as a shining light. That is, human life is teleological, and so the attempt to construct anti-teleological systems is impossible and the endeavor to conduct ourselves according to anti-teleological ethics is futile. 

Such a conclusion may be taken as quite dire. Or it may be invigorate optimism. Ethics, reinvigorated with teleology, might just be able to escape some of its modern quandaries. And not only ethics. Law, political philosophy, and applied disciplines like politics itself, rhetoric and debate, social philosophy, and others disciplines are given new promise and new hope. </Text>

            <Title>### Why virtue ethics</Title>
            <Text>### Why virtue ethics?

My approach to philosophical ethics is to study virtue ethicists and to explore virtue and related concepts like practical reason and happiness. 

A reasonable question to respond to right away is this: Why write about virtue? Why study virtue ethicists? I have two answers: one sociological and general, the other psychological and personal. 

The sociological answer first: In the last 60 years or so, “virtue ethics” broadly construed has garnered the support of a remarkably high percentage of analytic philosophers.[@chalmers2014philosophers. This survey shows that roughly the same amount of analytic philosophers adhere to "virtue ethics" as adhere to deontology (about 1/5th).] 

There are various interpretations of this revival. One is that many philosophers have become profoundly dissatisfied with modern moral philosophy. (Alasdair MacIntyre represents this view.) On this reading, Aristotle and Confucius provide refreshing alternatives to the stolid, dry, rationalism of Kant or Mill.

But one of our most prestigious living virtue ethicists, Rosalind Hursthouse, disputes this interpretation. Virtue ethics, she thinks, presented itself as a rival during the early fledgling efforts to win a place at the table of modern moral philosophy; now that it *has* a place, such a presentation is needlessly combative. 

A second interpretation of the surprising renaissance of virtue ethics is that virtue concepts are potent and flexible. That is, virtue concepts can be systematized into coherent, stable, theories of their own. But they can also can enrich deontological and utilitarian and contractarian theories.  In fact, they can even help non-philosophers (such as college undergraduate) to avoid damaging vices and live well. The question "How do I live well? What is a beautiful life for me?" is, arguably, not an optional one but an inescapable question that arises for every person that survives to adulthood. 

My own view is that both of these interpretations of the revival of contemporary virtue ethics capture an important truth. On the one hand, those who study virtue ethics can indeed achieve an excellent position from which to critique modern moral philosophy. Long familiarity with cultures, places, and times different from one's own has the salubrious effect of opening one's eyes to one's own culture and time. The philosopher conversant with Aristotle or Aquinas likely to notice and articulate modern assumptions or biases that are invisible to those of us who live in modernity. 

At the same time, it is not a foregone conclusion that contemporary virtue ethicist will *reject* widespread modern assumptions. Some, such as Murdoch and MacIntyre, did become staunch opponents of modernity. Some, such as McDowell and Hursthouse, become staunch defenders, even while working to enrich modernity with pre-modern tradition. 

Throughout these investigations, I consider both possibilities. By taking a broader historical perspective, some virtue ethicists find in ancient and medieval philosophers a refreshing relief from the hidebound modern assumptions; others find in them an invigorating resource for advancing progress upon modern assumptions.

The personal answer: Although I was raised in a household of strict morals, it was not until I was introduced (in undergraduate days) to the concept of virtue as a live and practical moral concept. What struck me then, as now, was the connection between virtue and *eudaimonia*, between goodness and happiness, between the individual's good and the public good, between the flourishing of one person and the thriving of the community. Human beings are not (like ants) parts of a collective, beholden to the hive for food and safety; nor are human beings (like Homer's Cyclops) *radically individual* loners, isolated from all neighbors. Rather, in the famous words of St. Paul, "we, being many, are one body... and every one members one of another" (Rom 12.5). The crucial metaphor that illuminates morality is not the legal but the organic. Virtue concepts are organic. They are often praised (and *criticized*) for being "uncodifiable”.[See @mcdowell1979virtue for a discussion of the “uncodifiability” nature of deductive *and* practical reason, which discussion owes much to Wittgenstein.] Virtue concepts are practical, flexible, sometimes fuzzy -- just like every useful concept. Since being introduced to the older tradition of living virtuously in order to thrive and be happy, and since introducing others likewise, these concepts and the tradition they enrich has come to seem as natural as breathing and as necessary. 

### Some themes
In consequence of the revival of virtue ethics, there are many lively and interesting controversies on the main stage as well as some fascinating sideshows. Though consensus around the answers is still forthcoming, a set of thematic questions emerge: 

1. First and foremost, what exactly *is* virtue (and its opposite, vice)? There are many accounts of virtue. Are they compatible or are there some  that are more plausible? 
2. Since Aristotle's writings, virtues have often been thought to play a special role in making the virtuous agent *happy* (eudaemonia, flourishing, thriving, well off, etc.).[Cf. @annas2011intelligent] But Bentham and Nietzsche mock this alleged role. Is there any inherent relation between virtue and happiness? If so, are virtues necessary for happiness (as Foot thinks) or necessary *and sufficient* for happiness (as McDowell thinks)? 
3. Several conceptions of virtue (following Aristotle) have set eudamonia as the “function” of humanity, its purpose or telos. Does it make sense to speak of a *human function*? If so, just what is it? And how does it relate to our unique attributes, like higher rationality, self-awareness, and language?  @brown2008 accepts natural final causality but rejects eudaimonia, preferring to speak in Darwinian terms about our purpose as repruduction, while @hursthouse1999 speaks about four "characteristically human ends" including but not limited to reproduction. 
4. Relatedly, if virtue is sufficient for happiness, does that mean that the life lived in pursuit of virtues and avoidance of vices is a life of shameless egoism?[Cf. @annas2009; @huang2010self] 
5. Another traditional notion defines virtues as those traits by which one becomes *fully human* or actualizes human nature. (Human nature is something like a set of properties or capacities common to all humans -- at least all non-defective humans. Human nature has been thought to include such essential properties as practical rationality, or rationality in general, language, social consciousness, self-consciousness, or genetic and other environmental/cultural properties.) Talk of a fixed "human nature" implies that an agent's humanity is in one sense a *given* to be discovered, while in another sense it is a goal to be achieved. One of the most persistent and widespread objections to this conception of virtue is that it seems to depend on discredited Aristotelian metaphysical picture of human nature.
6. Even if we could expound and defend a realistic concept of human nature, would basing ethical conclusions on metaphysical or psychological premises commit Moore’s so-called "naturalistic fallacy"? How do we proceed from a premise about *the way human nature is* to the specific normative conclusion such as *humans ought to keep their promises*?
2. Furthermore, there are skeptical worries to the effect that there are no habitual characteristics or acquired traits such as virtues and vices are supposed to be.[@harman2009skepticism] Do virtues and vices qua stable character traits even exist? Or if they exist, do they matter enough to make theorizing about virtue even interesting?[@kamtekar2004situationism]
3. There is a growing body of literature on the theme of intellectual (rather than merely moral) virtues.[Cf. @zagzebski1996virtues;  @bloomfield2000virtue] Some think practical wisdom (or phronesis) is one virtue among many, while others think it the master virtue that unifies both practical and intellectual. Are all virtues practical or are some theoretical? 
9. Finally, there are more abstract or foundational questions such as how (if at all) might an ethical theory built on virtue concepts defend the claim of objective moral knowledge? And what does ‘objective’ mean? I have been helped in the clarification of this term by an old but extremely perspicuous article by @sellars1927naturalism, the father of Wilfred Sellars.

The five key virtue ethicists listed above address some or all of these questions. Since our focus must be limited somehow, I try to remain attentive to the primary themes of my project while commenting briefly or at least acknowledging some of the key general questions that interest virtue ethicists.

            <Title>Little, Margaret</Title>
            <Text>Margaret Little, “Seeing and Caring: The Role of Affect in Feminist Moral Epistemology” in Foundations of Ethics, ed. Shafer-Landau, Cuneo, Blackwell 
On the majority view, “to be objective is to be detached; to be clear-sighted is to achieve distance; to be careful in deliberation is to be cool and calm” (420). 

Men are associated throughout history with reason and women with affect (Lloyd 1979, 1983, McMillan 1982, Tuana 1992). [See also Flight from Woman by Karl Stern]. These roles are seen by Enlightenment thinkers especially as complementary but sharply bifurcated. 

Affect is necessary for identifying the “salient features of the situation (that one’s neighbor is in pain, for instance)” (422). Seeing is itself a task (423). It’s not just seeing what is there, but seeing the significance of what is there, that is called for. We have to care for the person themselves (424). Without the affect (with instead dispassion) we are less likely to “pick up on what is morally salient” (425). 

But is that enough? Is the “detached ‘point of view of the universe’” more important? Is affect just a helpmeet? Moral awareness involves not just noticing pain but ascending to “conceptualize a situation in moral terms... to see it as meriting some response” (425). We do not immediately respond, do not always respond, of course (426). 

This is a response to the skeptical charge about practical irrationality — someone who sees what needs to be done but doesn’t do it, doesn’t even feel motivated to do it (427). Like being able to identify green by wavelength spectrometry but not by sight. But moral properties have no isomorphic subvenient bases, like color (428). So “Affect... has an ineliminable role in moral epistemology” (428). 

“The traditional partition of reason and affect shows up in one final and very important way in discussions of morality. Historically, many who have granted morality’s intimate connection with affect have concluded that the connection comes at a price: it reveals that there are in fact no moral properties or moral truths. Philosophers from Hume to Mackie have argued that the necessary connection of a moral verdict to affect gives us in principle and ex ante reason, in advance of any substantive investigation into moral systems, for concluding that those claims do not correspond to the way the world is” (428). 

Like desires, emotions seem to have the wrong mental-state-to-world fit. But some desires do have a desire-to-world fit.

            <Title>## Section I: Excellence in Being For the Good</Title>
            <Text>Adams’ theory of virtue builds, in some ways, on his metaethical theory in Finite and Infinite Goods. 

For Adams, to be virtuous is to be for the good. ‘Being for’ is to be understood as a dispositional attitude, a stance, a direction, an overall disposition. But one can fail to be for the good in the proper way. Hence, to be virtuous is to be excellent in being for the good. 

Adams criticizes but builds upon the views of Thomas Hurka (2001 %). For Hurka, virtues are higher-level intrinsic goods involving morally appropriate attitudes to other (independent) goods or evils. Hurka is a virtue consequentialist. He notes that on one view virtue is a “disposition to produce what is otherwise good or to do what is otherwise right” (call these primary goods) in which case virtue is of only “derivative and instrumental significance.” (2001, 3%). On the contrary view, however, virtue is itself a primary good. On such a view, good and right are goods only derivatively.  Hurka’s account is “intermediate between these extremes” (2001, 3 %). Hurka’s account is not a rival to consequentialism but “satisfies consequentialist assumptions” while giving an account of the intrinsic goodness of virtue and intrinsic badness of vice (2001, 4).

            <Title>Context of Ethics and Metaethics</Title>
            <Text>Ethical Context
Philosophical ethics aims to “identify, articulate, and defend general moral principles that serve to explain when and why various types of action, institutions, or characters count as right or wrong, just or unjust, virtuous or vicious…[assuming, of course, that] there is a general and principled account of morality to be given.” (Sayre-McCord 2014).  
Modern moral philosophies (defining “modern” as Enlightenment secular moralities) that do not debunk morality entirely have tended to be either Kantian or Utilitarian. So, for a Kantian deontologist, some one or few principles of pure practical reason provide categorical normative obligation to do some actions (e.g., always treat other moral agents as ends in themselves, never merely as a means to an end). For a Millian utilitarian consequentialist, the one moral principle is to maximize happiness. Act-utilitarians recommend that the hedonic calculus, at least in theory, be applied to each act; rule-utilitarians only that it be applied to general types of action. 
All three of these philosophical ethics may be contrasted with non-philosophical (or non-systematic) ethics, with “folk morality” or “common morality,” (Beauchamp and Childress). Common morality, it is claimed, is a superficial but nigh-universal set of moral precepts, hunches, intuitions, commitments, and beliefs that are surprisingly widespread and trans-cultural. Items of the common morality include a “primal platitudes” like keeping one’s promises, not murdering, honoring elders, doing good, and so on. (Some ethical philosophers defend non-systematic ethics [Chappell 2009; Chappell 2014]). 
John Arras says: “Normative ethical theories vary considerably in terms of their aspirations towards generalization, universality, abstractness, systematic organization, simplicity, and comprehensiveness (Nussbaum 2000, Flynn 2007). Paradigmatic examples of what we'll call “high moral theory” attempt to embody most or all of these defining characteristics. Thus classical utilitarianism, Kantian deontology, and Rawlsian justice as fairness, for example, all strive for the articulation of a theoretical system based upon a small number of abstract fundamental principles (e.g., Mill's principle of utility, Kant's categorical imperative, and Rawls's famous two principles of justice) that they regard as the “keys” to understanding the moral or political life. These principles in their pristine incarnations are capable of being articulated in a perfectly general and universal fashion without any reference to or dependency upon any particular social practices or cultural norms. They apply, so their authors tell us, to all rational agents as such.[14] Beginning from these highly abstract and universally binding moral norms, standard examples of high moral theory ramify into complex systems encompassing basic and derivative moral principles (e.g., respect the autonomy of rational agents), rules based upon such principles (e.g., do not enlist patients in biomedical research without first gaining their informed consent), and, finally, judgments animated by such principles and rules bearing on particular cases (e.g., the Tuskegee syphilis study was unethical).
Although most philosophers might naturally think of such highly abstract and ambitious constructions as paradigmatic examples of moral theory, and most likely have precisely such theories in mind when asked about the relationships between bioethics and ethical theory, they do not exhaust the space of normative theorizing either in bioethics or within the moral life more generally.” (John Arras, “Theory and Bioethics”, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N.

Virtue ethics is a nice combination of philosophical and common morality (Annas 2011). 	My account is an attempt to strike a balance between high and common. Such attempts are fraught with danger. The high aims for truth, systematicity, simplicity, elegance; the common aims for usefulness, practicality, complexity to match the rough and tumble of situational ethics, and ruggedness. These two sets of aims are either incompatible or only compatible barely. 
Virtue ethics is a commonly seen as alternative to and rival of Kantianism and consequentialism. So for a virtue ethicist, the most general principle is that one should always do whatever the (ideally) virtuous agent would do (Hursthouse 1999). 
In contrast to the picture of virtue ethics as a distinct and competing rival, some have argued that virtue talk can be combined with another modern moral philosophy to create a “virtue theory”. So virtue ethicists can be consequentialists (Hurka 2001). Virtues are those traits that contribute to the best overall consequences. Or virtue ethicists can be deontologists: virtues are those traits that enable us to do our duty, or doing our duty builds in us virtues. 
Finally, we can contrast modern secular moralities with religious moralities. I call a morality religious if it is wholly or partially rooted in a sacred text, or sees divine commands as inherently binding. Virtue ethics has been appropriated by various religious moralities, but has also been at home in a variety of weltenshuaangs, from deistic or pantheistic to secular and atheistic. While the philosophical virtue ethics I shall be defending is ecumenical with regard to atheism and theism, I shall return to the metaphilosophical issue of theism in the last chapters. 

Metaethical Context
We must also say a few words about the metaethical context of philosophical ethics. 
Metaethics is the branch of ethics that examines the foundations of “moral talk, thought, and practice” (Sayre-McCord 2014). We might follow Mark Schrader in dividing metaethical topics according to the relation of moral topics to the “core questions” of philosophy: metaphysics, anthropology, epistemology, semantics, (and I would add, metaphilosophy). 
The question in moral metaphysics is whether moral facts are real or not? If not, then either some brand of constructivism is true or nihilism (Mackie 1973). If so, then moral realism is true (Shafer-Landau 2006). Virtue ethicists tend to be moral realists. But some argument is obviously needed to establish the thesis that there are moral facts about which moral discourse can (and often does) denote.
A further question in moral metaphysics is, if there are moral facts and moral truths, whether they are brute facts or underwritten by some further (non-moral) fact? This is the question of constructivism. If they are brute facts, then this is what Shafer-Landau (2006) calls  “stance-independent” moral realism since the moral facts do not depend for their reality on the beliefs or attitudes of any actual or ideal moral agent or group (Wielenburg 2009; Nagel 2012). If moral facts do so depend, we have one of many kinds of stance-dependent constructivism, either an ideal agent (Hursthouse 1999), an ideal group (Rawls 1971; Railton 1986; Harman 1975; Copp 1995), an actual agent (Lenman 2010), pure practical reason itself (Korsgaard 1986), or any two or more agents who agree with each other in an explicit or implicit contract (Scanlon 1998).
The question of constructivism is crucial within the debate over neo-Aristotelian metaethical accounts of virtue. Hursthouse considers herself a realist; by Shafer-Landau’s lights, she is an anti-realist. “[C]onstructivism in ethics is the view that there are normative truths about what one ought to do, but they depend on how rational agents would reason in an idealized deliberative situation” (Bagnoli 2011). “Realists agree that (a) moral discourse shares the same semantics as non-moral discourse, (b) there are moral properties, such as rightness, (c) moral properties are sometimes instantiated, and (d) moral predicates express properties. But there is a disagreement whether in order to be a form of realism, a theory must hold a stronger claim that (e) moral properties and moral relations are “mind-independent” (Dancy 1986).” (Bagnoli 2011) We must first ask whether such distinctions are merely stipulative. If so, we can note the substantive agreement and dispense with labels. If not, though, we must enter the details of the disagreement about whether moral facts are brute facts or grounded in a deeper (non-moral) fact (as Hursthouse argues), like the judgment of a fully virtuous agent. In this, Hursthouse claims to be following Aristotle who defines the good life in terms of virtuous rational agency (Nicomachean Ethics, V, 1 1129b2-7, III 4 113a32)
Another sub-question within moral metaphysics is whether moral facts are “natural” facts? If so, then ethical naturalism is true. If not, then ethical non-naturalism is true. But some have argued that this distinction is not all that important (Shafer-Landau 2003). Even if ethical naturalism is true, we have some work to do. It might be that moral facts are type-type identical to some natural facts (Jackson 1998); or that moral facts are one type of familiar of natural kind (Boyd 1988); or that they are grounded in human nature (Brown 2009). Since neo-Aristotelianism is offered as a species of moral naturalism, I shall elaborate on it in the next section. 
The main question in moral semantics is whether moral terms refer, whether moral judgments are “truth-apt” or truth evaluable. If there are no moral facts then non-cognitivists offer a compelling explanation of how we use moral language. Moral terms do not refer but express. They do not describe objects but express something important about subjects (our norms, our feelings, our recommendations). But of course, we cannot assume moral nihilism. If moral facts do exist, then the most likely explanation of our moral language is that it refers to those facts. (Alternately, cognitivist error-theorists accept that our moral judgments are truth-evaluable and that moral terms refer but deny that they successfully describe any moral facts.)
The main question in moral epistemology is whether moral knowledge (conceived as knowledge of moral facts) is possible, and if so, how. If we learn by the same kind of basic rational capacity by which we know that modus ponus is valid and that three times three makes nine, then we may call this moral rationalism (Shafer-Landau 2003). If we learn, rather, of moral facts by the same kind of basic empirical observation by which we know that grass is green or metals conductible, then we can call this moral empiricism (Boyd).  If we learn of moral facts by a special moral intuition, contrasted with familiar rational and empirical methods, we can call this moral intuitionism (Moore 1903; Audi 2009). And finally, if we simply do not have moral knowledge, if we are massively mistaken in our judgments within the moral domain, then error-theory is true. 
A further question within moral rationalism is whether reason identifies or constructs moral truths. Contrast the substantive view of rationality with the procedural view of rationality: “Among contemporary philosophers, Christine Korsgaard has developed the most ambitious, and controversial, version of Kantian constructivism. She defines Kantian constructivism as a form of “procedural realism”—the view that “there are answers to moral questions because there are correct procedures for arriving at them”; and she contrasts procedural realism with “substantive realism”—the view that “there are correct procedures for answering moral questions because there are moral truths or facts, which exist independently of those procedures, and which those procedures track” (Korsgaard 1996a, 36–37; see also Engstrom 2009, 119).” (Bagnoli 2011)
Finally, and crucially, the question within moral motivation and action is whether moral reasons are necessarily motivating. If so, then moral internalism about moral reasons is true; necessarily, when I identify a moral reason for φ-ing I am motivated to φ. If not, then moral externalism is true; I can have a moral reason to φ but not necessarily be motivated to φ. 
A further sub-question within moral motivation is whether moral reasons are a special kind of practical reason or not. According to reasons internalism, having a practical reason to φ necessarily means I am motivated to φ. So I might have a moral practical reason not to φ but an overriding practical reason to φ anyway. 
Within this admittedly quick taxonomy, virtue ethics has a not very clear place. Each virtue ethicist we shall consider has their own answers or their own emphases. 

Moral Naturalism
Neo-Aristotelians attempt to carve out a space in this landscape. Neo-Aristotelianism is taken as a brand of moral naturalism. What is moral naturalism? Moral naturalism is most broadly understood as any ethical theory that is compatible with the tradition of naturalistic philosophy (Lenman 2006). 
Although metaphysical naturalism (sometimes just “naturalism”) is a “reigning creed in analytic philosophy” (Gasser 2013) it is not altogether clear whether it is one thing or many, and if it is one, what it is. Characterizing it here simply or without controversy is a hopeless task, but we must say something until we return to this question. So, very roughly, for naturalistic thinkers, all facts are natural facts. And natural facts are usually defined (both by exponents and opponents of such naturalism) in reference to the kinds of facts studied by scientists (Shafer-Landau 2003; Papinau 2007). These theses are admittedly far too vague to serve as anything more than banners.Even to call such naturalism “metaphysical naturalism” might be wrong, since naturalism may be nothing more than a set of methodological commitments. But such naturalism has been called metaphysical naturalism as well as many other names: it has been called a “research program” (Shafer-Landau 2003); a weltenschauung or worldview (Goetz 2008); a quasi-religion (Plantinga); a set of procedural methodological and substantive ontological commitments, a set of methodological commitments alone (Jacobs; Rea 2013). It has been maligned as scientism but also celebrated as scientism (Rosenburg 2011). Very loosely, naturalistic philosophers value the scientific method or methods above all others, including a priori philosophizing. Also, some or most naturalistic philosophers are anti-theists. Theism is the tradition that rivals naturalism (Murphy 2013). 
	Not surprisingly, a wide variety of ethical theories — some of them incompatible with each other — are compatible with naturalism in this sense: Ethical nihilism, non-naturalist moral realism, error theory, and many others. To pick these out, let us call them naturalistic ethics.  I will return to the question of whether my ethical theory fits (or does not) as a naturalistic ethics in a later chapter on metaphilosophy. For now, let us zoom in a bit. 
	More narrowly, moral or ethical naturalism is a species of moral realism. (I shall not distinguish here between the terms ‘moral’ and ‘ethical’.) So for the moral naturalist, moral facts are part of the world in the sense that they exist, they are part of reality. And also, moral facts are part of the natural world, in the sense that moral facts are natural facts. Now, moral facts are either identical to natural facts (strong type-type identification) or merely supervene upon natural facts in a way to be defined. Call the first reductive naturalism and the second non-reductive. 
Non-naturalism
Moral naturalism is in this more narrow context contrasted with non-naturalism. Non-naturalism can come in a metaphysical flavor or an epistemological one. For instance, a non-naturalist like G. E. Moore (1903) might urge that rightness is a real property that is not physical, or identifiable with any natural property, or definable in natural terms. But a non-naturalist like Shafer-Landau does not so insist on distinguishing his view from non-reductive naturalists along metaphysical lines. 
He thinks the difference between his non-naturalism and someone else’s non-reductive naturalism doesn’t amount to much. Rather, he insists that at least some moral truths are knowable a priori. Let’s call Shafer-Landau’s contention that the distinction between non-reductive naturalism and non-naturalism — on metaphysical grounds — is of little or no importance the minimal metaphysical significance thesis (or MMS). If MMS is true, then the primary difference or significant difference between non-naturalism and naturalism (in ethics) is on the question of whether any moral judgments can be known to be true a priori. 
Kinds of Moral Naturalism
Leaving the debate between naturalism and non-naturalism aside, let’s look more closely at a variety of ethical naturalisms. One kind of ethical naturalism today is consequentialism. The consequentialist usually takes some state of affairs to be universally desired or desirable for its own sake: human happiness (Mill), beauty (Moore), human welfare (Boyd), happiness of all sentient beings (Singer), and so on. Not all consequentialists are naturalists — Moore for instance took beauty and goodness to be non-natural and irreducible properties whose instantiation was desirable for its own sake — but most are. Let’s take Mill for example. Mill is standardly taken to have proposed a naturalistic theory (which was, of course, a modified Epicurean theory). For utilitarians, ‘right’ simply means happiness-maximizing. Happiness is pleasure and/or freedom from pain. When we act, and especially when we make laws, we often behave such that more people are hurt than helped. There is no other justification for a law or behavior than that it maximizes happiness for the greatest number of us (in a society or as a species), and there is no other critique or complaint of a law or behavior than that it tends to minimize happiness or maximize pain for a greater number. These kind of theories are very promisingly naturalistic. Happiness is defined in terms of human psychological states (pleasure/freedom from pain). The property of happiness and the human bearers of the property can explained as natural. Whatever metaphysical account we give of property-instantiation had better make the property of ‘feeling pleasure’ natural. Humans are, presumably, are continuous with nature. It would not do for a naturalists to argue that say, being ectoplasmic was a ‘natural property’ of poltergeists but deny that poltergeists are part of nature. Moral motivation is also natural, since all humans already do wish to be happy, already pursue happiness. 
	Of ethical naturalisms, there are four major types of views on offer. The last I’ll consider (neo-Aristotelianism) is the one I favor and will defend in this dissertation. But it is worthwhile to mention the others here, along with some quick arguments on their behalf and against them. For lack of a better organizing principle, I’ll take them from more to less reductionistic. 
Functionalism
One respectably naturalistic kind of ethical naturalism is “funcionalism” of Frank Jackson. Jackson is a physicalist monist. As such, his theory closely identifies normative facts and natural (physical) facts. Normative facts are nothing over and above physical ones.  In fact, natural (physical) facts “entail” moral facts the way natural (physical) facts “entail” psychological ones. The constitution of your brain matter just so entails that you are a thinking thing, or feeling sensation F, or what have you. Similarly, the constitution of the physical and social world just so entails that R is right and W is wrong. Ethical properties supervene on descriptive properties: for any two possible worlds, if they have all the same physical properties then they have all the same ethical properties. 
I do not find this line of thought promising in part because I do not find physicalism persuasive. I cannot go into a full critique of Jackson here. Instead, two brief objections: Jackson’s reductive strategy amounts to showing that for every evaluative property there is (or could be) a descriptive property (given a large enough Ramsey-style series of disjunctions). But this would only work if demonstrating the universal correlation between X and Y demonstrated the identity of X and Y. That is a bullet Jackson is willing to bite. I, with David Enoch, am not: it seems to me false that necessarily co-extensive properties are identical. He mentions “common examples”  of “(purported) counterexamples …. like triangularity (having three angles) and trilaterality (having three sides), or the property of being the number 2 and the property of being an even prime”. These are properties that are not or do not most plausibly seem identical but are necessarily co-extensive.
A second worry: Jackson’s defense against open question objections is inadequate. He identifies the relevant evaluative property to be reduced by drawing it from “folk morality” and equating it with some descriptive property. The evaluative property is one we already roughly know, such as ‘rightness.’ The descriptive property he says “satisfies the role mature folk morality assigns to rightness”. The problem is the big (Ramsified) descriptive property by his own lights includes an evaluative component: it satisfies the role assigned by “mature” folk morality. Mature” can of course have a purely factual or descriptive meaning (“mature bourbon” is simply older than others) but it most often has a positive evaluative connotation (“a mature 12-year old” is more responsible than her peers). I dare say by the ambiguous predicate ‘mature’ Jackson has unwittingly introduced into his hoped-for purely descriptive property just another kind of evaluative property. If he means the mature folk morality simply comes later in time then the open questioner could ask: yes it’s older, but is it better? If he means it is better, then all he has done is define one evaluative property in terms of another evaluative property. 
Cornell Realism (Boyd, Railton)
A second kind of ethical naturalism is “Cornell Realism.” Contemporary consequentialists follow some parts of Mill (though of course update his theory in many ways). For so called “Cornell Realists” like Richard Boyd, what in part makes consequentialism so attractive is that it makes ethical inquiry continuous with scientific inquiry. The kinds of things that benefit human beings are natural things: food, shelter, clothing, peaceful society, companions for friendship and mates for romance, freedom of thought, etc.
For Boyd, evaluative predicates like ’good’ are similar to natural kinds like ‘metal’ which answer to specific families of natural properties. Furthermore, once we flesh out what kinds of things are good, what kinds of things contribute to our welfare, we can begin to identify what kinds of political policies bring those goods about. If I want to know what happiness is (the end of ethical decisions), I can learn more about it from cognitive and social sciences. If I want to know how to bring it above (the means to ethical ends), I can learn much from psychology, sociology, history, economics, and so on.
I do not find consequentialism very promising. Certainly, ethical inquiry can glean much from the cognitive and social sciences in understanding the details of human health and flourishing and, in some cases, learn about the means to welfare. But as a final theory consequentialism is inadequate.
Firstly, it tends to ground all normative facts in facts about humans, and I don’t think anyone has yet given a satisfyingly naturalistic reduction of human nature itself. (This is a point I return to in the third essay.) Secondly, arguments that ground what we should do in what we actually do often illicitly move from ‘is’ to ‘ought’. That is, they begin with factual premises and end with evaluative conclusions. “People seek happiness, therefore they ought to seek happiness for the greatest number.” This is only licit if we grant one ungrounded evaluative premise, like “we ought to do for others what we do for ourselves.” That premise seems to cite a normative fact that is both real and not obviously natural. Thirdly, I agree with Elizabeth Anscombe’s criticism that consequentialism is far too open-minded about some actions we already know are wrong. She says it is no use arguing with someone who “really thinks, in advance, that it is open to question whether such an action as procuring the judicial execution of the innocent should be quite excluded from consideration.” For a consequentialist, the very meaning of evaluative terms like ‘right’ is tied to an indeterminate notion: “whatever is most beneficial to the most people”. But we already know determinately, in advance, that it is unjust to judicially execute the innocent. Pretending the case is not closed is not just implausible; it is immoral. There are some moral judgments we would be wrong to be close-minded about — others we would be wrong to keep an open mind about. 

Quietism
Another type of ethical naturalism is called (by some) quietism. Thomas Nagel, for instance, is one who claims a kind of rationalistic naturalism that he denies has to entail metaphysical “baggage.” He says that moral facts are known directly by reason the same way other non-empirical facts are known. For example, we know that modus ponens is a valid mode of inference, the square of three is nine, and if John is a bachelor then necessarily he is unmarried. Similarly we know that if my car is going to hit my neighbor’s dog in the road, I should slam on the breaks. Such evaluative truths are, he avers, just as naturalistically respectable as mathematical, logical, or modal truths. Evaluative truths do not entail that there are a special sui generis category of facts (“moral facts”) over and above the natural facts of the dog in the road and the fact that I have time to slam on the breaks. 
John McDowell is another who claims that his ethical theory is naturalistic — though not reductive and “baldly” naturalistic. That is, he grounds normative facts in human sensitivity to the “space of reasons”, but declines to posit a special, supernatural reality to that space of reasons or to humanity. Human rationality and practical rationality are “partially re-enchanted” in that they are not reductively, mechanistically natural but neither are they fully enchanted, special, sui generis. Rather, we learn normative facts by “second nature”, by growing up in families where normative facts are spoken of and treated properly.  
While I can agree with the emphatic insistence on moral realism, I do not find this kind of “anti-metaphysics” promising. Briefly, it ignores the puzzle that ethical and other normative facts seem just fundamentally different from descriptive facts. Instead of naturalizing normative facts, it folds mysterious normative facts into a bundle (with mathematical and logical facts, say) and leaves the whole bundle mysterious.  It seems to me to help itself to the non-naturalist (platonist) belief that normative facts are real and truly different from natural facts without being willing to follow through with the logical consequences. </Text>

Overview:
Moore is refuting empiricist and metaphysical ethics and offering in its stead intuitionism, the view that goodness is a property known directly and basically. 

Mill equivocates on saying that the only proof that something is desirable is that people desire it, since ‘desirable’ could mean ‘capable of being desired’ or ‘worthy of being desired’ Moore, 1903, Section 40).

            <Title>### Why these five? </Title>
            <Text>### Why these five? 

A second question we should ask and answer up front: Why these five? Certainly, these five authors are an excellent starting point, since they have each in their own way contributed to the revival of virtue ethics. But there are certainly many important and influential philosophers who have written on virtue ethics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: any list of "big names" would have to include Peter Geach,[@geach1977virtues] Elizabeth Anscombe,[@anscombe1958; @anscombe1957intention] Iris Murdoch,[@murdoch2013sovereignty] Martha Nussbaum,[@nussbaum1995;  @nussbaum1988non] Judith Thomson, Julia Annas,[@annas2011intelligent] Michael Thompson, Christine Swanton,[@swanton2003virtue] Michael Slote,[@slote1992morality] Paul Bloomfield[@bloomfield2003moral], among others. And certainly, one could construct a worthwhile project approaching some or all of these authors. 

Admittedly, I select them first because I find them among the most interesting, the most sympathetic to my own established views, and the most influential in helping me discard old views and acquire new ones. Secondly, most of them already in extended conversation with each other. For example, there are clear lines of influence from Anscombe to all these writers; from MacIntyre to Hursthouse; from Foot to McDowell, and so on. Yet for all these converging lines, there are many divergent ones. These five represent a fascinating diversity of views. Highlighting overlapping points and contrasting divergent ones promises an opportunity for illuminating connections and deeper insights into the theory of each author. 

 Thirdly, each of these philosophers is similarly ambitious in presenting coherent yet wide-ranging theories sensitive both to normative ethical questions about virtue, happiness, goodness, human well-being, etc., and also to the foundations of virtue in moral epistemology, moral metaphysics, moral psychology, etc. MacIntyre, Hursthouse, Foot, and McDowell, and Adams each present the ethical *and* metaethical aspects of their theories as an organic whole. This ambitious kind of project Stephen Darwall simply calls "philosophical ethics”.[@darwall2003should]  

In recognition of their approach to philosophical ethics, some of these virtue theorists are classified as both virtue ethicists and "neo-Aristotelians." There are two important metaphilosophical confusions lurking behind these innocuous distinctions. 

To begin to see the confusions, consider the way James Lenman summarizes neo-Aristotelianism as a version of "moral naturalism":

&gt;One important school of thought ... [is] work is inspired by that of Aristotle. This view has its roots in the writings of G. E. M. Anscombe, P. T. Geach and the early Philippa Foot among others. Its contemporary representatives include the later Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum and Judith Jarvis Thomson. As this list makes clear, this is very much the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics. [@sepmoralnaturalism. Lenman acknowledges that Thomson might need to be subtracted from this list and that John McDowell might need to be added.]

Lenman does not quite know what to do with neo-Aristotelian naturalism. The first confusing fact is the close tie between neo-Aristotelian naturalism and virtue theory.  Lenman seems bemused when he says that neo-Aristotelianism "the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics."  For when Foot, Hursthouse, McDowell are classified as virtue ethicists (a normative theory) *and* neo-Aristotelians (a metaethical theory), we might object.  Aren't these two different projects? One legacy of G.E. Moore's *Principia Ethica* has been the tendency to sharply distinguish primary ethical questions (about what things are good) from metaethical questions (about what 'good' as an evaluative predicate *means*). 

The second is an uncertainty with respect to who actually deserves the title of "naturalists". Lenman is not sure who counts, pointing out in a footnote that Thomson probably shouldn't be on this list and that John McDowell probably should. He says "McDowell is certainly pervasively inspired by Aristotle and he describes himself as a naturalist. See especially his 1995. But I suspect many philosophers would find his use of the term  'naturalist' here somewhat Pickwickian."[@sepmoralnaturalism]  The confusion arises beacuse Lenman and others[@rehg2003conceptual] are not sure that neo-Aristotelian "naturalism" is really a form of *naturalism* at all. 

Both of these confusions reflect deep fault lines in contemporary philosophical ethics. In brief, the fault line separates two contrary ways of understanding what *nature* is. Put differently, the fault line separates two ways of understanding the fact/value dichotomy.[@putnam2002collapse] 

Aristotle and the broad Aristotelian tradition deny that the fact-value dichotomy is absolute. They conceive of *nature* as including everything that *is and ought to be.* Briefly, for Moore nature as including everything that *is* but not what ought to be -- all facts, no values. Moore and those influenced by him, both naturalists and non-naturalists, have agreed with the underlying assumption that "nature" is purely descriptive. But what if this assumption is mistaken? For Aristotle, nature is some facts, some values. So norms and prescriptions can be just as natural as facts and descriptions. If normativity (*what ought to be*) is natural too, then it might be possible that *human nature* grounds ethical facts. And this is just what virtue ethics says. 

The two questions above (about whether neo-Aristotelians are really "naturalists" and the close tie between neo-Aristotelianism and virtue ethics) have the same answer: Aristotle's ethics and his metaphysics (of biology and nature) cannot be easily extricated. The same goes for neo-Aristotelians. There is a tight fit -- perhaps an inextricable tie -- between Aristotelian virtue theory and the metaethical view labeled neo-Aristotelian naturalism. And neo-Aristotelian naturalists argue that nature is normative. Talking as if the fact-value dichotomy is not ultimate makes the other sort of naturalist squirm.

Now, non-Aristotelians might just double down and insist that metaethical theory is utterly procedural and not substantive, that it is neutral with respect to normative ethical theories. Two responses are possible: first, we might seriously doubt this alleged neutrality. For example, we might notice the conspicuous connection between supposedly "neutral" metaethics and first-order consequentialism: G.E. Moore, J.L. Mackie, Frank Jackson, Richard Boyd, Peter Railton, Simon Blackburn, and Alan Gibbard all endorse consequentialism. (We might even echo Lenman and call moral naturalism the "official theory of a main current in contemporary *consequentialism.*”) Secondly, even if a procedural, non-substantive approach to metaethics can be made neutral with respect to normative ethics, it is still admirably ambitious to construct a theory that pays attention to both. Darwall agrees. His (2003) essay summarizes the history of analytic ethics since Moore, and persuasively argues "that although metaethics and normative ethics are properly focused on different issues, they need to be brought into dynamic relation with one another in order to produce a systematic and defensible philosophical ethics. This mutual dependence is owing to the fact that issues of normativity are at the center of the concerns of both metaethics and normative ethics."[@darwall2003should] I might add that issues of normativity *and nature* are at the center of concerns about both. 

These are deep waters. Suffice it to say, for now, that in these five authors, a particular understanding of nature arises alongside a particular understanding of virtue, humanity, human excellence, and human happiness.  Foot and MacIntyre, for instance, begin their books criticizing Moore for his erroneous starting points. I think Darwall is right here: Moore's legacy is not the last word on the relation between the semantic and metaphysical foundations of moral terms and concepts and the substantive normative questions. </Text>

            <Title>Love and Virtue</Title>
            <Text>Can objective moral truth be known by any rational observer, regardless of the agent’s moral character, point of view, background beliefs? 
Robert Fitterer (2008) argues that some emotions, especially an agent’s love, is a precondition for seeing the objective ethical truth. Hursthouse (1999) is somewhat sanguine about denying that ethical truth can be achieved from an “external” third-person perspective — what particular ethical judgments shore up our continued reflection? Thomas Nagel (1989) thinks that objective and subjective standpoints are both valid even though they sometimes contradict. Alasdair MacIntyre is famous for asserting that all arguments, including his own, issue from within a “tradition” and can only be judged from within that tradition but also denying that his position leads to relativism. Talbot Brewer’s (2009) passionate plea for a retrieval of ethics is also a retrieval of the self — he shies away from Iris Murdoch’s more gutsy locution: recovering the soul. 

In this essay, venture into these treacherous waters. My inquiry shall follow the lead Anscombe, MacIntyre, Murdoch, and Brewer. My antagonist, not through ill-will but through a need for dialectical interlocutors, will be Hursthouse and Nagel. Nagel is too pessimistic that the “objective” viewpoint is the scientific one — assuming as he does (and many others) that empirical and quantitative science is all there is to science; instead, I propose, optimistically, that the subjective viewpoint is scientific, since theoretical and qualitative science are also science. And Hursthouse (and with her, John McDowell) are too optimistic about the Neurathian project of rebuilding our ethical outlook from within, without being impinged upon by objective (stance-independent) moral reality that is “out there.” The correct balance — no, not balance: the correct union of wild optomism and wild pessimism is in Robert Adams, for whom simply being for the good is enough to begin one’s journey to objective moral truth; but being for the good is only a beginning, with a thousand distractions and obstacles that get in the way to becoming truly virtuous. 
In the virtue ethical framework we have been developing, there is only one narrative: our life is unfolding dialectically along cognitive and practical lines, as we strive for wisdom and for virtue. Each step of “progress” is not progress for the human race or the culture but for the person progressing. 






Fitterer first demonstrates how certain cognitive operations set out in Aristotelian virtue ethics can indeed arrive at objective moral truth precisely through the contribution emotions make in moral discernment. Then, drawing on Lonergan's notion of inductive insight, he argues that objectivity is the result of the properly functioning subjectivity of a moral agent. Finally, building on his study of Nussbaum's ethical writings, Fitterer concludes that compassionate love is an attitude that actually fosters the likelihood of discerning and choosing the genuine good, and encourages objectivity in moral decision-making.</Text>

            <Title>Neo-Aristotelianism </Title>
            <Text>Neo-Aristotelianism
The final form of ethical naturalism to consider here is so-called neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics. This is the form I favor. It was inaugurated within anglophone circles by Elizabeth Anscombe, P. T. Geach, and others. It was picked up and promoted by Alasdair MacIntyre, Rosalind Hursthouse and others. These neo-Aristotelian thinkers take Aristotle’s ethical theorizing to be largely right. They happen also to find in Aristotle an alternative to nonnaturalism. Neo-Aristotelians straddle the line, some on one side, some on the other. For neo-Aristotelians, moral facts are grounded in human nature (MacIntyre 1981; Hursthouse 1999; Foot 2001; Brown 2008). 
Ethics seems to be the domain of rational creatures like us. We find ourselves morally motivated; we criticize others for failing to meet moral standards; we perceive or talk is if we perceive moral facts. So ultimately, ethical naturalism must give an account of this human experience. The early pragmatic naturalists were optimistic that even human experience can be understood without necessarily reducing humanity to mere matter and without ascribing to humanity a separate, spiritual nature discontinuous with the whole. In this way, neo-Aristotelianism is a form of ethical naturalism but it is also quite different from those discussed above. 
Human beings have a lifeform. This lifeform is discoverable either through familiar, “outside” scientific investigation or through a combination of such investigation with familiar “inside” ethical education and introspection.  

Objections to Neo-Aristotelianism Metaethics
But Lenman and others have worries about neo-Aristotelian metaethical foundations of virtue ethics. A first worry is about teleology. If the universe contains no final causes then we cannot appeal to final causes in our ethical theory. Or, if final causation is real but is only a feature of human agency — our intentionality, our goal-orientation, our practical reasoning — then still, we cannot appeal to final causes as external features of human nature, as are features like our being cordates or being primates. They are we might say features of our “inside”, our psychology, our cognitive capacities. 
A second worry is that even if we can evaluate a member of a species (cactus, deer, crocodile, human) by its success or failure at achieving the characteristic end of the species, such an evaluation is a “straightforward factual matter”; it is not evaluation but classification.
“Given such examples, a critic may urge, it's hard to see how we are here concerned here with evaluation except in a highly deflationary sense that has little bearing on ethics, as opposed simply to a kind of classification.” (Lenman 2006)
Hursthouse argues that our rationality makes us different from other animals. So evaluating individual humans by how well we carry on in the rational way is not only distinctly evaluative but it is continuous with the manner of evaluation of non-rational animals. 
A third worry, in response to Hursthouse’s response to the second worry, is that we are no longer “naturalistic.”
“Once this is said, it might be objected, we've more or less left the naturalism behind. We don't need anything remotely like ethology to tell us that we should favour ethical views supported by good reasons to those not so supported nor do we need to be any sort of naturalists to believe it.” 
It is not clear what Lenman means by saying we’ve left naturalism behind. Does he mean metaphysical naturalism or simply the belief that ethical facts supervene on or are identical to natural facts? 
A fourth worry is about using rationality as the differentia of human species. This objection Lenman credits to Williams.
“And we might legitimately follow Williams in asking if we're concerned with what is distinctively and characteristically human why make such a big deal about rationality. Why not the making of fire, having sexual intercourse without regard to season, despoiling the environment and upsetting the balance of nature or killing things for fun (Williams 1972, 73)?   
An obvious preliminary reply to this objection is that all the actions Williams mentions are ones we uniquely undertake in virtue of our rationality. Fires occur naturally (from lightning strikes, lava, meteorites) but only humans have mastered the ability to make fire at will (from flint or rubbing sticks together or chemical combustion or what have you). All mammals have sexual intercourse, but only humans can deliberate about when and where to do so. By virtue of our practical rationality, we can obey motives that have nothing to do with sex drive (the desire for acceptance) or ignore cues that naturally increase sex drive (female ovulation). Despoiling the environment, killing things “for fun” are, we might point out, abuses of our freedom. Only a creature with practical reason can elect (say) to preserve the environment; but by the same token only a creature with practical reason can elect to despoil it. 
Some further taxonomic reflections: Humanistic and Cosmological Metaethics
Viewed from a bit of a higher altitude, we can see that ethical naturalisms distinguish themselves by which natural facts ground moral facts. Though no one that I know of categorizes things this way, we might say that there are three options here: we can ground moral facts in (a) generic natural facts, facts about the cosmos as a whole; (b) facts about human nature as a whole (but not about non-human natural facts) — McShea (1979) calls some of these “human nature ethical theories”. ; or (c) facts about particular properties that humans have (rationality, belief-desire sets, laws, 
Call a metaethical theory humanistic if it defines value solely in reference to humans; call it cosmological if it defines value in reference to some broader metaphysical or natural (or theological?) entity and explains human value as a sub-set of value per se. Humanistic metaethical theories see value per se and human value as perfectly overlapping sets. Both (b) and (c) are humanistic. There is no such thing as “value for cacti” or “value for martians.” Most consequentialists are humanistic in that they think rightness just refers to acts or rules that benefit the most (human) people. Some would draw the circle a bit bigger and include any sentient life in what counts as people or what counts as worth caring about their happiness.  
But (a) is cosmological. For example, Boyd defines a moral fact R as grounded in a natural kind B, where B is a property or property cluster instantiated by familiar goods like food, shelter, friendship, freedom of speech,  and democratic process, since those natural things contribute to human welfare. But the natural kind B that realizes or supervenes on R is fundamentally no different from natural kinds like metal, and tiger. Hence goodness for us is a property of tending towards our benefit; but it is at least in principle possible to extend this account to other similar properties. Goodness for cacti is a (different!) homeostatic property cluster that tends toward their benefit. 
Jackson a moral fact R is identical to a (big, ugly disjunctive) fact B about people’s approvals, actions, tendencies, etc. The natural fact (B) is only a natural fact of humans. No humans, no moral facts (since no natural facts which are identical to moral facts). 
For Hursthouse, a moral fact R is grounded in idealized human nature or an idealized human agents. Moral facts are grounded in something generic to humanity as a species. It is not widely fashionable to use locutions like ‘human nature’ to describe the set of powers and capacities shared by all humans (at least potentially), but neo-Aristotelians often do speak of human nature in this way (Brown 2008). Moral facts are not grounded in the actions or beliefs of a particular human person or a particular human community, but in human nature itself.</Text>

            <Title>McDowell, Virtue and Reason</Title>
            <Text>McDowell, “Virtue and Reason”
Overview:
McDowell is attempting to prove that virtues are ethical qualities that only make sense ‘from within’, that they lend a certain kind of perceptive ability to their bearers. 

His main opponent is the notion that morality can be adduced from an objective third-person sort of view. This objection bases itself on the analogy to deductive reasoning, which follows strict rules and succeeds on the basis of allegedly objective rules “out there” for us to discover and follow. 

His rebuttal is to deny that deductive reasoning is so objective. Rather, deductive reasoning is not rule-following, except in that we follow a vague collection of rules associated by our common forms of life. We only know deduction, too, from within. So moral reasoning, he avers, we also know from within, by doing it, while doing it, because of our common forms of life. He does not much advance a view of virtue beyond the Aristotelian notion that virtues are qualities of reliable good-choosing, good-acting.

            <Text>Outline of Chapters
	I propose to answer these questions building on six key writers who are both virtue ethicists and sensitive to the metaethical challenges facing their virtue theory. 	Naturally, some due attention will be paid to other background authors like G.E. Moore, Peter Geach, Elizabeth Anscombe and other contemporary virtue ethicists like Marthan Nussbaum and Judith Thomson. 
MACINTYRE
	The second chapter is devoted to the first exemplar: Alasdair MacIntyre, especially After Virtue and Whose Justice? Which Rationality? though I shall pay attention to Three Rival Versions of Ethical Inquiry. While MacIntyre is vociferously critical of all modern philosophy, and even modern virtue ethics, he counts as a virtue ethicist for my purposes. 
	I shall summarize MacIntyre’s critique of modern ethical inquiry (conceived as a purely rational, secular attempt to define the universal good and universal right for all rational agents), his critique of expressivism, and his positive alternative (returning to a teleological, Aristotelian tradition). I shall build on his theory in two ways: the first is a presumptive case in favor of moral realism; the second a presumptive case in favor of natural teleology. Now, there are two ways to defend natural teleology. The first and more difficult is to index final causes (teloi) to nature in general; the second and more doable is to index final causes (teloi) to human nature. In the first way, final causes obtain in nature, in the cosmos as a whole. Teleological laws are a species of natural law along with microphysical laws, biological laws, mathematical laws, logical laws, and so on. In the second way, final causes do not obtain in the cosmos as a whole but only one part of it: evolved, rational creatures like ourselves. These final causes are observable in our practical reasoning, and in our rational practices. The phenomenology of practice (playing a game of chess, brewing a latte, earning a degree, maintaining a happy marriage) makes such natural human teloi necessary and indispensable facts. In my presumptive case for natural teleology, I confine myself to the second and easier of the two ways. I return to the first way later, in response to serious objections. 

FOOT
	The second chapter is about Philippa Foot, especially her later Natural Goodness. I shall summarize Foot’s critique of both G. E. Moore’s anti-naturalism and the subjectivism of Hume and others (especially Ayer, Stevenson, Hare, Mackie, Gibbard, and Blackburn).  Foot’s (2008) positive theory is that moral evaluation is ultimately grounded in these facts [— that is, facts about human life], or in what Elizabeth Anscombe refers to as ‘Aristotelian necessities’, i.e. the moral virtues; and thus the evaluation of the human will should be determined by facts about the nature of human beings and of the life of our species” (5).
	I will build on her theory in three ways: the first is to take her help in building a presumptive case for cognitivism in ethics: it seems that ethical and more broadly normative terms refer. Developing Foot’s ideas about natural normativity, Annas says this: “What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out…” (Annas 1996). By uniting evaluations of humans and other (non-human) living things into a single coherent account, Foot’s cognitivism solves many interesting problems in moral semantics. Moral language does not, after all, have a special linguistic function. If she does not solve them definitively, she goes a long way to putting the burden of proof back on those who wish to deny the appearances. 
	Those who deny the appearances appeal to the special feature of evaluative that it is motivating or action-causing. This problem of the “motivational gap” between normative facts and descriptive facts “might be the problem of ethics” (Brown 2008, 95). This is the second way I shall build on her theory. I shall endorse and defend her alternate explanation of the “action-guiding character of morality” — that is, the very old but not very fashionable thesis that “acting morally is part of practical rationality” (Foot 2008, 9). 


BROWN
Third, I examine Stephen Brown's reductive, Darwinian virtue ethics, especially his rejection of eudaemonia, his solution to the "is/ought" gap, and his argument that reproduction is the function of humanity. 
In this chapter I return in force to the objection from a naturalistic (non-teleological) picture of the cosmos, of McDowell’s “bald nature”. 

	2)	Teleology objection: Virtue ethics assumes or argues for teleology in nature, without which evaluations of living things including humans cannot get off the ground. An individual cactus or deer is evaluated by how well it instantiates the lifeform of its species. By contrast, Darwinism or neo-Darwinism is orthodox biology that is committed, it seems, to the view of disenchanted nature as a mono-causal order of efficient and material causation without final causation.  The orthodox “transformism” that has held majority sway since Darwin implies that lifeforms are essentially plastic or fluid, which entails that deviation from the norm may be a defect or simply a new adaptive mutation. Marinus Ferreira, “Reasons from Neo-Aristotelian Naturalism”   Stephen Brown articulates the objection that there may not even be a human lifeform, in which case the basis for ethical and other normative evaluations is gone. Stephen Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue”, Ethic@, Vol. 4., n. , P. 7-22, 2005.  


Normative human nature objection: Virtue ethics also assumes that human nature or the human lifeform is so to speak normatively loaded. The very term virtue (a cognate of the Latin word for man) implies that humanity is a normative concept; a human can become fully human or inhuman. That is, one can fail to achieve one’s own humanity or one can become truly human.  Some ethical naturalists also put themselves at risk of this objection, when they ground normative facts and “queer” values in humanity as if that were enough. For instance, Hursthouse says hers is an  enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being”Hursthouse 193. Consequentialists try to demystify “queer” values by grounding them in humanity somehow (our interests, desires, judgments, evaluations, natural ends, etc.). The assumption is that human nature is “natural”, so if values are “humanized” then values become natural. But the shoe could fit the other foot. A critic could object that values are nonnatural so if values are humanized then human nature is nonnatural. Quite possibly, humanizing these mysterious values doesn’t naturalize them, but rather mystifies humanity. By contrast, “A fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature”.Brown 2004, p. 4. McDowell sees the parity between reason and practical reason, and so naturalizes both in “second nature.” Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. The point is that if humanity is discontinuous with nature then we seem to have a bi-furcated naturalism that violates the continuity of nature.




MCDOWELL
Fourth, I examine John McDowell's philosophical anthropology of "second nature" in the context of his "liberal naturalism", especially his unique brand of idealism or inter-subjectivism as it pertains to practical reason. 
McDowell critiques “biological naturalism” or “empirical naturalism” which is reductive. He rejects transcendent supernaturalism. The third way is non-reductive naturalism he calls “excellence naturalism”. 

Moral reasons externalism, but reasons internalism, moral realism, ethical naturalism (in regards to moral philosophy), non-naturalism (in regards to metaphilosophy). I 

HURSTHOUSE
Fifth, I examine Rosalind Hursthouse's appropriation of (and differences from) Foot, and her account of moral objectivity and moral naturalism.  
For Hursthouse, the question whether morality has “objectivity” reduces to two distinct questions: (1) can morality be justified from outside, from a neutral, third-person, scientific point of view? And (2), can we solve the problem of moral disagreement — can we save the normativity of morality from the debunking and deflationary accounts that point to moral disagreement to disprove putative morality’s objectivity? 
On the first question, Hursthouse is surprisingly quick. No, morality cannot be justified from “outside”. But that is not such a big problem as some have made it out to be. 
It is the second question she devotes virtually the whole chapter to. 
So on this chapter I sort out the stakes of moral constructivism and stance-indepenent realism in regards to a strong foundation for virtue ethics. 
As for naturalism, Hursthouse’s thesis is that her virtue ethical naturalism is an alternative to supernaturalism and to reductive naturalism. This theme she borrows whole clothe from McDowell. 

	4)	Normative rationality objection: Virtue ethics seems to elevate the status of humanity above other animals and perhaps the rest of nature. More specifically, it tends to make reason and practical reason special. For instance, Julia Annas asks: “Does …[a strong] relation between our rationality and the rest of our human nature as social animals give us a plausible form of naturalism? We might think not, if we think that the Aristotelian form is a plausible one. For it stresses continuities between the evaluative patterns in our lives and those that are to be found in the lives of plants and animals. The fact that we are rational animals makes a big difference…” Annas, “What kind of naturalism?” She notes that the more we emphasize our rationality, the less important appears that which we share with the rest of nature (our animality and materiality). She seems to endorse the stronger form of rationality despite the tension. Stephen Brown on the other hand is willing to bite the bullet that some or all of the normative authority of our rationality might be lost if we concede that humans are really continuous with plants and animals. He somewhat regretfully admits (while defending neo-Aristotelian naturalism!) that his uncompromisingly naturalistic virtue ethic “amounts to a kind of evolutionary ethics and, in the end, is fundamentally descriptive” Brown, Moral Virtue and Nature 1. He notes that the more we emphasize our common ancestry, our basic biological animality and (ultimately) origin of all living things in non-living chemicals and elements, the less important appears our normative rationality.  


ADAMS
Moral anthropology. 
Sixth, I examine Robert Adams supernaturalistic, theistic virtue ethics, especially his avowal of divine command theory, his notion of "excellence", and how the unity and transcendence of the good informs his metaethical theory.

Some have worried that a traditional virtue ethic and a thoroughgoing naturalism are incompatible or at least uneasy bedfellows. Some ethical naturalists are content to relegate all value to humanity (all value thought and talk) and leave it at that. I do not think this kind of “naturalizing” is in the spirit of naturalism. Naturalism it seems is more ambitious than to be content with just “basing ethics in some way on… human nature.” Can virtue ethics be harmonized with the naturalistic approaches? The worry can be teased out into four related objections. Each highlights a real or apparent tension between unmodified virtue ethics and unmodified naturalism. 
	1)	Divinity objection: Virtue ethics has been traditionally the purview of theists, from the divine nous of Aristotle to the divine logos of the Stoics to the divine Trinity of Aquinas, and orthodox naturalism tends to be atheistic, agnostic, or post-theist (apathetic).  If we come to believe that humans participate in the divine nous, are indwelt by a divine spark, or made in the image of God, it seems that we have left naturalism far behind.

            <Title>Is goodness just human?</Title>
            <Text>####Is  the meaning of 'good' fixed a posteriori by 'what is good for human flourishing as individual, society, and species?'

1. It seems that it is so fixed, for what else could 'good' refer to but what is good for us? 
2. Also, 

On the other hand, we are supposed to care for the environment partly for our sake and partly for its own sake. 

I answer, every living thing has a good. And even some nonliving things plausibly have a good, or deserve treatment in some way. Artefacts and natural objects might demand something of us; we might be governed by norms with respect to them. 
Imagine this thought-experiment: Joe is sitting on his porch one day in Wilmore, Kentucky, sipping a glass of bourbon on the rocks. An interdimensional being suddenly appears at his side. The being appears both benevolent and intelligent. After some effort warming up its vocalizing organs (quite unlike our lung/tongue/larynx system), it utters, in English: "Hello Joe. I am from distant universe completely unlike yours. You will never reach it by technology or magic, but we can freely transport here interdimensionally. My people are dying of a grave and terrible illness. The only cure, our doctors and priests have discovered, is the blood of a human. A single drop of your blood, extracted in less than a second and without pain or side effects, would be converted to an anecdote and mean the difference between our extinction and our survival. The prophesies indicate that you are to be that human, but we could be wrong. In fact, due to a miscalculation of the severity of the illness, if we do not act immediately, our demise is near. Will you allow me to extract the tiniest drop of your blood?" 

Now, science fiction is useful for rendering interesting scenarios. The question is, is Joe obligated to give his blood? There is not, I think, any conceivable benefit to Joe. The procedure will not be pleasurable; it will not increase his health (and there is some reasonable fear that it might harm him, despite the being's assurances); it will not increase Joe's wealth; it will not appreciably affect his reputation -- in fact, if he tries to *tell* anyone about the interdimensional being, he stands to lose. The *only* benefit I can imagine Joe receiving is the peace of mind, in quiet hours and in old age, that he (may have) helped a distant race of intelligent beings. And it is hard to see how what makes this peace of mind pleasant except the thought that *I feel good because I did the right thing* . It is ridiculous to suppose he thinks  *It was the right thing because it feels good.*

The point is this: The norms that we ought to treat other rational agents as we (rational agents) want to be treated are just that universally-applicable and binding. Where seconds before Joe didn't know of the existence of these interdimensional beings and wouldn't have believed it if he heard of them in a story, now (through its speech and earnest plea for help) he recognizes them as, in a real sense, his brothers and fellow creatures, evolved from the same protoplasmic life in another universe or breathed into by the breath of the same God. At the same moment Joe knows that they exist, that they are rational agents, and that they need help,  at just that moment the norm springs into place and acts with full force, prohibiting, permitting, and requiring certain courses of action freely available to Joe.

            <Title>Human Practice Grounds Morality
</Title>
            <Text>The Grounding of Morality in the Nature of Human Practice

Kant grounded morality in the nature of practical reason. Moore grounded  morality (especially intrinsic values) in the sui generis nature of morality. Both hoped to “free the individual to determine for her- or himself what she or he must do in a given situation, irrespective of her or his own desires… to give knowledge of universal moral laws.” (Lutz %) 
MacIntyre rejects these attempts as self-deceptive “masks for conventional morality”. His alternative, similar to Michael Thompson’s, is to ground morality in the Aristotelian account of practical reasoning by examining the very nature of practice. The phenomenological experience of practical reasoning, its inherent teleological aspect, is an end-directed activity. 
Practices are not merely individual actions, like playing the violin or sculpting with oil-based clay; practices are also social actions, like playing chess or governing a city. Practices by their very nature or essence are teleological; that is, they are done for an end. 
Aquinas’ distinction here between the action of a human and a human action is helpful. Anything you or I do is the action of a human: breathing in sleep, scratching the scalp, even wincing and dodging if someone throws you your keys. But these are not, strictly speaking, human actions since they are not the result of deliberations, are not undertaken for reasons. 
Practical reason (the faculty of reasoning practically, the sensitivity to good reasons) is different from practical reasons (the propositions or objects taken into consideration by the faculty). Reasons are considerations that count in favor of doing φ or thinking that P. Theoretical reasons count in favor of (or against) thinking that P. Example: my dad who has generally good taste in such things told me African sunsets are beautiful. That is a prima facie reason to adopt the aesthetic belief that African sunsets really are beautiful. Practical reasons count in favor of (or against) doing F. Example: I promised I would read Gary’s book and give comments. That is a prima facie reason to read the book and give comments. The reasons in favor of that belief and action, thus far, are defeasible. 
For MacIntyre, some preliminary observation about human practices provides us with explananda for which to account. 

Reasons also explain action (Davidson 1963). A question such as, “Why did you move out of state?” is fully and satisfyingly answered by an answer position a (practical) reason, such as “The new job offers better pay and the city is closer to my family.”

            <Text>Conclusion
	From an examination of each writer, our goal is to create, sharpen, and defend a plausible virtue ethical account. But giving a normative theory is only half of a philosophical ethics. The second half will be considering objections from a metaethical quarter, and clarifying what, if any, are the unique problems and prospects for building a foundation of virtue. 
	My dissertation will be to offer a new plausible ethical and metaethical defense of virtue ethics. Building off the work of these important thinkers, my account will extend the tradition of Aristotelian and neo-Aristotelian metaethics toward a coherent, useful, philosophical ethics. 
My conclusion may be classified by the following familiar titles: virtue ethics, eudaemonism, since my definition of virtue is a human trait that partially constitutes happiness; and happiness is the natural end of the human species and of every member of the species, though the same happiness is variously expressed.

            <Title>Why Virtue talk? Theory/Practice Dissonance Problem </Title>
            <Text>The theory/practice dissonance problem. 
Before addressing the specific objections to virtue ethics, I would like to address a very general one. And that is simply the who cares question. Why would anyone care to include virtue talk in their ethical theory?
So my first task is to motivate virtue talk in general. There are very different ways of doing this.
A religious writer might point out that virtue talk is part of the sacred text (I Peter 1:7). A secular writer might point out that virtue talk by contrast offers an alternative to theistic or divine law moralities (Anscombe 1967). 
My starting point will be neither of these. I will start by proposing that virtue ethics solves a very widespread type of problem. I called this problem the theory/practice dissonance problem.
Roughly, this problem occurs when the ethical theory that one avows, perhaps in public and perhaps in writing, if one is a professional academic, varies from or even contradicts the ethical principles and maxims one actually takes for guidance and once daily affairs.
And so, for instance, this problem occurs when a self-declared utilitarian on paper declares in conversation that here she will not give everyone in the class an a for no reason because doing so would be "just wrong." I take it that utilitarianism if true means that very few actions if any are just wrong , considered as apart from any positive consequences that may result. 
Or suppose that ones ethical practice is guided in large part by the advice and counsel one recieved from ones parents. Jose thinks his parents were pretty much right about pretty much everything pertaining to how to live a successful and satisfying life, let's suppose. So Jose lives through some difficult and morally ambiguous situations by sticking faithfully to the plain instructions that he received growing up. These instructions form a set that is not part of a coherent metaphysical system nor is each member of the set necessarily coherent with each other, but he gets by. Meanwhile, in the course of studying philosophy, say, Juan develops alongside this practical, ad hoc, and messy practice a clear and coherent ethical theory that he never actually uses.
This is the dissonance I mean.
Many people, even philosophers but especially bioethicists, appeal to "common morality". That set of items universally considered right or wrong by all people in all cultures at all times. This kind of bottom up morality is much more useful than it is theoretically satisfying.
So let's say that the desideratum and virtue for an ethical practice is its usefulness, it's guidance, it's livability; the desideratum and virtue of an ethical theory is its clarity, consistency, and coherence with ones overall world picture. 
Virtue theory is the best of both worlds. It is a bottom up theory (of course justice is a virtue!) and a top down theory (now let's give a rigorous definition of justice as everyone doing their own business or everyone acting impartially )
That is one major motivation to begin with virtue talk or to incorporate it into ones current ethical thinking. 
Starting here also motivates us to avoid letting our abstract ethical theorizing five out of balance in either of two ways. We do not want our theory to become so theoretical it becomes impracticable or useless; nor do we want to preserve dozens of our common sense ethical notions untouched by our theory, so many brute facts unsynthesized and unreflectively taken in but not digested. </Text>

            <Title>Explanatory Priority Thesis</Title>
            <Text>Finlay represents the debate over moral realism as taking shape under dialectical pressure from two poles: capturing the moral appearances (especially objective purport) and respecting our understanding of mind and world (especially the “scientific worldview”). 

A response: If the pressure to do “justice” to “what obvious seems to be the case about the physical world studied by the physical sciences” is reduced, then the pressure from what very obviously seems to be the case about you and me and human nature gets a greater share of the weight. 

Explanatory Priority Thesis
This supports my explanatory priority thesis: 

Let A be an educated rational person with a general “respect for natural science” as well as a “respect” for philosophical reasoning and common sense. Let C be a very particular claim defended by particular natural scientists from a particular natural science, like the claim that “Birds descended from dinosaurs” or “Water’s chemical composition is H20”. And let V be some very general claim defended not only by particular ethicists but by many regular non-philosophical people, like “It is good to pursue good and avoid evil” (Thomas Aquinas, etc.). 


For any agent A, unless A believes more certainly a particular empirical claim C more than very particular claim V, A ought first to assume that the evaluative claim V is true when trying to understand the empirical claim C, rather than the other way around. 

In short: For any agent A, unless A more certainly believes C than V, A ought to assume V is true when developing explanations of how C is true. The opposite, I argue, would be a ridiculous method and a bad explanatory priority. Switching the relative priority of claims C and V results in a maxim like this: For some agent A, A more certainly believes V than C, yet A assumes C is true in when attempting to explain how V is true. 

Now my explanatory priority thesis is similar to an explanatory priority in the vicinity — and I do not wish to conflate to two: Let R be some approximately equally general epistemic claim, like “It is rational to follow the evidence.” I am not necessarily arguing that: For any agent A, unless A more certainly believes R than V, A ought to assume V is true when explaining R. This might be true. But the defenders of naturalistic reductionism do not usually make the general features of rationality itself the sole object of their adoration.  They equate certain very particular deliverances from particular natural sciences with rationality itself, and question the rationality of those who would deny, say, that humans have a common ancestor with all other primates, or that the earth is spherical, or that the moon landing actually occurred. 

What claim C is known more certainly than V? I have tried on a few (dozen) for myself and none of them do I believe more certainly than that it is bad to be cruel and good to be kind. So, for me, the explanatory priority thesis commends assuming it to be true that cruelty is bad (construing truth realistically) while I go about trying to explain how it is that neurophysiology and evolutionary biology and astrophysics are  so astonishingly interesting a research programs.

            <Title>my tradition</Title>
            <Text>
How I deal with objections
One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocutors, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproariously funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocutors are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergraduates are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to let the dead bury their own dead. 

While writing a platonic dialogue is a form of art I still find appealing and still use, that is not the best vehicle for this dissertation. So I am forced to give the views I think mistaken the best hearing I can give them in my own voice. 

The challenge of metaethical inquiry, I think, is to engage readers who do not already agree with you. A constant danger to which we are all liable is assuming too many crucial propositions and arguing at length about a bunch of relatively peripheral propositions. Metaethicists who steer clear of this danger are the likes of Alan Gibbard and Robert Adams. There is some value to articulating, clarifying, and defending a view that reader and author both (already) share. But that is not the valuable enterprise I aim for. 

The test, I think, shall be whether these pages find readers who disagree with the core thesis I present in Chapter 3, and, if so, whether they can recognize "their own" purported view in the pages that follow. If they can not only recognize but resoundingly affirm the view expressed in that chapter, then my objections may have some bite and may earn the high honor of receiving a rebuttal. 

It would not be a failure if no one found these pages; most such essays do not find readers, even if they deserve them. Failure would be for some ethical naturalist to pick up the book or a chapter on a shelf or online, glance at the view expressed, and to disown what I claim is his own. 


My own views
I speak from within a tradition. The term ‘tradition’ is one of those that is so broad as to be very useful for painting with broad strokes, but occasionally useless or harmful. By ‘tradition’ I mean that I am a born-again California Orthodox Christian. But I also occupy a broader tradition, that of virtuous pagans like Aristotle. I am an Aristoteliean, not in that I agree with every jot and tittle of his complete works, but in that I and many if not all westerners are descendants of the Greco-Roman culture that survives in Europe and America, and has in many respects spread to Asia, Africa, Russia, Australia and the world. 
Only in a final chapter do I revisit some of these questions from the unique vantage point offered by the Christian narrative, which is just the vantage point offered by seeing all of Christ’s creation (especially ourselves) in light of Christ. In this and in the subsequent chapters leading up to that final one, I restrict myself to the Aristotelian tradition. Firstly, I wish to seek common ground with my atheist, rationalist, or humanist readers who share with me not a common faith but a common civilization. Secondly, I wish to find out as much about nature and human nature by the light of reason, philosophical reflection on experience, and empirical study.

Traditions
I count this as An exercise in American Ethics. any philosophy that claims to be American must be in some way pragmatist. But method over doctrine doctrine means that the doctrines are fluid, flexible, in process, evolving. So those who resist my conclusions must either refute them or be branded enemies of progress. For a methodological naturalist who is consistent to deviate from the present orthodoxy is not a complaint but a necessary project demanded by present orthodoxy. Just as to be a single called organism is to cease being single called but become multicelled, to be human is to become transhuman. 

I count this as an exercise in Athenian thinking without the benefit of  Jerusalem. A Greco-roman-euro-American philosophy.

My audience are not those like me who not only trust and admire but also worship and obey Jesus. My audiences are those who admire but do not worship, trust but do not obey.  These might be agnostic, spiritual but not religious, or atheistic. But I do not presume atheism in this work. I presume that all evidences, physical, psychological and social are on the table. All experience and all science and all reason are for me sources, but no revelation other than the revelation of reason.

I hope in future work to explore those questions of especial interest to us who have more resources available to answering them, like Alvin Plantinga and Robert Adams.

A double danger
My goal is not to write from within my tradition as a theist and indeed a Christian. The resources available for thinking about virtue are much greater. Rather, if the church to which I belong is a citadel on the hill, and the broader western tradition is a city spread out like a wheel on the surrounding terrain, my goal is to leave the citadel and see how much work can be done in the city. Outside the city, of course, are the villages, towns, and countryside homes. And beyond that, wilderness. I shall not have much to say to the wild men who are utter moral strangers. 
The double danger of limiting myself to what can be said about virtue and nature from within a public and secular tradition is that both audiences are liable to misunderstand me: fellow theists or fellow Christians in particular may assume that I ignore the extra resources available to me out of disbelief or ignorance; fellow westerners who do belong or might belong to the tradition of Aristotle will assume that I consider the more narrow domain of secular discourse as a means of proselytizing for my faith, inching towards God. Both sides may think me either disingenuous or misguided. This is a danger that can be mitigated by explicit avowals of my true intentions. But such misunderstandings cannot be wholly guarded against. I think the reward is worth the risk. To detail neo-Aristotelianism and to give a novel account of naturalism that both theists and atheists or agnostics can consider, modify, and in part accept, is worth all the trouble.

Chapters 1 and 2 are concerned with the claim that virtue is sufficient to make us happy. This claim resolves into two key premises that (a) humans qua practical reasoners even *have* a telos which virtues enable us to achieve, and that (b) “the” human telos (with the definite article) is something like “happiness” — taking happiness to be a concept determinate enough to be a helpful starting point but not determinate enough to be final. @annas2011intelligent  argues persuasively that happiness is a more “empirical, intuitive” notion than is commonly supposed.

Chapters 3 and 4 are concerned with worries about metaphysical naturalism. This worry resolves into challenges to the claim that (c) human beings are natural, and that therefore (d) our telos and our virtues are natural. </Text>

MacIntyre's philosophy is highly interesting, but forms such an interconnected whole that it is difficult to pick out and criticize just one part. For those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are “historically extended arguments."</Text>

### My own views

One of the key technical terms we will learn from Alasdair MacIntyre is *tradition*. For MacIntyre, a tradition is a socially-embedded argument. Each of us is raised within a tradition. 
I speak from within the broad tradition of western civilization, which has argued since Plato over fundamental questions about goodness, reality, truth, beauty, and knowledge. I consider myself an Aristotelian, not in that I agree with every jot and tittle of his complete works, but in that I and many if not all westerners are descendants of the Greco-Roman culture that survives in Europe and America, and has in many respects spread to Asia, Africa, Russia, Australia and the world. 




But traditions are concentric; I am also an anglophone U. S. American from California. I count this as an exercise in American Ethics. Now, any philosophy that claims to be American must be in some way pragmatist. But method over doctrine doctrine means that the doctrines are fluid, flexible, in process, evolving. So those who resist my conclusions must either refute them or be branded enemies of progress. For a methodological naturalist who is consistent to deviate from the present orthodoxy is not a complaint but a necessary project demanded by present orthodoxy. Just as to be a single called organism is to cease being single called but become multi-celled, to be human is to become transhuman. 



I am a born-again Orthodox Christian. Only in the later chapters do I revisit some of these questions from the unique vantage point offered by the Christian narrative, which is just the vantage point offered by seeing all of Christ’s creation (especially ourselves) in light of Christ. In this and in the subsequent chapters leading up to that final one, I restrict myself to the Aristotelian tradition. Firstly, I wish to seek common ground with my atheist, rationalist, or humanist readers who share with me not a common faith but a common civilization. Secondly, I wish to find out as much about nature and human nature by the light of reason, philosophical reflection on experience, and empirical study.

I count this as an exercise in Greco-Roman-Euro-American philosophy.


### Audience

My audience are not merely those who (like me) trust, admire, worship and obey Jesus. My audiences are those who admire but do not worship, trust but do not obey.  These might be agnostic, spiritual but not religious, or atheistic. But I do not presume atheism in this work.

To detail neo-Aristotelianism and to give a novel account of naturalism that both theists and atheists or agnostics can consider, modify, and in part accept, is worth all the trouble. 

### The amoralist objection
My tradition accepts that it is good to be good and that we have a rational obligation to become virtuous. My tradition also generates an impressive list of virtues and a cohesive account of their relation and ultimate foundation. I do not pretend that this dissertation gives an account adequate to the task of *persuading* an amoralist, a moral skeptic, or moral nihilist. Then again, I’m not sure *any* account of morality could do that task. Plato’s *Republic*[@plato Republic, 621c] is devoted to (among many other things!) answering Glaucon’s hypothetical question: is virtue for its possessor better than vice? Why be virtuous? Is there *any* reason to be virtuous, excluding the admittedly external, contingent, or social benefits that accrue to the person who *appears* virtuous — such as honor, respect, position, friendship, etc. Yet even that book ends ambiguously with Socrates urging a *story* that “could save us, if we are persuaded by it”; as for Glaucon’s response… we hear only silence. Is he persuaded? Asleep? Still hesitant? Plato leaves us questioning. 

Foot *will* attempt to address the Nietzschean immoralist. Not being hungry for such an answer myself, I cannot judge whether it would satisfy someone genuinely undecided as to whether or not being being good is a good idea. 

My goal rather is to *clarify* and *elucidate* the tradition in which I find myself. This will mainly be of interest to fellow adherents of the tradition (broadly) of virtues. But it will be of interest to others in related or rival traditions. 

My position within my tradition renders impossible two goals — goals that are otherwise fine and admirable goals for someone to aim for. The first is the goal of persuading the amoralist. I leave that for others more worthy to the task.[@superson2009moral] The second is the goal of persuading the adherent of a rival tradition. Though MacIntyre occupies the center stage of only one chapter, the entire dissertation is undertaken in a *MacIntyrean* spirit. The best a member of a rival tradition can hope is for an “as if” account — a clear account that can serve the philosophical imagination of one who *already wants* to learn a “second-language” of another moral tradition.

            <Text>### Virtue ###

A discussion of MacIntyre’s conception of virtue must tell a story that grows more complex as it proceeds. He builds an account of virtue in three successive stages: personal, social, and traditional. Rather than attempt to encapsulate all three stages at once, it is wiser for us to retell his story in the same order. 

His first definition of virtue is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] This is the first stage or layer of his final account of virtue in *After Virtue*. A few preliminary comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are acquired. Meno asked Socrates whether virtues are "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is acquired. This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. 

Thirdly, virtues enable the achievement of *goods.* Virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally. A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both  instrumental to the achievement of certain goods and also partly constitutive of those goods. Virtues are means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. 

Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

This worry exposes deep fault lines that we must return to below. For now, we will set them aside. 

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference to the goods internal to *practices*. Practice remains a key term for MacIntyre's ethical thought. To misunderstand the term of art 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So we must also elaborate on this concept and the concept of “internal goods” which is attached to it in this first definition. 

In the following sub-sections, I’ll build up the remaining two stages of MacIntyre’s final account of virtue by elaborating on three key components: practice, self, and tradition.</Text>

            <Text>“A virtue such as honesty or generosity is not just a tendency to do what is honest or generous, nor is it to be helpfully specified as a “desirable” or “morally valuable” character trait. It is, indeed a character trait—that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say “goes all the way down”, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset.”

“The concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its possessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or admirable person who acts and feels well, rightly, as she should. These are commonly accepted truisms.”[@sepvirtue] </Text>

            <Text>
Reasons explain action. But the picture of an agent with a reason to φ who simply does φ is too simple. In any major decision, and many minor decisions, the agent is liable to be undecided, conflicted, confused, or otherwise “stuck”.   Conflicting reasons explain (many) conflicts within us between multiple motivation reasons or desirable objects. When I have some good reasons to, say, move out of state (a new job with higher pay, closer to family) and some good reasons to stay where I am (comfort with my job, better schools), I may need time and soul-searching to decide which set of reasons to act upon. Things kinds of conflicting sets of reasons let's call (non-tragic) practical dilemmas. The resolution of a practical dilemma is not usually an arbitrary spasmodic leap, a groundless fiat, an unconditioned election. Rather, the resolution of a practical dilemma is the discovery of a sufficiently greater number of reasons, or a few weightier reasons, in favor of one action or against the other. Even if I am merely "leaning toward" one path, this can be enough to settle things. 
Let's call the reason or set of reasons that tip the scale in favor of an action a conclusive reason (If there are many reasons, let's treat that set of reasons as a unified case in favor of the action.) Foot calls this the right thing to do 'a.t.c' -- all things considered. Quite obviously, some actions that recommend themselves and that are not morally wrong by any stretch of the imagination are sometimes not the thing to do, all things considered. Suppose I am craving a bagel for breakfast, and they are easily accessible from the bakery I pass on my way to work. I like the taste of bagels and this bakery is accessible are two perfectly unobjectionable reasons to go right ahead and eat the bagel for breakfast. But in context, contervailing reasons rule it out. Perhaps I am gluten-intolerant, so indulging my craving would fuzzy my thinking. The "all things considered" qualification just means that reasons for doing A are kept in view with reasons to avoid doing A, and that the conclusive reason or set of reasons is the one that, when I am being rational, eventually motivates me. 
A tragic dilemma is when I have (or appear to myself to have) a perfectly conclusive reason to do A and to not do A. </Text>

            <Text>### CHAPTER 2: ALASDAIR MACINTYRE

Chapter 2 will be a summary and discussion of the ethical thought of Alasdair MacIntyre, especially what is called his “*After Virtue* Project”.[@macintyre1984after, *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988), *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990), *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999)] The "*After Virtue* Project" invites readers to give up on modern rationalistic moralities and return to the (still living) Aristotelian tradition of virtues. 

MacIntyre is highly influential but difficult to categorize. He declines the title "virtue ethicist" but has strongly affected virtue ethics. I shall examine his definition of virtue as acquire traits that sustain traditions, enable success in "practices," and solidify communities. I shall summarize the idiosyncratic angle from which MacIntyre approaches ethics due to his extreme criticism of modernity and modern moral philosophy. How does telos, the narrative unity of the self, and tradition-constituted rationality support or imperil his conception of virtue? Can his "social teleology" model of virtue survive the objection that human beings have no inherent, natural telos? 

In critically appraising MacIntyre’s account, I will take seriously several of the objections that have arisen in MacIntyrean scholarship.[@horton1994after] For example, many have disputed his pessimistic diagnosis of modern moral philosophy; others have disputed the (alleged) relativism of his historicist solution; others have accused him of inappropriate nostalgia for the past; while others have challenged his notion of tradition. I shall attempt to respond to these objections and to find some lessons of value after the dust settles. 

### CHAPTER 3: PHILIPPA FOOT

Chapter 3 will be a summary and discussion of Philippa Foot's *Virtues and Vices*[@foot2002virtues] and *Natural Goodness*[@foot2001natural], which has been praised as “among the most beautiful and moving works of moral philosophy yet produced in the analytic tradition.”[@thompson2007reconciling] Foot, like MacIntyre, is critical of Moore's axiomatic assumptions and the ethical theorizing built upon them.

Foot argues, following Geach, that virtues are those "beneficial" qualities without which "human beings do not get on well."[@foot2002virtues] Virtues benefit both the possessor and the others in society with whom the virtuous person lives. Virtues and vices "belong to the will"[@foot2002virtues] and so exclude even morally relevant features of one's personality (irascibility) or cognitive abilities (good memory) over which we have no control.  At the same time, the presence of practical wisdom (an intellectual more than moral trait) on the list of virtues challenges the notion that virtue and vice are *merely* moral. 

She defends this theory from metaethical objections by offering a “fresh start” beginning with moral language. She concedes that non-cognitivism better explains the “motivational gap” between normative facts and descriptive facts, which Brown says “might be the problem of ethics”[@brown2008 95]. But she argues that there is an alternate explanation of the “action-guiding character of morality” — that is, the very old but not very fashionable thesis that “acting morally is part of practical rationality."[@foot2001natural 9, and also @foot1994rationality]

She also discovers (what she argues is) an identical match in logical structure between evaluations of plants, animals, etc., and evaluations of humans.[@foot2001natural] Her account owes much to Peter Geach’s *On the Virtues*, which is also unabashedly teleological. Ethical evaluations of individual humans are grounded in what Michael Thompson calls ‘Aristotelian Categoricals’ or ‘Aristotelian Necessities’. Such categoricals denote a species’ life form and hence ground evaluations  of how well an individual plant or human lives up to its life-form.[@thompson2008life, 1] For Foot, virtues are straightforwardly descriptive/normative qualities that exemplary human beings exhibit. Vices disable living creatures from exemplifying their life-form well; a deer that cannot leap or a wolf that does not hunt in packs is vicious. There is an essential parity between non-human and human virtues and vices. 

If space permits, this chapter will also engage with Foot’s exploration of happiness as “deep” satisfaction. She gives weight to the intuitive belief that a virtuous person can become miserable through life circumstances and ill luck. So she thinks virtues are not constitutive of happiness. Also, I shall examine her response (on the basis of natural goodness) to immoralism. In critically appraising Foot’s account, I shall engage literature from @annas1993morality, Michael Thompson, @mcdowell1998mindvalue, @marinus and others who have clarified and either attacked or defended her novel views.

### CHAPTER 4: JOHN MCDOWELL

Chapter 4 will explore and analyze the philosophical ethics of John McDowell.[@mcdowell1988values] It will explore his own brand of idealism with regard to reason and practical reason[@mcdowell1979virtue] and his understanding of the relation between virtue and happiness.[@mcdowell1980role] 

McDowell critiques "empirical naturalism", or the view that normative ethical conclusions can be derived from value-free observations from nature or biological.  (This is a response to one interpretation of Foot.) Along with his critique of transcendent or supernatural ethics, he carves out a *via media* some have called “excellence naturalism.” McDowell's account of virtue has moral and intellectual excellences as part of “second nature."[@mcdowell1996mind] Practical reason (sensitive to reasons, the ability act for a reason at all rather than merely because of desire or instinct) is "natural" for humans but not in the same sense that eating and drinking and sleeping are natural. Sensitivity to reasons, and the ability to act on those reasons, is natural via second nature. Second nature is not reducible to the realm of law that defines the rest of nature. Hence, ethical conclusions are ultimately not grounded in nature or in God’s will. They are grounded in a kind of Neurathian procedure of reflection on virtuous agents, reflection on our own lives, and self-constituted goals we undertake. 

Interestingly, this position has been classified by turns as "neo-Aristotelian naturalism"[@annas2005virtue] as well as "neo-Kantian non-naturalism."[@rehg2003conceptual] So I shall engage with some of the growing secondary literature on McDowell.[@mcdowell2008critics] 

### CHAPTER 5: ROSALIND HURSTHOUSE

Chapter 5 will explore and analyze Hursthouse’s powerful and influential *On Virtue Ethics*.[@hursthouse1998] Hursthouse approaches the difficulties of defending virtue ethics with panache and wit. Her account of virtue argues that virtues benefit their possessor. What does this mean? I shall discuss her account of  “phronesis, or practical wisdom, which is the ability to reason correctly about practical matters.”[@hursthouse2006practical, 12]

I shall pay special attention to her account of the telos of humanity (as four characteristic ends) and the nature of humanity. For Hursthouse, as for Foot, human beings qua life-form have a nature. Human nature grounds ethical evaluations.  The Latinate term ‘virtue’ is a normative term for man in that it implies that a human can be fully human or lack humanity; one can reach full humanity or become inhumane.  

On objectivity, Hursthouse largely follows McDowell but extends his account by defending her own notion of the “objectivity” of ethical evaluations. For Hursthouse, the question whether morality has “objectivity” reduces to two distinct questions: (1) can morality be justified from outside, from a neutral, third-person, scientific point of view? On the first question, Hursthouse is surprisingly quick. No, morality cannot be justified from “outside”. But, she affirms, an inability to justify morality from the outside is not such a big problem as some have made it out to be. And (2), can we solve the problem of moral disagreement — can we save the normativity of morality from the debunking and deflationary accounts that point to moral disagreement to disprove putative morality’s objectivity?  It is the second question she devotes virtually the whole chapter to.  Her discussion holds an important place in the debate between moral constructivism and stance-independent realism — which provides the strongest foundation for virtue ethics?  

### CHAPTER 6: ROBERT ADAMS

Chapter 6 will explore and analyze the philosophical ethics of Robert Adams.[@adams2006] Though he credits much influence to Anscombe and MacIntyre, my other key authors are more identifiably Aristotelian. Like the others, he aims to discuss the ethics of character rather than (merely) the ethics of action. He is also avowedly theistic in his metaethics, defending a virtue theory within a framework of a divine command theory.[@adams2002finite] 

I shall summarize his account of virtue "as excellence in being for the good,"" and his account of the good, his defense of the unity of virtues, and his responses to the charge that virtue is egoistic or non-altruistic. I shall also critically engage with literature responding to Adams, such as the responses of Richard Boyd,[@boyd2003finite] and the literature to which Adams is responding, such as Thomas Hurka.[@hurka2003virtue]

### CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSIONS

Chapter 7 will survey the terrain covered. What themes recur, and what arguments seem to stand up under scrutiny? If the labor of these chapters produces fruit, it will draw out points of value from the contributions of each of these influential authors. The concluding chapter, then, will take stock of those contributions and explore the possibility of developing a more exact and more plausible account of virtue. Which of these writers’ contributions can be combined? Which are incompatible? What future directions do these conclusions point to? I intend to close with reflections upon methodology in ethical inquiry. </Text>

Author abstract: In the face of widespread uncertainty about how best to characterize the project of neo- Aristotelian naturalism, this paper presents a novel way to understand the distinction John McDowell draws in 'Two Sorts of Naturalism' between a crass empirical naturalism and a more satisfactory alternative. Empirical naturalism is attacked using the representation problem as presented by Bernard Williams. The alternative, excellence naturalism, understands the reasons for action we draw from nature as the application of the characteristic functions of a being of our type towards its characteristic ends. They are excellences because they allow the overcoming of obstacles towards the good life for a being of that type. Finally, a problem for excellence naturalism is indicated, regarding how to handle new or changing forms of life.

he is pointing out that there are two ways for the project to develop, one where the natural facts are taken to be external to practical reasoning and work upon it, the other where these facts are taken to be an indispensible part of practical reasoning. He rejects the first, both in its own right and as a reading of Foot’s project, and urges the second as the way to go. [3] Instead of seeing McDowell as opposing Foot and her fellows, this paper will follow the line that it is the task of naturalism to give a satisfying account of how it is that natural states of affairs, including crucially what type of creature you are, inform and take their place in practical reasoning.

empirical naturalism, here taken to mean that an empirical study of us and our place in our environment can furnish us with objective facts about our ethical lives. This is done through use of Bernard Williams’s treatment of ‘the representation problem’, which is the observation that when we engage in practical reasoning we do not draw reasons from biological facts in their own right, but instead through some representation of those facts within a culture.

at what type of fact empirical naturalism might refer to as an indication of a good condition for a life-form. Because it builds its ethical view on a foundation of scientifically respectable investigation, we are going to have summations of observations, very much in the form of ‘human beings make more progress in their childhood if they grow up in stable circumstances’ – what Michael Thompson calls 'Aristotelian categoricals'.

2. Empirical Naturalism Because the object of ethical investigation is the lives of agents, there seems little reason not to find matters of ethical significance in the life-sciences. For instance, it seems a simple matter of fact that you get healthier organisms and less healthy ones, and it us up to biology to explain what it is for some organism to be better-off. It is easy enough to see how quite rich notions such as healthiness and fitness in one’s environment could be extended further until they give a plausible naturalistic theory of well-being.

For argument’s sake, let us say that some biological facts give us a reason to act one way rather than another. According to empirical naturalism, we have this reason in virtue of the type of beings that we are, that is, our human nature presses on us this course of action. There are two ways in which this could go, but together they form a dilemma in which empirical naturalism is caught. Firstly, to some degree or another, the directive might show itself as a disposition to act in the relevant way which is placed by nature in the agent.

once one generation has been raised by a home-bound mother, her daughters have that precedent to follow when they themselves start families, and, if they continue on the same track, their daughters have the precedent of two generations, and theirs three, and so on. At what point, if any, are the reasons for living that way still biological rather than institutional? That is the representation problem: the courses of action we have empirical naturalistic reasons to adopt cannot straightforwardly be separated from the directives of our culture.

If life-form relativism turns out to be true, then excellence naturalism cannot be informative: whereas it has avoided the charge of seeing all variation as being a deviation from the good, it now must avoid saying that no deviance can count as a defect. There is some bite to this problem.

If we do not accept this, we need to explain the fact that certain objects of our observation seem to act defectively in systematic ways but without harm coming to it. Without setting such a limit on diversification of forms of life, there will be no way for the excellence naturalist to draw reasons for action for particular states of affairs, because on this account recognising reasons depends on recognising forms of life.

“For all its failings, empirical naturalism doesn’t share this problem: there is a straightforward way to draw moral conclusions from available biological facts. Excellence naturalism has a far more satisfactory account of reasons, but does so at the cost of adding another layer of sophistication. It needs to move from available biological fact to distinctive forms of life, and from those to moral conclusions.”

Not all motivating reasons are justifying reasons.

### CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 

Chapter 1 sets the stage for the discussions that follow. 

It attempts preliminary metaphilosophical distinctions between ethics and the rest of philosophy, and argues against the default distinction between prudence and morality in favor of a holistic approach to ethics as practical reason. 

It also introduces the concept of “the Great Platitudes” and distinguishes these from the cutting edge controversies in applied ethics and metaethics. The importance of the distinction is made clear. 

Furthermore, this chapter addresses methodological assumptions, relation between first-order and second-order ethical theorizing. 

It surveys the landscape of contemporary virtue ethics, presenting some of the contemporary challenges and opportunities of virtue ethical inquiry in light of G. E. Moore, Peter Geach, and Elizabeth Anscombe and others. It identifies the source of the profound dissatisfaction that have motivated some philosophers to return to virtue talk.  

Finally, it elucidates the relations between our overarching themes (such as virtue, happiness, teleology, phronesis, practical reason, and human nature) that recur in multiple chapters. 
    
### CHAPTER 2: ALASDAIR MACINTYRE

Chapter 2 will be a summary and discussion of the ethical thought of Alasdair MacIntyre, especially what is called his “*After Virtue* Project”.[@macintyre1984after (1981), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988), *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990), *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999)] The "*After Virtue* Project" invites readers to give up on modern rationalistic moralities and return to the (still living) Aristotelian tradition of virtues. 

MacIntyre is highly influential but difficult to categorize. He declines the title "virtue ethicist" but has strongly affected virtue ethics. I shall examine his definition of virtue as acquired traits that sustain traditions, enable success in "practices," and solidify communities. I shall summarize the idiosyncratic angle from which MacIntyre approaches ethics due to his extreme criticism of modernity and modern moral philosophy. How do telos, the narrative unity of the self, and tradition-constituted rationality support or imperil his conception of virtue? Can his "social teleology" model of virtue survive the objection that human beings have no inherent, natural telos? 

In critically appraising MacIntyre’s account, I will take seriously several of the objections that have arisen in MacIntyrean scholarship.[@horton1994after] For example, many have disputed his pessimistic diagnosis of modern moral philosophy; others have disputed the (alleged) relativism of his historicist solution; others have accused him of inappropriate nostalgia for the past; while others have challenged his notion of tradition. I shall attempt to respond to these objections and to find some lessons of value after the dust settles.

Chapter 3 will be a summary and discussion of Philippa Foot's *Virtues and Vices*[@foot2002virtues] and *Natural Goodness*.[@foot2001natural] praised as “among the most beautiful and moving works of moral philosophy yet produced in the analytic tradition.”[@thompson2007reconciling] Foot, like MacIntyre, is critical of Moore's axiomatic assumptions and the ethical theorizing built upon them.

Foot argues, following Geach, that virtues are those "beneficial" qualities without which "human beings do not get on well."[@foot2002virtues] Virtues benefit both the possessor and the others in society with whom the virtuous person lives. Virtues and vices "belong to the will"[@foot2002virtues] and so exclude even morally relevant features of one's personality (irascibility) or cognitive abilities (good memory) over which one has no control.  At the same time, the presence of practical wisdom (an intellectual more than moral trait) on the list of virtues challenges the notion that virtue and vice are *merely* moral. 

She defends this theory from metaethical objections by offering a “fresh start” beginning with moral language. She concedes that non-cognitivism better solves the problem of the “motivational gap” between normative facts and descriptive facts, an issue which Brown says “might be *the* problem of ethics”[@brown2008 95, emphasis original]. But she argues that there is an alternate explanation of the “action-guiding character of morality” — that is, the very old but not very fashionable thesis that “acting morally is part of practical rationality."[@foot2001natural 9, and also @foot1994rationality]

She also discovers (what she argues is) an identical match in logical structure between evaluations of plants, animals, etc., and evaluations of humans.[@foot2001natural] Her account owes much to Peter Geach’s *On the Virtues*, which is also unabashedly teleological. Ethical evaluations of individual humans are grounded in what Michael Thompson calls ‘Aristotelian Categoricals’ or ‘Aristotelian Necessities’. Such categoricals denote a species’ life form and hence ground evaluations  of how well an individual plant or human lives up to its lifeform.[@thompson2008life, 1] For Foot, virtues are straightforwardly descriptive/normative qualities that exemplary human beings exhibit. Vices disable living creatures from exemplifying their lifeform well; a deer that cannot leap or a wolf that does not hunt in packs is vicious. There is an essential parity between non-human and human virtues and vices. 

If space permits, this chapter will also engage with Foot’s exploration of happiness as “deep” satisfaction. She gives weight to the intuitive belief that a virtuous person can become miserable through life circumstances and ill luck. So she thinks virtues are not constitutive of happiness. Also, I shall examine her response (on the basis of natural goodness) to immoralism. In critically appraising Foot’s account, I shall engage literature from Julia Annas[@annas1993morality], Michael Thompson, John McDowell[@mcdowell1998mindvalue, especially chapter 9, "Two Sorts of Naturalism".], Marinus Farreira and others who have clarified and either attacked or defended her novel views.

### CHAPTER 4: JOHN MCDOWELL

Chapter 4 will explore and analyze the philosophical ethics of John McDowell.[@mcdowell1988values] It will explore his own brand of idealism with regard to reason and practical reason[@mcdowell1979virtue] and his understanding of the relation between virtue and happiness.[@mcdowell1980role] 

McDowell critiques "empirical naturalism", or the view that normative ethical conclusions can be derived from value-free observations of nature or biological organisms.  (This is a response to one interpretation of Foot.) Along with his critique of transcendent or supernatural ethics, he carves out a *via media* some have called “excellence naturalism.” McDowell's account of virtue locates moral and intellectual excellences as part of “second nature."[@mcdowell1996mind] Practical reason (sensitivity to reasons, that is, the ability *to act for a reason at all* rather than merely to be moved by desire or instinct) is "natural" for humans but not in the same sense that eating and drinking and sleeping are natural. Sensitivity to reasons, and the ability to act on those reasons, is natural via second nature. Second nature is not reducible to the realm of law that defines the rest of nature. Hence, ethical conclusions are ultimately not grounded in "facts" -- facts of nature or God’s will or any such descriptive reality. Rather, they are grounded in a kind of Neurathian procedure of reflection on virtuous agents, reflection on our own lives, and self-constituted goals we undertake. 

Interestingly, this position has been classified by turns as "neo-Aristotelian naturalism"[@annas2005virtue] as well as "neo-Kantian non-naturalism."[@rehg2003conceptual] So I shall engage with some of the growing secondary literature on McDowell.[@mcdowell2008critics] 

### CHAPTER 5: ROBERT ADAMS

Chapter 5 will explore and analyze the philosophical ethics of Robert Adams.[@adams2006] Though he credits much influence to Anscombe and MacIntyre, my other key authors are more identifiably Aristotelian. Like the others, he aims to discuss the ethics of character rather than (merely) the ethics of action. He is also avowedly theistic in his metaethics, defending a virtue theory within a framework of a divine command theory.[@adams2002finite] 

I shall summarize his account of virtue "as excellence in being for the good,"" and his account of the good, his defense of the unity of virtues, and his responses to the charge that virtue is egoistic or non-altruistic. I shall also critically engage with literature responding to Adams, such as the responses of Richard Boyd,[@boyd2003finite] and the literature to which Adams is responding, such as the work of Thomas Hurka.[@hurka2003virtue]

### CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSIONS

Chapter 6 will survey the terrain covered. What themes recur, and what arguments seem to stand up under scrutiny? If the labor of these chapters produces fruit, it will draw out points of value from the contributions of each of these influential authors. The concluding chapter, then, will take stock of those contributions and explore the possibility of developing a more exact and more plausible account of virtue. Which of these writers’ contributions can be combined? Which are incompatible? What future directions do these conclusions point to? I intend to close with reflections upon methodology in ethical inquiry. </Text>

            <Text>###Demystifying values as "just part of human nature"
Some try to naturalize values by just putting them all  (or discovering them all) within humans. I don't think this strategy works. It doesn't demystify values, it re-locates the msytery. If all these mysterious non-factual value thingies floating around with no apparent connection or meaning in the natural world are all somehoe internal to human nature, and humans are natural, then all those values are natural, right? Yes, or human nature has just become non-natural. We used to have a "fact/value" split but now we have a "fact/human" split. 

To see how human rising values doesn't demystify values that actually makes humans mysterious, consider the cycle of euphemism. A phenomenon like human fecal matter is impolite to talk about. So we invent a euphemism like "feces." The euphemism works for referring to the same stuff without impoliteness for awhile. Then some kids get ahold of the term, realize what it means, and (having no taste) find it uproariously funny. They make enough jokes to *impolitisize* the polite term, shucking its dignified veneer. We invent another euphemism like "scat". To my knowledge, no one has yet turned "scat" into an exclamation expressing surprise or disapproval.  

To his credit, McDowell sees the parity of epistemic and moral norms. He wants to subjectivize moral norms, so he accordingly subjectivizes epistemic norms. Virtue and reason are *both* transcendental idealized processes, intersubjective human processes, objective enough for our purposes and to explain the objective purport in our thinking, feeling, and acting, but subjective enough to respect the distinction between human nature ("second nature") and *nature* nature (primary nature). 

Even so, second nature remains radically discontinuous from primary nature. Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. 


For instance, we could say that only nature is real and only what is natural can be known but argue that values and moral facts and so on are natural. But what do we mean by natural? 

* Could mean that values are endemic to human nature, to humans, and that humans are natural. Examples: John McDowell, Philippa Foot.  
* We could mean that values are features of the natural world just like natural kinds. Example: Richard Boyd. 
* Values could be natural the way that health is natural and anything that produces health. Example: Paul Bloomfield.
* Still others might argue that values are natural that supervene on normal natural facts the same way psychological fax super being on normal physical facts. Example: Frank Jackson.

But the fundamental tension between "inside" and "outside" might itself be a misunderstanding. That seems to be one of John McDowell's main points. 

What if the objection from discontinuity or dissonance is misguided? It seems that "science" supports reductive materialist metaphysics but what if our "respect for natural science" demands nothing of the sort? Then the objection against realism weakens. And its inherent plausibility and truly amazing explanatory power shines forth again unabated.

            <Title>Virtue Theory in general virtues and vices </Title>
            <Text>## Virtue Theory in general virtues and vices
To quote Philippa Foot, “virtues are, in some general way, beneficial.” Virtues, like frankness or courage are habitual activities that benefit the possessor and the community of which the possessor is a member. 

Foot thinks it a weakness that Greek sense of arete and the Latin sense of virtues include non-moral excellence. Robert Adams thinks this a strength, since moral excellence (he argues) is a species of excellence per se.Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, Chapter 3 “Well-Being and Excellence

Practical wisdom was counted as a moral virtue by the ancients, while we see it as an intellectual virtue. Which is it? Wisdom is connected, according to Foot, with action or the will, namely “knowledge of how to act well” in general matters such as friendship, marriage, parenting, and career, and knowledge of how to pick good ends. “Cleverness” may be knowledge of how to coordinate efficient means to any end, but wisdom “presupposes good ends” (5). A second part of wisdom, Foot thinks, has to do with the “curiously elusive” that that “some pursuits are more worthwhile than others” (6). Borderline cases are always liable to dispute. But someone who consistently values (say) worldly position over health and family relationships I judge to be foolish in that regard, and I assume most of my readers agree. 

Foot also argues for her version of Aristotle’s dictum that “virtues are about what is difficult for men” (8). That is, for any given virtue (such as justice) there are temptations — often strong temptations — to do what is vicious (such as overweening desires for wealth or overweening fear of criticism). 

Foot considers one puzzle about virtue theory that gave Kant much trouble. If virtues are “correctives” to tempting errors endemic to human nature (like the temptation to overindulge in the sensual), then is someone who struggles and works hard to do well more or less virtuous? Suppose a man does not steal when his circumstances practically beg him to steal: he can easily get away with it, no one will know, the thing he could steal will greatly benefit him and its loss will not greatly harm its owner, etc. He seems more virtuous because he overcame more in his pursuit of virtue; he seems less virtuous because he had to employ extrinsic motivation to get himself to do good. Kant concluded that actions done for other motives besides dutiful motives don’t have moral worth (Cf. Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, I). Foot charitably offers only one corrective to this conclusion: “Some actions are in accordance with virtue without requiring virtue for their performance, whereas others are both in accordance with virtue and such as to show possession of a virtue” (13). An action done in accordance with virtue (like self-preservation) but that does not ‘display a virtue’ has little to no moral worth, because it arises out of natural self-love. But that same action, under different circumstances, may display virtue — as when someone is strongly tempted to suicide but resists, preserves themselves, through courage and hope. Similarly, doing an action that one finds enjoyable (even if that action is philanthropic action) is in accord with virtue but becomes a truly virtuous action when it is done in the face of resistance. 

&gt;Can virtues be used to bad ends? For example, can the villainous criminal persist in robbing a bank through his great courage? Since it is “good for a blind horse to be slow” it would be worse in a sense for an avaricious man to be courageous. There seems to be some analytic contradiction in saying ‘courage makes him bad’. That trait that benefits him harms him. Should we give up the intuitive definition of virtues as bestowing benefits? What are the alternatives? Either courage is not a virtue or the bank robber’s action is not courageous. Foot considers that the power a virtue typically has may not “operate characteristically” under certain circumstances. [@foot2003n 16-17]

&gt; In this example we were considering an action in which courage was not operating as a virtue, without suggesting that in that agent it generally failed to do so. But the latter is also a possibility. If someone is both wicked and foolhardy this may be the case with courage, and it is even easier to find examples of a general connexion with evil rather than good in the case of some other virtues. Suppose, for instance, that we think of someone who is over‐industrious, or too ready to refuse pleasure, and this is characteristic of him rather than something we find on one particular occasion. In this case the virtue of industry, or the virtue of temperance, has a systematic connexion with defective action rather than good action; and it might be said in either case that the virtue did not operate as a virtue in this man. Just as we might say in a certain setting ‘P is not a poison here’ though P is a poison and P is here, so we might say that industriousness, or temperance, is not a virtue in some. Similarly in a man habitually given to wishful thinking, who clings to false hopes, hope does not operate as a virtue and we may say that it is not a virtue in him.</Text>

            <Title>Social to Natural Teleology </Title>
            <Text>The topic of teleology has been and continues to be one of great controversy and high feeling. Simply disagreement is less common than vehement denial and denunciation. Clearly, something important is at stake here. 
MacIntyre has lead me to articulate and defend a notion of social teleology. The Social Teleology Thesis is the proposition that human practices (individual and social) are necessarily, irreducibly, and indispensably end-directed.  This thesis both gives support to and derives support from a picture of human nature as necessarily social or political practical reasoners. I tried to offer analyses of this picture. I defended the end-directed structure of practical reasoning, and the view that what we are (at minimum) is creatures with the first-order potential to become “dependent rational animals” who can more or less independently reason. 
So far, the Social Teleology Thesis is compatible with moral realism of two very different sorts: the first is the kind of “stance-independent” moral realism that views fundamental moral facts — like fundamental physical facts and fundamental mathematical facts — as parts of reality that do not depend on human beings or human knowledge. The second is the kind of “stance-dependent” constructivism that views fundamental moral facts as a function of some actual or ideal human agent or agents:  practical reasoning itself, the agreement of societies.

            <Text># Alasdair MacIntyre: The Telos of Practice #


## Introduction

Alasdair MacIntyre is a highly influential moral and political philosopher. 

His eighteen books and more than three hundred published articles had an indelible impact on reviving analytic ethics by putting it into historical perspective. 

Two of his oft-recurring points are that ethical thinking is a species of practical reasoning and so our theory of the good depends inescapably on our theory of rationality; and that socially-embedded traditions both constitute and are constituted by their conception of rationality. Ethics is a species of practical rationality; rationality is a function of tradition. These two claims are, of course, tersely put. Our job is to unpack them below, and consider objections. 

MacIntyre is an analytic philosopher, and may be classified as virtue ethicist and communitarian, but he denies both labels. Instead, he has written as a philosopher and aligns with Thomism.  He has written about analytic philosophy, virtue ethics, the history of philosophy, continental philosophy, Marxism, Christianity, university education, political science, philosophy of science, and epistemology. He has refused to restrict himself neatly to one style, school of thought, or subject. His work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations. For example, he argues that emotivism is not only a metaethical theory of moral language but a “culture” with its own paradigmatic institutional expressions, like bureaucracy and therapy. 

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre he re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.] 


### Main question

This chapter focuses on MacIntyre’s “*After Virtue* Project”. The governing questions are these: What is MacIntyre's account of virtue? And in what project does that account sit? What are the primary objections to his ethical project or its account of virtue? And how plausible is his account of virtue, after these objections have been taken seriously?

As I shall treat MacIntyre, his central ethical insights are twofold: First, that Enlightenment, modern morality got off track by attempting to banish telos from morality. Intelligible, rational, socially-applicable Aristotelian morality includes human nature as it is, human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-achieved-its-telos, and practical morality which facilitates the transformation from the former to the latter. This surgical removal is unjustified and disastrous. 

Secondly, the restoration of telos into morality restores moral intelligibility, not to mention social order. The fundamental objection his critics have had is to query: How can telos be restored? How can virtues which are only intelligible in light of teleology be restored if telos can’t be? Either through metaphysical biology or the metaphysics of *practice*. Call the first natural teleology and the second “social teleology.” Telos must be natural, real, and non-imaginary. Telos is even “scientific” (contra Jean Hampton) if we include the social, biological, and computational sciences as ‘sciences’. Social teleology which is rooted in the metaphysics of action satisfies these criteria. Biological or natural teleology (to say nothing of cosmic teleology) satisfies these criteria too, but we shall examine that prospect in the upcoming chapter. MacIntyre takes the latter course.

	In order to make clear MacIntyre’s central claim — that social teleology underwrites virtue and makes morality intelligible, useful, and rational — we must explore his broader project and examine some of his central topics, such as *practice, life, and tradition-bound rationality.*

### Outline of chapter

I shall attempt to provide adequate answers to these questions by dividing the chapter into the following sections. 

**Section 1 Virtue** — What is MacIntyre’s project? Section 1 therefore tells some of the backstory that makes MacIntyre’s account of virtue intelligible. It explores MacIntyre’s accounts of epistemological crisis, tradition, and moral inquiry. The primary error of modern morality was its rejection of, or rather misunderstanding of, teleology. Modern moralities (especially Kant and Mill) attempt to retain the semblance of teleology without the substance. But it has not, and will never, work. Although such moralists claim to deny teleology they invoke it in their theories and inconsistently use everyday common sense moral concepts that *are* functional and teleological. MacIntyre’s preliminary definition of virtue as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices”[@macintyre1984after 191] and explores the expanded definition that invokes tradition. Tradition-constituted rationality undergirds the philosophical search for an adequate and useful ethics. 

**Section 2 Objections** — What are the objections to MacIntyre’s ethical project or his account of virtue? I voice a select few of the many objections that readers and scholars have posed.  Some “objections” are really demands for clarification on MacIntyre’s claims, though others certainly dispute those claims. Section 3 therefore asks whether MacIntyre’s virtue ethics is relative to tradition, whether his concept of tradition is coherent, and whether his account of virtue assumes a discredited teleological metaphysics of Aristotle. 

Is there really a theory of practice that can underwrite “second nature” — a social teleology, or does teleology need to be a part of “primary nature”. 

**Section 3 Replies** — How plausible is MacIntyre’s account of virtue?  In the final section, I shall carefully endorse part and reject part of MacIntyre's account. 

For instance, I reject part of his notion that virtues are relative to changing traditions rather than a stable human nature. And I endorse the thesis that human practice is teleological and hence that non-teleological ethics are either false or (in the end) *actually* covertly teleological, but defer the question of the relationship between *social* teleology and *physical*,  biological, natural, or metaphysical teleology.

### Introduction

Alasdair MacIntyre (1929-) is a highly influential moral and political philosopher. His eighteen books and more than three hundred published articles had an indelible impact on analytic ethics by putting ethics into historical perspective and powerfully challenging cherished contemporary assumptions.

Two of his oft-recurring points are that (1) ethical thinking is a species of practical reasoning and so our theory of the good depends inescapably on our theory of rationality; and that (2) socially-embedded traditions both constitute and are constituted by their conception of rationality. In other words, ethical reasoning is a species of practical reasoning; and one’s definition of ‘reasoning’ is a function of one’s tradition, one’s conceptual, social, and historic community. These two claims are, of course, tersely put. Our job is to unpack them below, and consider objections. 

MacIntyre is an analytic philosopher. He may be classified as virtue ethicist and communitarian, but he denies both labels. Instead, he has written as a *philosopher*. He most lately describes himself as a Thomist, though he was a Marxist, then an Aristotelian before that. 

He has written about analytic philosophy, virtue ethics, the history of philosophy, continental philosophy, Marxism, Christianity, university education, political science, philosophy of science, and epistemology. He has refused to restrict himself neatly to one style, school of thought, or subject. His work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations. For example, he argues that emotivism is not only a metaethical theory of moral language but a “culture” with its own paradigmatic institutional expressions, like bureaucracy and therapy, and its own paradigmatic “characters”, the Manager and the Therapist. 

In spite of (or perhaps because of) this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.]

I have said that MacIntyre’s ethical work is an invitation to restore the tradition of virtues. This assumes that our modern tradition is fatally flawed. Only if the tradition we currently inhabit is sick unto death would we be motivated to seek an alternative. And he does diagnose modernity as sick unto death. 

One might question whether “we” (Anglo-American westerners) inhabit a “tradition” at all. But MacIntyre points out that we do. It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives” in the popular sense.) For simplicity, I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ in most instances to describe this tradition. 

Modernity is a political movement. That is, modernity is a global human phenomenon, for it began with scientific, religious, and political shifts in Europe and caused cultural and intellectual shifts and furthered seismic shifts in science, religion, and politics. Even so, politics is perhaps the clearest marker of modernity; rise of the modern state is perhaps the greatest sign of modernity’s conquest of the western mind, heart, and imagination. As evidence of this suggestion, we can remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Hence, MacIntyre’s critique of modernity has political as well as social and ethical aspects. 

MacIntyre’s oeuvre consists of eighteen books and more than three hundred published articles. Throughout, his abiding conviction is that something is terribly wrong with modernity and it needs restorative resources from outside itself. . From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] In his early work, he took for granted some of those foundations. The rumblings of discontentment appear early and grow until the quaking has destroyed those foundations. But rather than embracing nihilism of the thorough, cynical, postmodern sort, however, MacIntyre surprisingly discovered an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue (and eventually Thomas) that MacIntyre continues to build. 

I would like to briefly present an outline of this critique. It will make more intelligible the virtue theory to come. 

MacIntyre compared modern moral discourse to catastrophe, where only fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive in states of increasing decay. He says: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

But the catastrophe did not affect only academic disciplines. It affects human culture. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the appearance of having a dialectical case for their value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any normative point you can think of (the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation), but they also disagree on normative frameworks (deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism), and on metaethical points (moral realism, moral epistemology, moral semantics), and more. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreeing on the formal and material propositions under dispute. The apparent impossibility of settling moral disagreements over weighty primary normative issues, like abortion, sexual ethics, torture, war, the proper uses of technology has become the defining datum of modern reflection on morality and ethics. 

Rather than despair, MacIntyre noticed that similar disagreement has marked discussions in the natural sciences. This observation proved extremely fruitful. 

Briefly, Thomas Kuhn’s watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* challenges the widespread naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquires has been growing, steadily, in a straight line, since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. The paradigm is a research program around which many can unite as well as a stable scientific system of doctrine that can be added to or pruned. But lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm, once revolutionary, becomes the stable scientific system of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyarabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call it MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] But Kuhn and Feyerabend ended in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology, a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. MacIntyre ended in a thoroughgoing, optimistic, progressive, anti-relativistic Thomism. 

This parallel explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. It is extremely cognizant of history; it is obsessed with methodology and epistemology. So is philosophy of science. 

The fact is that people disagree about morals. Many metaethicists react such widespread, rampant, shrill, and apparently intractable moral disagreement by giving up on moral realism. The old project was a searching for the objective moral facts, the self-evident moral truths, or fundamental moral principles by which moral disagreements can be peaceably and reasonably settled without browbeating, censorship, name-calling, and ejection from the conversation. The new project is to accept the painful truth that there are no such facts, no such truths, no such principles: agreement is either impossible or is going to come about by different means: social contract, say, or disparate communities accepting disparate sets of “common values”, each set incommensurable with the others but also invincible to criticism.

Other metaethicists react to widespread moral disagreement by redoubling their efforts to restore moral agreement by reference to moral facts, truths, or principles. Kantian (Korsgaard), utilitarian, contractarian, and now virtue ethical theorists compete in the marketplace of metaethics for the proper way to secure morality. 

It may not be obvious to those of us reading deeply in the discipline, but a moment’s reflection on modern metaethics reveals an iteration of the problem of moral disagreement. The disagreement among metaethicists (since Moore) about the proper explanation of and solution to disagreement among ethicists (since Hobbes, Hume, and Kant) has become the new problem of disagreement. 

This comparison between ethical crises and scientific crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. </Text>

Characterizing MacIntyre's life work as an invitation to recover the virtues assumes a problem -- a lack, a disaster, a crisis -- to which the tradition of virtue might be a panacea. So I'd like to say a few words about his broader project. MacIntyre’s ethical oeuvre spans many decades, eighteen books, and (to date) more than three hundred published articles. He has also evolved through many ideologies: Marxism, Aristotelianism, Christianity, Thomism. But persistent through each phase is a radical discontentment with and criticism of post-Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] 

To trace this discontentment, we might frame MacIntyre’s later ethical oeuvre as a response to the problem of moral disagreement. His earlier writings focused on ethics. These writings took for granted some of the major modern assumptions about what moral inquiry is and what it can and should do.  But very early on, he noticed that the state of the art was disarray. The first and most obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement.

The dual aspect of modern moral philosophy is that disputants on either side pretend to have objective moral truth yet possess no unavailable rational standard for supporting their own view. Without rational standards to support one’s own view, disputants are without rational standards by which to *rationally* persuade others. Individually, these aspects are not puzzling: One pattern is that when I meet people who do not share my tastes or preferences, I do not browbeat; I simply I live and let live. Another pattern is that when I meet people whom I view as ignorant or mistaken,  I try to persuade them by appealing to evidence to ascribe to the same rational, putatively objective standards I endorse. But moral discourse doesn’t fit either of these non-puzzling patterns. how can my own, arbitrary, unaccountable opinions and preferences form the basis for browbeating those who do not share the same opinions and preferences as if they were not just different from me but ignorant and mistaken? Moral discourse with its expression of moral disagreement still retain the appearance of rationality at the same time that the seem to have given up on the rationality and publicly-accessible nature of morality. 

Professional ethicists disagreed with each other on any normative point you can think of (the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation), on normative frameworks (deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism), and on metaethical points (moral realism, moral epistemology, moral semantics), and more. He was frustrated (as we have all been) but the apparent impossibility of settling some moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreeing on the formal and material propositions under dispute. The apparent impossibility of settling moral disagreements over weighty primary normative issues, like abortion, sexual ethics, torture, war, the proper uses of technology has become the defining datum of modern reflection on morality and ethics. 

There is a striking similarity between moral/philosophical disagreements and kinds of disagreements in natural sciences. Those familiar with the philosophy of science conversation about methodology and disagreement may notice this. MacIntyre certainly did. Thomas Kuhn’s watershed Structure of Scientific Revolutions challenges the widespread naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquires has been growing, steadily, in a straight line, since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. The paradigm is a research program around which many can unite as well as a stable scientific system of doctrine that can be added to or pruned. But lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm, once revolutionary, becomes the stable scientific system of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm.

His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call it MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] But unlike Kuhn, MacIntyre is not a postmodernist; while Feyerabend ended in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology, a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists, MacIntyre’s theory attempts to avoid relativism. Some would say he was unsuccessful. But this is getting ahead of myself.  

The fact is that people disagree about morals. Many metaethicists react such widespread, rampant, shrill, and apparently intractable moral disagreement by giving up on moral realism. The old project was a searching for the objective moral facts, the self-evident moral truths, or fundamental moral principles by which moral disagreements can be peaceably and reasonably settled without browbeating, censorship, name-calling, and ejection from the conversation.

12. Teleology or Deontology?
The received view is that Kant's moral philosophy is a deontological normative theory at least to this extent: it denies that right and wrong are in some way or other functions of goodness or badness. It denies, in other words, the central claim of teleological moral views. For instance, act consequentialism is one sort of teleological theory. It asserts that the right action is that action of all the alternatives available to the agent that has the best overall outcome. Here, the goodness of the outcome determines the rightness of an action. Another sort of teleological theory might focus instead on character traits. 'Virtue ethics' asserts that a right action in any given circumstance is that action a virtuous person does or would perform in those circumstances. In this case, it is the goodness of the character of the person who does or would perform it that determines the rightness of an action. In both cases, as it were, the source or ground of rightness is goodness. And Kant's own views have typically been classified as deontological precisely because they have seemed to reverse this priority and deny just what such theories assert. Rightness, on the standard reading of Kant, is not grounded in the value of outcomes or character.
There are several reasons why readers have thought that Kant denies the teleological thesis. First, he makes a plethora of statements about outcomes and character traits that appear to imply an outright rejection of both forms of teleology. For instance, in Groundwork I, he says that he takes himself to have argued that “the objectives we may have in acting, and also our actions' effects considered as ends and what motivates our volition, can give to actions no unconditional or moral worth…[this] can be found nowhere but in the principle of the will, irrespective of the ends that can be brought about by such action” (4: 400). This appears to say that moral rightness is not a function of the value of intended or actual outcomes. Kant subsequently says that a categorical imperative “declares an action to be objectively necessary of itself without reference to any purpose—that is, even without any further end” (4:415). A categorical imperative “commands a certain line of conduct directly, without assuming or being conditional on any further goal to be reached by that conduct” (4:416). These certainly appear to be the words of someone who rejects the idea that what makes actions right is primarily their relationship to what good may come of those actions, someone who rejects outright the act consequentialist form of teleology. Moreover, Kant begins the Groundwork by noting that character traits such as the traditional virtues of courage, resolution, moderation, self-control, or a sympathetic cast of mind possess no unconditional, moral worth, (4:393-94, 398-99). If the moral rightness of an action is grounded in the value of the character traits of the person who performs or would perform it, then it seems Kant thinks that it would be grounded in something of only conditional value. This certainly would not comport well with the virtue ethics form of teleology.
Second, there are, deeper theoretical claims and arguments of Kant's in both the Groundwork and in the second Critique that appear to be incompatible with any sort of teleological form of ethics. These claims and arguments all stem from Kant's insistence that morality is grounded in the autonomy of a rational will. For instance, Kant states that “if the will seeks the law that is to determine it anywhere else than in the fitness of its maxims for its own giving of universal law…heteronomy always results” (4:441) If the law determining right and wrong is grounded in either the value of outcomes or the value of the character of the agent, it seems it will not be found in the fitness of the action's maxim to be a universal law laid down by the agent's own rational will. And Kant's most complete treatment of value, the second Critique's “On the Concept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason”, appears to be a relentless attack on any sort of teleological moral theory. “The concept of good and evil” he states, “must not be determined before the moral law (for which, as it would seem, this concept would have to be made the basis) but only (as was done here) after it and by means of it” (5:63).
A number of Kant's readers have come to question this received view, however. Perhaps the first philosopher to suggest a teleological reading was John Stuart Mill. In the first chapter of his Utilitarianism, Mill implies that the Universal Law formulation of the Categorical Imperative could only sensibly be interpreted as a test of the consequences of universal adoption of a maxim. Several 20th century theorists have followed Mill's suggestion, most notably, R. M. Hare. Hare argued that moral judgments such as “Stealing is wrong” are in fact universal prescriptions (“No stealing anywhere by anyone!”) And because they are universal, Hare argued, they forbid making exceptions. That in turn requires moral judgments to give each person's wellbeing, including our own, equal weight. And when we give each person's wellbeing equal weight, we are acting to produce the best overall outcome. Thus, in his view, the CI is “simply utilitarianism put into other words” (Hare, 1993, p. 103). More recently, David Cummiskey (Cummiskey, 1996) has argued that Kant's view that moral principles are justified because they are universalizable is compatible with those principle themselves being consequentialist. Indeed, Cummiskey argues that they must be: respect for the value of Humanity entails treating the interests of each as counting for one and one only, and hence for always acting to produce the best overall outcome.
There are also teleological readings of Kant's ethics that are non-consequentialist. Barbara Herman has urged philosophers to “leave deontology behind” as an understanding of Kant's moral theory on the grounds that the conception of practical reason grounding the Categorical Imperative is itself a conception of value. Herman's idea is that Kant never meant to say that no value grounds moral principles. That, she argues, would imply that there would be no reason to conform to them. Instead, Kant thought the principles of rationality taken together constitute rational agency, and rational agency so constituted itself functions as a value that justifies moral action. (1993, 231) Herman's proposal thus has Kant's view grounding the rightness of actions in rational agency, and then in turn offering rational agency itself up as a value. Both Paul Guyer and Allen Wood have offered proposals that differ from Herman's in content, but agree on the general form of teleology that she defends as a reading of Kant. Guyer argues that autonomy itself is the value grounding moral requirements. Moral thinking consists in recognizing the priceless value of a rational agent's autonomous will, something in light of whose value it is necessary for any rational agent to modify his behavior (1998, 22-35). And Wood argues that humanity itself is the grounding value for Kant. While the second Critique claims that good things owe their value to being the objects of the choices of rational agents, they could not, in his view, acquire any value at all if the source of that value, rational agency, itself had no value. (1999, 130; see also pp. 157-8) Finally, Rae Langton has recently argued that if Kant's theory is to be thought of as an objectivistic view, we must suppose that the value of humanity and the good will are independent of simply being the objects of our rational choices. If their value thereby becomes the source of the rightness of our actions — say, our actions are right if and because they treat that self-standing value in various ways — then her reading too is teleological.
It is of considerable interest to those who follow Kant to determine which reading — teleological or deontological — was actually Kant's, as well as which view ought to have been his. A powerful argument for the teleological reading is the motivation for Herman's proposal: What rationale can we provide for doing our duty at all if we don't appeal to it's being good to do it? But a powerful argument for the deontological reading is Kant's own apparent insistence that the authority of moral demands must come simply from their being the demands of each person's own rational will, quite apart from the value that will may have. (see Schneewind, 1996, Johnson, 2007, 2008, also Reath, 1994) On the latter view, moral demands gain their authority simply because you yourself have, insofar as you are rational, willed them. Proponents of this reading are left with the burden of answering Herman's challenge to provide a rationale for having willed it. On the former view, by contrast, a rationale is at hand: because your will is, insofar as it is rational, good. Proponents of this former reading are then left with the burden of explaining how it could be the autonomy of the will alone that explains the authority of morality.

The central claim of Aristotelian naturalism is that moral goodness is a kind of species-specific natural goodness. Aristotelian naturalism has recently enjoyed a resurgence in the work of philosophers such as Philippa Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Michael Thompson. However, any view that takes moral goodness to be a type of natural goodness faces a challenge: Granting that moral goodness is natural goodness for human beings, why should we care about being good human beings? Given that we are rational creatures who can ‘step back’ from our nature, why should we see human nature as authoritative for us? This is the authority-of-nature challenge. In this essay, I state this challenge clearly, identify its deep motivation, and distinguish it from other criticisms of Aristotelian naturalism. I also articulate what I consider the best response, which I term the practical reason response. This response, however, exposes Aristotelian naturalism to a new criticism – that it has abandoned the naturalist claim that moral goodness is species-specific natural goodness. Thus, I argue, Aristotelian naturalists appear to face a dilemma: Either they cannot answer the authority-of-nature challenge, or in meeting the challenge they must abandon naturalism. Aristotelian naturalists might overcome this dilemma, but doing so is harder than some Aristotelians have supposed. In the final sections of the paper, I examine the difficulties in overcoming the dilemma, and I suggest ways that Aristotelians might answer the authority-of-nature challenge while preserving naturalism.









For more recent treatments of Aristotle's teleology, see Nussbaum (1978); Sorabji (1980); Baime (1980); and, most of all, Gotthelf (1976).

 

Barham 2011 — Teleological Realism in Biology

More specifically, I will be exploring the idea that teleological discourse, both in everyday life and in biological science, is best understood as describing real, objectively existing properties of biological systems, quite apart from human interests and conceptual schemes. This means the claim that—assuming a broadly realistic stance towards the objects of everyday and biological discourse—teleological phenomena should be viewed as being on an ontological par with such well-known biological phenomena as 1 On this distinction, see Lennox (1992). 2 locomotion, phagocytosis, photosynthesis, and the like. I will refer to this basic claim as “teleological realism in biology” (TRB, for short).

 

Neo-Aristotelian Ethical Naturalism

Rosalind Hursthouse
The proponents of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism (henceforth “Aristotelian naturalism” for short) include

Geach (1956, 1977), 
Anscombe because her work has influenced so many others. (Gaut [1997, 2002] should also be known as a significant contributor.) 

Foot (2001), 
Hursthouse (1999), 
McDowell (1995), 
MacIntyre (1999), 
Nussbaum (1993, 1995), and 
Thompson (1995); and also 

Brown, Adams,  

Their views are so unlike those of other proponents of ethical naturalism (see Naturalism, Ethical), and they occupy such an unfamiliar position in philosophy, that they are simultaneously criticized on at least two quite different bases. Some say they are not trying to offer naturalism at all, because they avowedly employ a moralized conception of human nature; some say they are trying to offer naturalism insofar as they offer a biological foundation for ethics, but that either this has counterintuitive upshots or the biology is Aristotle's and thereby pre-Darwinian and not a proper naturalistic foundation at all.





Neo-Aristotelian Naturalism and the Indeterminacy Objection

Philippa Foot’s virtue ethics remains an intriguing but divisive position in normative ethics. For some, the promise of grounding human virtue in natural facts is a useful method of establishing normative content. For others, the natural facts on which the virtues are established appear naively uninformed when it comes to the empirical details of our species. In response to this criticism, a new cohort of neo-Aristotelians like John Hacker-Wright attempt to defend Foot by reminding critics that the facts at stake are not claimed to be explanatory descriptions of the kind provided by empirical science. Instead, they are derived from a logical form that is presupposed when we categorize something as a living organism. Neo-Aristotelian naturalism is therefore said to be immune to the empirical defeaters put forward as criticism of the theory. I argue that neo-Aristotelians like Hacker-Wright can only rescue Foot’s naturalism from being uninformed by exposing it to an indeterminacy objection: if claims about human virtue are grounded in facts about our species other than those derived from science, then the position becomes immune to empirical defeaters at the cost of being unable to generate informative normative content.



Virtue and nature

Christopher W. Gowans
Social Philosophy and Policy 25 (1):28-55 (2008)
Abstract
The Neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse purports to establish a naturalistic criterion for the virtues. Specifically, by developing a parallel between the natural ends of nonhuman animals and the natural ends of human beings, they argue that character traits are justified as virtues by the extent to which they promote and do not inhibit natural ends such as self-preservation, reproduction, and the well-being of one’s social group. I argue that the approach of Foot and Hursthouse cannot provide a basis for moral universalism, the widely-accepted idea that each human being has moral worth and thus deserves significant moral consideration. Foot and Hursthouse both depict a virtuous agent as implicitly acting in accord with moral universalism. However, with respect to charity, a virtue they both emphasize, their naturalistic criterion (especially in the more elaborate form developed by Hursthouse) at best provides a warrant for a restricted form of charity that extends only to a limited number of persons. There is nothing in the natural ends of human beings, as Foot and Hursthouse understand these, that gives us a reason for having any concern for the well-being of human beings as such

Neo-Aristotelian Attempts to Bind Morality to Human Nature
Daniel Hirst
Emergent Australasian Philosophers 1 (1) (2008)
Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to examine recent neo-Aristotelian attempts to tie morality to human nature. I look specifically at the work in this field conducted by Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse. In particular, I articulate their distinct use of the word ‘good’ , and how in making this move they illuminate what we are doing when we make ethical evaluations. I then look at two pieces written by Julia Annas and Bernard Williams which attempt to criticise the neo-Aristotelian project. I ultimately defend the neo-Aristotelian argument that moral activity is on par with self-interested behaviour in any evaluation of practical rationality



Bradshaw — 
Be clear about metaphysical naturalism, hardcore naturalism, liberal naturalism, non-naturalism, supernaturalism — in the dissertation proposal. For Anita’s sake. 
Naturalism the broader depabte  — is framed in terms from the scientific revelation. Nature is this autonomous realm of law. It runs on its own. Does it need a higher explanatory principle. 
For the Greeks, nature is already divine. Nature is one of the names Aristotle uses when he’s already talking about God. 
Aristotle is the paradigm. Someone who grounds ethics in human nature. They call all those views ethical naturalism. if it’s true that it’s all built around Aristotle. It doesn’t fit well the other use of the term, it doesn’t fit well with the post-scientific revolution use of the term. Within writing the N. Ethics. 
The last chapter of the Eudaimian Ethics is more striking. The ultimate criterion of what’s good is whether it brings you closer to God. 
Natural law = non-natuarlism about epistemology? 
Two kinds of thomihtic natural law. Natural = defined by human nature. Some good we naturally seek, share with animals good sleep reproduction bodily comfort. 
Some goods we naturally seek as rational beings, knowledge, society, knowledge of God. In that question, Bradshaw thinks, he’s very stoic in how he frames these things, it’s human nature that makes us naturally seek these things. 
So how do you adjudicate among them? He doesn’t say. Frustrating. Higher goods don’t always trump lower goods. You might starve if you seek knowledge. 
if you get into larger society these conflicts are rampant. Doesn’t give means of adjudicating. ‘

They say some things that are similar to that particular question in the Summa. But they don’t tie it to human reason. But they tie it to practical reason. 8 things: Health, physical well-being, social interaction, knowledge, religion… pseudo-Kantian version of Aquinas? In that it emphasises practical reason.

Is reason instrumental? Or platonic/aristotelian?

Talbot Brewer: “Philosophical ethics is widely thought to consist in an inquiry into the nature, source, and content of moral reasons for action, including those overriding reasons we call duties or obligations. This putative class of reasons is often distinguished by contrast with reasons of self-interest.” (Brewer 2009)
“Philosophical ethics… becomes self-formative activity in its own right… it ceases to be “mere theory” and becomes an intensified form of a vital life activity. If we think of ethical philosophy in this way, we gain further insight into the significance of the fact that as a field it makes so little progress. It is not the sort of activity that could yield findings that could be learned by future generations so as to spare them the trouble of engaging in the activity for themselves.” (Brewer, The Retrieval of Ethics, 2009)
“If philosophy is an intrinsically valuable and potentially focal activity rather than a communicable expertise, then perhaps we should not be greatly troubled by the field’s lack of progress, just as we are not greatly troubled by lack of progress in friendship or sex or art.
Preoccupations for the health of the field might fruitfully be directed to the question whether the practice is surviving in a vital and uncorrupted form rather than to the question whether our mode of engagement is adding to a stock of settled findings or insights that can be handed to the next generation.” (Brewer, The Retrieval of Ethics, 2009)

            <Text>### Solutions: Virtue ethics  ###

Macintyre is widely considered to be a “critic of modernity.” And he certainly is that. But he is widely considered by his detractors to be nothing but a critic. Anyone more than passingly familiar with his writings know he is also a powerful positive voice for *improving* modernity. His positive positions contribute toward continuing moral progress. At the risk of sounding paradoxical, we might put it this way: MacIntyre's positive ethical positions are *traditional* but not *nostalgic.* In fact, his definition of tradition as an ongoing, socially-embedded argument over time entails necessarily that moral inquiry is dynamic, progressive, and even *modern*. For, to be traditional is not to be past-oriented; to be traditional is to be staunchly future-oriented, since the business of life is not only the pursuit of our telos but the transmission of everything valuable and precious to the next generation. 


The "*After Virtue* Project" is mostly constructive and creative. But up to and including *After Virtue*, MacIntyre may be seen as working to articulate criticisms that lead eventually to his epistemological and moral crisis. *After Virtue* and many of the works after have emphasized how and why to restore the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of virtue. The sequels *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Dependent Rational Animals* deepen and clarify MacIntyre’s commitment to that tradition and extend that tradition into the future. 

### Progress ###

The solution toward which MacIntyre was inexorably lead over the years was that we moderns need to recover the broadly Aristotelian tradition of the virtues. 

But, again, we must beware a misunderstanding. Any talk of “returning” is liable to sound nostalgic. MacIntyre's proposed solution is not an anti-progressive longing for the past. It is radically progressive. His solution is not to reverse progress but to abandon the standard of progress set up in the Enlightenment and to continue under an alternative standard of progress.

While I defer a detailed discussion of tradition until below, here I will say that traditions are living debates between social communities across time. They are, by definition, *still alive*. Traditions are not dead memories of the past but the cutting edge of forward-facing communities actively involved in self-definition and the pursuit of goods. </Text>

### MacIntyre’s Project: An Invitation to Restore Virtue ###

The abiding theme of MacIntyre's ethical writings has been the invitation to give up on the hopeless elements of our modern liberal tradition and to return to Aristotelian (and Thomistic) tradition of virtue. This invitation assumes that our modern tradition is fatally flawed, that some parts at least are hopeless; and it assumes that the tradition of virtue will cure what ails. It also assume that moderns — even putatively “anti-traditionalist” moderns — a part of a “tradition.” I shall comment on both of these assumptions below. 

#### Audience

MacIntyre’s ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. 

#### Influence

MacIntyre's influence has been remarkable. Many have declined this invitation, but many have accepted it. Those who decline are more or less content with modern ethical and political thinking, offering corrections and improvements but not major overhaul; they find  MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. Those who accept tend to be more dissatisfied with the present modern culture, modern morality, and modern politics. 

### Philosophical Imagination

The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) is not a demand -- it really is an *invitation.* Readers who are discontent with modern culture and morality may well find MacIntyre's solutions compelling. Readers who are not so discontent may find something of interest in his criticisms; if not, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would this be a good solution?"

###Assumption 1: We all have a tradition ###

What is a tradition? An extended, socially-embedded argument deriving from a source text and continuing across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). 

One might question whether “we” (Anglo-American westerners) inhabit a “tradition” at all. But MacIntyre points out that we do. It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives” in the popular sense.) For simplicity, I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ in most instances to describe this tradition. 


Modernity is a political movement. That is, modernity is a global human phenomenon, for it began with scientific, religious, and political shifts in Europe and caused cultural and intellectual shifts and furthered seismic shifts in science, religion, and politics. Even so, politics is perhaps the clearest marker of modernity; rise of the modern state is perhaps the greatest sign of modernity’s conquest of the western mind, heart, and imagination. As evidence of this suggestion, we can remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Hence, MacIntyre’s critique of modernity has political as well as social and ethical aspects. 

### Modernity is hopeless ###

Throughout MacIntyre’s oeuvre, his abiding conviction is that something is terribly wrong with modernity and it needs restorative resources from outside itself. I would like to briefly present an outline of this critique. It will make more intelligible the virtue theory to come. 

From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] But rather than embracing a thorough, cynical, postmodern sort of nihilism, however, MacIntyre (perhaps surprisingly) discovered an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue, and eventually Thomism, that MacIntyre continues to build. 

MacIntyre compared modern moral discourse to catastrophe, where only fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive in states of increasing decay. He says: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

But the catastrophe did not affect only academic disciplines. It affects human culture. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the appearance of having a dialectical case for their value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any normative point you can think of (the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation), but they also disagree on normative frameworks (deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism), and on metaethical points (moral realism, moral epistemology, moral semantics), and more. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreeing on the formal and material propositions under dispute. The apparent impossibility of settling moral disagreements over weighty primary normative issues, like abortion, sexual ethics, torture, war, the proper uses of technology has become the defining datum of modern reflection on morality and ethics. 

Rather than despair, MacIntyre noticed that similar disagreement has marked discussions in the natural sciences. This observation proved extremely fruitful. 

Briefly, Thomas Kuhn’s watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* challenges the widespread naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquires has been growing, steadily, in a straight line, since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. The paradigm is a research program around which many can unite as well as a stable scientific system of doctrine that can be added to or pruned. But lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm, once revolutionary, becomes the stable scientific system of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyerabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call it MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] But Kuhn and Feyerabend ended in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology, a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. MacIntyre ended in a thoroughgoing, optimistic, progressive, anti-relativistic Thomism. 

This parallel explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. MacIntyre’s ethical theory is both extremely cognizant of historical background and extremely cognizant of methodology; some have thought his ethics (of the good) collapses into epistemology (a means of rationally identifying the good). The thought is a mistake, but an understandable one. An understandable mistake that also happens in the philosophy of science. 

This comparison between ethical *crises* and scientific crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. </Text>

            <Text>### Main question
This chapter focuses on MacIntyre’s “*After Virtue* Project”. The governing questions are these: What is MacIntyre's account of virtue? What is MacIntyre’s ethical project? What are the primary objections to his ethical project or its account of virtue? And how plausible is his account of virtue, after these objections have been taken seriously?

As I shall treat MacIntyre, his central ethical insights are twofold: First, that Enlightenment, modern morality got off track by exorcizing telos from morality. Intelligible, rational, socially-applicable Aristotelian morality includes human nature as it is, human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-its-telos, and practical morality which facilitates the transformation from the former to the latter. This surgical removal is unjustified and disastrous. 

Secondly, the restoration of telos into morality restores moral intelligibility, not to mention social order. The fundamental objection his critics have had is to query: How can telos be restored? How can virtues which are only intelligible in light of teleology be restored if telos can’t be? Either through metaphysical biology or the metaphysics of *practice*. Call the first natural teleology and the second “social teleology.” Telos must be natural, real, and non-imaginary. Telos is even “scientific” (contra Jean Hampton) if we include the social, biological, and computational sciences as ‘sciences’. Social teleology which is rooted in the metaphysics of action satisfies these criteria. Biological or natural teleology (to say nothing of cosmic teleology) satisfies these criteria too, but we shall examine that prospect in the upcoming chapter. MacIntyre takes the latter course.

	In order to make clear MacIntyre’s central claim — that social teleology underwrites virtue and makes morality intelligible, useful, and rational — we must explore his broader project and examine some of his central topics, such as *practice, life, and tradition-bound rationality.*</Text>

            <Text>### Outline of chapter ###

I shall attempt to provide adequate answers to these questions by dividing the chapter into the following sections. 

**Section 1 Project** — What is MacIntyre’s project? In order to make sense of MacIntyre’s account of virtue, we must step back a bit. Section 1 therefore tells some of the backstory that makes MacIntyre’s account of virtue intelligible. It explores MacIntyre’s accounts of epistemological crisis, tradition, and moral inquiry. The primary error of modern morality was its rejection of, or rather misunderstanding of, teleology. Modern moralities (especially Kant and Mill) attempt to retain the semblance of teleology without the substance. But it has not, and will never, work. Although such moralists claim to deny teleology they invoke it in their theories and inconsistently use everyday common sense moral concepts that *are* functional and teleological. 

**Section 2 Virtue** — What is MacIntyre’s account of virtue? This section summarizes MacIntyre’s preliminary definition of virtue as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices”[@macintyre1984after 191] and explores the expanded definition that invokes tradition. Tradition-constituted rationality undergirds the philosophical search for an adequate and useful ethics. 


**Section 3 Objections** — What are the objections to MacIntyre’s ethical project or his account of virtue? I voice a select few of the many objections that readers and scholars have posed.  Some “objections” are really demands for clarification on MacIntyre’s claims, though others certainly dispute those claims. Section 3 therefore asks whether MacIntyre’s virtue ethics is relative to tradition, whether his concept of tradition is coherent, and whether his account of virtue assumes a discredited teleological metaphysics of Aristotle. 

Is there really a theory of practice that can underwrite “second nature” — a social teleology, or does teleology need to be a part of “primary nature”. 

**Section 4 Replies** — How plausible is MacIntyre’s account of virtue?  In the final section, I shall carefully endorse part and reject part of MacIntyre's account. 

For instance, I reject part of his notion that virtues are relative to changing traditions rather than a stable human nature. And I endorse the thesis that human practice is teleological and hence that non-teleological ethics are either false or (in the end) *actually* covertly teleological, but defer the question of the relationship between *social* teleology and *physical*,  biological, natural, or metaphysical teleology.

            <Title>Three Rival Versions</Title>
            <Text>Section Three Rival Versions
Richard Cain (2008) summarizes MacIntyre’s clarification of tradition in this way: “For MacIntyre, the concepts distinctive of a particular historically embedded moral system are embodied in and draw meaning from particular forms of social practice. Practices in turn find their meanings and their developments in an ongoing narrative of stability and transformation within the history of a particular society. It is precisely the process of handing on these practices and narratives that constitutes a tradition. Traditions also help one understand the dynamic relationship between individuals as receivers of practices and narratives from their society and individuals as critical evaluators who sometimes alter or even reject moral resources available to them within their society and its constituting tradition. The passing on or breakdown of traditions also help explain the formation, maintenance, and development or decay of the particular norms of practical rationality that underpin moral enquiry and action within a society.”Cain, Cogito, 269-270, 2008.

Section Introduction 3RV
In Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry, MacIntyre challenged himself and others to pick one out of these rivals. What distinguishes the three is their treatment of history. Genealogy uses the past as a weapon against the present; it tells stories about our ancestors that poison the well against us, that undermine any theorizing whatsoever, including its own. Encyclopedia uses the present as a weapon against the past; it arrogates state-of-the-art “facts” to poison the well against our ancestors, undermining the trunk of which it is itself a branch. Neither of these will do. Each, in different ways, undermines itself even on its own terms. Even those within that version of moral inquiry can see, from within, the error. 
The third option is tradition. Tradition uses the past as (potentially) a help and guide to the present, and uses the present as (potentially at least) a help to the past. The past should not be a chain or uncrossable fence, but a starting point, a set of “givens.” The stereotype of “traditional people” is that they glorify and fixate on the past; in the present, then, they aim merely to repeat the past. Such people should not be called traditional but archeological: they aim to uncover and preserve relics or to replicate them. MacIntyre is truly traditionalist: a tradition is a thing pass on. In that way, we in the present must press into the future but must not let ourselves start over every day, beginning again from scratch, like the amnesiac in the movies. The present should press into the future, doing better what ancestors tried but perhaps could not do. The present should also always recognize that it is not final and encyclopedic, that it will need the help of some other (future) present. 
The chapters comprising this dissertation are something of a mix, in MacIntyre’s terms, between encyclopedia and tradition. I take the state-of-the-art within philosophical ethics to include virtue ethics as one of three major options. 
At the same time, theorizing about virtue and attempting to live virtuously is part of a much broader tradition than mere philosophical ethics. That tradition, that culture, that community, is engaged in a social project of living well according to a shared conception of what “well” means. And for that tradition, culture, community, engaging in ethical theorizing and arguing with other theorists over (say) various definitions of virtue, over moral realism, moral knowledge, moral motivation, etc. are only part and perhaps not even a big part of living well. 
I myself belong to that tradition — in turns Aristotelian, Augustinian, Platonic, Thomistic, American, and so on. I make no apologies for my membership, but I do wish to restrict myself as much as possible from employing all the resources of that tradition. I aim, as far as possible, to bracket those additional resources available to me, and those with me, since they are not available to those outside the tradition. I aim, in other words, to see just how much those of us from rival traditions can do with each other, and how many important questions we can hope to settle, without the benefit of a shared tradition. </Text>

            <Text>Symptoms of Illness
The first and most obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.MacIntyre, After Virtue 6. Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in a despair of ever reaching agreement. We have already had occasion to observe that one of the persistent and urgent questions metaethicists attempt to answer is why people disagree. And we have noted the parallel between ethical paradigms and scientific paradigms. 
The dual aspect of modern moral philosophy is that disputants on either side purport to be presenting the objective moral truth and they possess no unavailable rational standard for supporting their own view, let alone convincing others on purely rational or evidential grounds.  Individually, these aspects are not puzzling: One pattern is that when I meet people who do not share my tastes or preferences, I do not browbeat; I simply I live and let live. Another pattern is that when I meet people whom I view as ignorant or mistaken,  I try to persuade them by appealing to evidence to ascribe to the same rational, putatively objective standards I endorse But moral discourse doesn’t fit either of these non-puzzling patterns. how can my own, arbitrary, unaccountable opinions and preferences form the basis for browbeating those who do not share the same opinions and preferences as if they were not just different from me but ignorant and mistaken? Moral discourse with its expression of moral disagreement still retain the appearance of rationality at the same time that the seem to have given up on the rationality and publically-accessible nature of morality. 
MacIntyre provocatively interprets this dual phenomenon as exactly what one would expect from a society and culture that was formerly unified and is no a shattered and fragmented shipwreck of that former unity.MacIntyre, After Virtue 8. Moral discourse has indeed historically been a species of rational discourse, but it is no longer. 
Certainly, emotivism (or more broadly expressivism) would also explain shrill, widespread, intractable moral disagreement. That explanandum is indeed historically the justification for its genesis.A. J. Ayer, Language, Truth and Logic, 1936; and C. L. Stevonson 1945. And expressivists have provided powerful and insightful analyses of the features of moral thought and language. However indebted we are to the non-cognitivists for their detailed research on these points, we do not have to believe the core thesis that prescribing, emoting, expressing, etc., are all that moral discourse does. We can concede that these speech-acts are important parts while denying that they are the whole. 

Rational Moralities are emotivist too
At this point of the story, MacIntyre’s allegation that expressivism fails to explain moral disagreement might be taken as a cue to start arguing for (morally realist) moral rationalism. But even the putative alternative to emotivism, according to MacIntyre, shares an assumption with emotivism. The alternative is to attempt to justify particular moral claims by appeal to higher level moral principles.MacIntyre, After Virtue 20  %. But if the “terminus of justification” is “a choice unguided by criteria” then even the “utterance of any universal principle is in the end an expression of the preferences of an individual will and for that will its principles have and can have only such authority as it chooses to confer upon them by adopting them. Thus emotivism has not been left very far behind after all.MacIntyre, After Virtue   21 %. 
In this interpretation of Moore, MacIntyre is not crazy. Some have argued that Moore’s non-naturalism and intuitionism have become the inheritance not of non-naturalist realists (like Shafer-Landau) but expressivists. Expressivists are all too happy to concede the point that goodness cannot be discovered by any of our standard ways of knowing. They take the best explanation of that fact to be that goodness is not a property at all. 
Rather than argue for rationalism, MacIntyre sees appeals to rationality as themselves part of the illness. The “predecessor culture”, the Enlightenment culture of which Moore et. al. are descendeents, was already sick. The very notion of rationality is constituted by traditions. 
In pre-Enlightenment Europe moralities were in wide agreement. Although the content of morality was widely shared (promise-keeping, marriage, family, justice are all unquestioned goods for Diderot, Kierkegaard, Hume, and Kant) the social and traditional unity undergirding them was dissolving. </Text>

            <Notes>“MacIntyre convincingly proves that rationality and ethics are inseparable; that it is impossible for the unjust person to think rationally, or for the irrational person to be just. Consequently, the liberal presumption of a shared, ahistorical, “objective” rationality which can be brought to bear to resolve differences in values and conceptions of justice, is a delusion.”

            <Title>Section II: The Key Questions </Title>
            <Text>	◦	Why by virtuous? 
For MacIntyre, the moral skeptic is estranged from the community. 
	When philosophers pose the skeptical challenge “why be moral?” they are most often speaking in quotes. They are letting the debonair amoralist or the brick-headed moral dunce speak. They are forcing themselves to meet a challenge, even if it is mostly or entirely a hypothetical one.
	Many of us have actually confronted moral skeptics. Those of us who not only “do philosophy” professionally but also teach non-philosopher undergraduates or high school age, and engage in intellectual dialogue with friends for fun, have confronted moral skepticism in the hearts and minds of human beings. But this skepticism in the wild is rarely idenitcal to the petri-dish variety of our thought-experiments. Actual moral skeptics, in my experience, are only skeptical about one or two pet issues: sexuality and politics. They might think it morally acceptable to steal from a corporation (because they are already stealing from us) but they don’t think anyone should steal from them. 
	What is not often the case is that the portrait of the debonair immoralist is painted with any literary detail. Who is he? Where does he come from? Where are his family? If we answered these questions, we might learn something important about the abstract questions of moral motivation. 
	Moral psychologists study a phenomenon that, I think, we can all observe: growing up in a family and with friends causes a majority of moral development. We learn our first deontological rules from our parents. We first have the fear of God put in us, those who fear God, by our God-fearing parents. But we also learn our first utilitarian principles from our siblings, friends, classmates, playmates, distant cousins, and — in a word, our peers. 
	Davidson and Youniss, interpreting Piaget’s The Moral Judgment of the Child, argue that “the construction of identity and the construction of morality are aspects of the same construction.” (1991, 112). In other words, MacIntyre’s close tie between the self (as a narrative unity), practical reason, and morality is justifiable on empirical psychological grounds as well. 
	Apply this close tie to the amoralist or the moral skeptic. Do they have a home country, a family? John “Jack” Ames from Marilynn Robinson’s Gilead is an apparent amoralist. Yet we know his family, the Boughton family, well. The unconditional love that Lila and the elder John Ames have for Jack eventually does seem to have an effect on him. But his behavior is both an expression of his self and forms his (new, different) self. 
	The question “why be moral?” is, for those with a clear sense of self and a strong community, almost unthinkable. Not that there is no answer, but that the answer is so obvious the question becomes bizarre and bewildering. So, briefly, for MacIntyre, we can say that the answer to “why be moral?” in the proper social and ethical context is for us like the question “Why be yourself?” An answer may be possible, but it would be halting, awkward, and difficult. More likely than answering such a question, the virtuous agent with a clear sense of self rooted in a narrative about the community and the agent’s place within it would return the question, “Why would anyone ever consider not being themselves? Why would anyone ever consider not being moral?” 
 

Is virtue ethics a species of moral realism (if so, constructivist or stance-independent)? 
Clearly, for MacIntyre, moral discourse can and should be a species of realism. But not all of it is. Namely, the kind of discourse that masks a will-to-power only pretends to realistic construal. 

What do evaluative terms mean?
Evaluative terms are like functional terms; their meaning is, in part, a reference to the referent’s function or telos.
“teleological language is frequently used in biology in order to make statements about the functions of organs, about physiological processes, and about the behavior and actions of species and individuals.” (Ernst Mayr, 1974)
“Pittenridght”  that the objects of biological analysis are organizations (he calls them organism and, as such, are end-directed. Organization is more than mere order; order lacks end-directedness; organization is end-directed.”

There are a host of homogenous classes that are spoken of in terms that might be teleological. 
	1.	The turtle walked ashore to lay her eggs — behavior of whole organism
	2.	The kidney filtered blood — function of organ within organism
	3.	During mitosis, a cell’s chromatic material is arranged in a single linear thread in order to ensure equal division of the smallest parts (Roux 1883) — the function of a microbiological process
	4.	The torpedo in the warehouse is for shooting through water toward a target — a potential end-directed behavior, a design
	◦	Is normativity natural? Is nature normative or teleological? (No Natural Teleology Objection)
	◦	What is human nature?  Is there a human nature? (No Human Nature Objection)
	◦	How do we know what is virtuous to do or be?
We have to listen to what our tradition tells us about what to do. If our present tradition is in crisis, then we may need to listen to what a rival tradition tells us about our present tradition.

            <Text>Humanity and nature
The question of value’s relation to nature collapses into the question of humanity’s relation to (the rest of) nature. 

Humanize value, naturalize humanity
There seem to be two options. Reduce value to nature in one step, or reduce value to human nature, and assume human nature is already reduced to or definitionally part of nature. The latter is two steps: humanize value, naturalize humanity.
Some ethical naturalists are content to relegate all value to humanity (all value thought and talk) and leave it at that. I do not think this kind of “naturalizing” is in the spirit of naturalism. The spirit of naturalism, the underlying motivation of naturalists from Lucretius to Dewey to Quine and Putnam, is to quite simply match the unified manifold, the unbroken harmony, the single continuous spectrum of nature or all of existence with a unified body of knowledge, a single science or harmonious set of sciences, a continuous spectrum of human knowledge all gathered together in one place, like the many leaves of Sybil’s book. 

For this reason panpsychists are naturalists despite being sounding quite weird to physicalists.
For this reason reductive materialists are naturalists despite denying much of what “experience” or common sense suggests about the first-person perspective, about free will, about rational judgment and so on. 
For this reason also evolutionary naturalists or emergent naturalists ground all the special features of humans in the organizational complexity of our biology: Chemicals and elements, at a level of complexity and organization, become living matter. Brains, at an appropriate level of complexity and organization or structure, become conscious matter — still more complex and organized, self-concious matter. And at that moment, nature has an “inside.” Consciousness — our consciousness — is nature becoming aware of itself. 


Demystifying human nature
For neo-Aristotelians, while first values were radically discontinuous with “normal” natural facts, now values are part and parcel of human nature, and that’s that. But this relegation ironically doesn’t naturalize value but “non-naturalizes” humanity. It leaves humanity radically discontinuous with nature. 

Some try to naturalize values by just putting them all  (or discovering them all) within humans. Ultimately, I don't think this strategy works. 

In sort, “humanizing” mysterious values doesn’t naturalize those values, it mystifies humans. It doesn't demystify values, it re-locates the mystery. If all these mysterious non-factual value thingies floating around with no apparent connection or meaning in the natural world are all somehow internal to human nature, and humans are natural, then all those values are natural, right? Yes, or human nature has just become non-natural. We used to have a "fact/value" split but now we have a "fact/human" split. 

To see how human rising values doesn't demystify values that actually makes humans mysterious, consider the cycle of euphemism. A phenomenon like human fecal matter is impolite to talk about. So we invent a euphemism like "feces." The euphemism works for referring to the same stuff without impoliteness for awhile. Then some kids get ahold of the term, realize what it means, and (having no taste) find it uproariously funny. They make enough jokes to *impolitisize* the polite term, shucking its dignified veneer. We invent another euphemism like "scat". To my knowledge, no one has yet turned "scat" into an exclamation expressing surprise or disapproval.  

To his credit, McDowell sees the parity of epistemic and moral norms. He wants to subjectivize moral norms, so he accordingly subjectivizes epistemic norms. Virtue and reason are *both* transcendental idealized processes, intersubjective human processes, objective enough for our purposes and to explain the objective purport in our thinking, feeling, and acting, but subjective enough to respect the distinction between human nature ("second nature") and *nature* nature (primary nature). 

Even so, second nature remains radically discontinuous from primary nature. Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. 

To preserve continuity, either humanity must be seen to be just as value-free as McDowell’s “bald nature,” or nature must be seen to be just as value-laden as human nature. I take the later course. 

I put the dilemma simply (for brevity if not for clarity) here:  

1. Human nature is continuous with nature. (Naturalism thesis)
2. Either nature as a whole is normative (normativity is natural) or humans are not normative (not ethical, value-laden, enchanted) (Normativity dilemma).
3. Humans are ethical by definition — we cannot but engage in normative discourse, thought, and action. (Moral realism thesis).
4. Nature is ethical, value-laden, enchanted, etc. (conclusion

Either nature is normative or normativity is “merely” natural. That is, normativity in general is different from factuality. Factuality is “natural” and so normativity is, by contrast, not like that — presumably not natural. So it either doesn’t exist or is reducible to nature. 

Now for some, to stomach a re-enchanted nature is too much. I shall challenge that squeamishness. Why? Is it a fear of supernaturalism, the “threat” of supernaturalism McDowell speaks of? If so, I undertake the question of whether this kind of neo-Aristotelianism can be compatible with atheism, and answer in the affirmative. If it is true, no one should reject it for fear of truth leading to some other belief. 

Note that the structure of this argument is parallels an argument that motivates panpsychists. If mind is natural and radically different from matter (where emergence is disputed) then mind must “be there” from the beginning. I don’t wish to strengthen or weaken my case by reference to the parallel, but simply to mention it. The panpsychists are right to dispute the emergence of consciousness which is something (a) so radically different from all the sub-atomic particles, elements, chemicals, chemical compounds, organisms and organs in the cosmos and (b) such a dramatically late-comer in the cosmos, taking billions of years to emerge. They are wrong to place all the emphasis on consciousness. A better place to dispute is the emergence of natural normativity. Normatively had to be there from the beginning. As Thomas Nagel argues, telos had to be there. Or so I will argue. </Text>

            <Text># Alasdair MacIntyre: Virtue in Practice 

### Introduction ###

Alasdair MacIntyre (born 1929) is an influential moral and political philosopher. His eighteen books and greater than three hundred published articles have indelibly impacted analytic ethics. 

### Ideal
MacIntyre embodies the ideal Roy Sellars commended, that the philosopher “should be well-grounded both in the history of philosophy and in the sciences, and... should engage philosophically with the major moral, social, and political issues of the day.”[@mcdonoughroy] 

### Breadth of influence
Refusing to restrict himself to a single topic, MacIntyre has contributed to virtue ethics, communitarianism, the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education; but he has contributed to other fields outside philosophy strictly defined, including sociology and literary analysis. 

Due in part to this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. One can find citations of his work not only in philosophy but in sociology, medicine, business ethics, political philosophy, bioethics, and more. His books have been translated into several languages and have had an especially significance influence in China. The International Society of MacIntyrean Enquiry holds annual conferences in his honor. 

### Style
Refusing to restrict himself to a strict style, his work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations. For example, he paints a memorable picture of emotivism as a “culture” with its own paradigmatic “characters”: the Manager and the Therapist.[@macintyre1984after chapter 3] 

### Transitions, adjustments
His career has been characterized by a long evolution within and across various schools of thought. He has adjusted (and in some cases, retracted) his affiliations. For example, he began his career as a Marxist, before “converting” to Aristotelianism, and most recently “converting” to Christianity and Thomism.  

### Did for ethics what Rawls did
 Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.]  

### More on influence
But it is worth noting at the outset that these conclusions are as radical as they are popular. MacIntyre’s ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. And, to the surprise of some, his influence has been marked. Those who accept his invitation tend to be more dissatisfied with the present modern culture, modern morality, and modern politics. Such may find his solutions compelling. However, MacIntyre never writes in such a way as to presume to *compel* (neither by reason nor rhetoric) anyone to believe his theory. 

### How he reaches out to his audience
The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) really is an *invitation* — it is not a *demand.*  He does not *force* anyone to play by his rules, to accept his definitions of terms. Many have declined his invitation to restore the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Those who decline tend to be more or less content with modern ethical and political thinking as it is. The changes they want to make are corrections and improvements, sometimes extensive changes, but nothing approaching an overhaul. Therefore, they tend to find  MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites readers who are not discontent with modernity to self-reflect and to reflect on our common history. They may find something of interest in his criticisms. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would something like this be a good solution?"

### Still evolving

But he is still writing and still thinking. Those who familiar with the expansiveness of his research will not be too quick to declare that his evolution is finished. The full significance of his legacy remains to be seen. I shall offer some tentative predictions at the end of this chapter. 


### Two main themes: history and practical reason
Yet two of his most oft-recurring thematic points have had widespread impact: the first is that ethical terms, concepts, and judgments have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical (and more broadly, evaluative) terms, concepts, and judgments when we have some historical perspective on them. We must know ourselves as members of a “tradition”, that is, a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. 

 A second thematic point is that moral reasoning is a species of practical reasoning *tout court*. That is, moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself. Together, these two themes have guided MacIntyre’s conclusions. 

His commitments to thinking through ethical concepts in tandem with concepts of rationality, and thinking through both in historical/traditional perspective lead him to endorse a set of specific conclusions. Three of those conclusions will be our theme in this chapter. 

I would like to give a cursory statement the primary conclusions under discussion. The first is that we are members of the tradition of liberalism, modernity, the Enlightenment. That slippery word 'we' should be taken, here, to refer to MacIntyre’s western, English-speaking or European readers.

His second conclusion is that modern moral philosophy since the Enlightenment has gotten off track. Compared to the moral, social, and political unity of previous generations or of other cultures in our own time, the last several hundred years of modernity in the west have been a mix of good and bad, but the bad has been disastruous. In fact, philosophical ethics have become unintelligible. If morality is a set of rules, actions, or character traits that are admirable or praiseworthy, then intelligible morality cannot but exist within a nexus of two other concepts: human-nature-as-it-is (identified with help from psychology, sociology, etc.) *and* a conception of “human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-achieved-its-telos”. Our modern, liberal, Enlightenment tradition (which we shall explicate below) got off track, largely due to the attempt to banish *telos* or intrinsic purposes from morality. Opposition to teleology has rendered the virtues, moral duties, praiseworthy actions unintelligible. MacIntyre invites his readers, especially those who already, for independent reasons, find the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition fatally flawed, to give up on its hopeless elements. 

A third conclusion follows from the first two. The restoration of historical perspective and of thinking of ethical reasoning as a species of practical reasoning promises that the restoration of *telos* might make available resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The promise of such a restoration and recovery is immense. A conception of human nature as it is combined with a clear conception of the potential of human nature would lead to a restoration of moral intelligibility.  The restoration of *telos* would make morality intelligible again, which would undergird a restoration of social and political integrity. If the point of education, politics, and social life were once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, these activities and pursuits would become intelligible in ways that many modern folk can hardly imagine. 

These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.


### Chapter outline

This chapter is divided into four sections. 

**Section 1: Tradition and history**. Section 1 sets the foundation for MacIntyre’s theory of virtue and practical wisdom that he offers as a cure for what ills modern moral philosophy. First, I shall explain MacIntyre’s assumption that we moderns — even putatively “anti-traditionalist” moderns — are part of a “tradition,” and explicate his belief that our modern tradition is fatally flawed. I will tell part of MacIntyre’s personal history, his epistemological crises, that helps make sense of his eventual theories.

**Section 2: Virtue**.  Section 2 summarizes and discusses MacIntyre’s theory of virtue as presented in his four main virtue books. I shall present his positive account of virtue in historical perspective. I shall be required to summarize a set of related supporting concepts. These uphold his account of virtue. They are: practices, the self and its narrative of human life, human nature, *telos*, tradition, and practical rationality. 

**Section 3: Objections**. Section 3 presents a sampling of the powerful objections critics have offered to various aspects of MacIntyre’s theory.  Also, I shall try to identify the main types of critic — crudely put, they are modernists, postmodernists, and MacIntyre’s own fellow Thomists. While it will be impossible to do justice to the excellent replies from MacIntyre's sizable crowd of friends and opponents, I shall  focus on what three of what I take to be three families of superlatively important challenges. The first family of objections pertains to moral  relativism; many worry that MacIntyre has undercut any possibility of intelligibly defending the robust moral realism inherent to the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The second family of objections pertains to rationality and tradition (which are inextricably related in MacIntyre’s work, as we shall see); some worry that his theory of rationality is plainly incoherent.  Others worry that it is coherent but that MacIntyre’s espousing of it *while* arguing his particular ethical conclusions amounts to a performative contradiction. The third family of objections pertains to teleology and the concept of *telos*; some worry that trying to shoehorn teleology back into ethics, even if it were desirable to do so, will require accepting tenets from a discredited Aristotelian metaphysics of nature; others argue that ethics can get along well enough without any need for *telos*. 

**Section 4: Discussion**. Section 4 discusses these various objections and considers whether  MacIntyre’s virtue theory contains the resources with which to answer them satisfactorily.  While I cannot claim to finally calm the worries of his critics, I argue that each of these three families of objections can be answered. I take 'relativism' to be a constellation of theses to the effect that no one person’s or culture’s conception of virtue is rationally superior to any other’s. MacIntyre's account of virtue and rationality has the resources to avoid this; so it is not, at the end of the day, relativistic. Secondly, his notion of tradition-constituted rationality, while frustratingly open to interpretation (by philosophers from varying traditions!) is ultimately a powerful and useful framework with which to explain the paradoxical phenomena of widespread moral disagreement *alongside* widespread moral agreement. Thirdly, the needed type of teleology for MacIntyre’s proposed restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue is credible within our context of modern science, so long as we carefully distinguish various possible types of ‘teleology’ (e.g., there are at least four: cosmic, metaphysical, biological, and social teleologies). With all that said, I shall argue that we should expect any “answer” to such fundamental worries to expose deep metaphilosophical fault lines. So, I shall caution MacIntyre’s allies and enemies to be cautious about hastily labeling each other as “unphilosophical” on the basis of an inability — at the moment — of finally adjudicating these disputes. I shall close this chapter with a reflection on why some find MacIntyre’s philosophical ethics so infuriating and easy to misunderstand. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


## Tradition and history ##

My goal in this chapter is to make an adequate presentation MacIntyre's account of virtue. However, it would be unwise quickly to dive in to that presentation without two preliminaries. To see why, consider two of his early (and by no means final) formulations of a definition of virtue: virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] And secondly:

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]

These formulations define virtue in terms of "practices" that an individual engages in throughout his or her "whole life", all in context of a "tradition". These three concepts -- practice, life, and tradition -- are constitutive parts of MacIntyre's account of virtue. While discussions of *practice* and *life* can wait, I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain *tradition* at the outset. Thankfully, a brief preliminary explanation will suffice for now. More details will emerge as they are needed.

### We inhabit a tradition ###

MacIntyre maintains that every inquirer inhabits a tradition. What does this mean? First we must take the point in its least controversial and hence most trivial sense that each inquirer is an embodied human being, living in a particular time and place, speaking (and perhaps thinking) within a given language, inquiring within a particular social setting. These trivia are not very interesting yet. But they are only the beginning.  

What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222. He specifies that the content of the tradition is self-reflexive: "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition."] deriving from a source text and continuing across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Tanakh) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Tanakh and later commentaries. Augustinianism is a tradition rooted in the Holy Bible and Augustine's corpus, consisting in socially-embedded arguments over how to best interpret and apply Augustine; history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to define history, how to conduct historical enquiry. 

With all this said, MacIntyre assumes that "we" inhabit a tradition. Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism does not correlate to the contemporary political division between “conservatives” and “liberals.” Rather, liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives”.) For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

In the (1990) Gifford Lectures, MacIntyre presented three rival versions of moral inquiry as expressions of three rival traditions.[@macintyre1990three] A book was later made of these lectures. Richard Forty wrote that the book “deepens and defends MacIntyre’s claim that genuinely rational enquiry requires membership in a particular type of moral community. He offers the most persuasive recent restatement of the Thomist position on the relation of metaphysics to morality.” What are the “three rival versions”? He labels them ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and ‘tradition’. Now, the use of the single word ‘tradition’ to mean both the genus (with three species) *and* one of those three species is deadly confusing, so I propose to call the third tradition Thomism. 

The three are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. Genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Thomists use the past as a basis for building upon and yet transcending the past. 

&gt;The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, Genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.[@lutz2015]

Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think “we have arrived.” Thomists think, in advance, that those in the future will use the present as a foundation for building upon and yet transcending the present. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, though Foucault and Derrida get honorable mention. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica* and to Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. As for the *Britannica*, one reviewer put the point this way: 

&gt;The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms." 

For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. I was educated in a modern university on modern fare, as were my readers (I presume). So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. It has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Within modernity, we analytic philosophers have further source texts in Russell, Frege, and Wittgenstein, instigating arguments over how to best conduct philosophical enquiry, the definition of analytic philosophy, and the relationship between language and thought. These arguments take place almost exclusively in a university setting, through academic books, conferences, lectures, seminars, and journal publications rather than (as in other times) through newspapers, popular books, parliamentary debates, and so on. 

The difference between 'tradition' and neighbor concepts, such as culture, theory, institution, inquiry, and practice will, I hope, become clearer below. And a few objections to MacIntyre's allegedly vague definition will be discussed below. The reader is not yet expected to agree with such a characterization of tradition. It is sufficient, at this juncture, to grasp the point and to grant it as an axiom for what follows. 

### MacIntyre's intellectual history ###

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a living moral tradition, the Aristotelian tradition. Before I presented his account of virtue, I needed to supply at least a makeshift account of tradition. There is one other account I need to give. Even with a notion of ourselves as embodied members of a living tradition of Enlightenment modernity in hand, it would be an injustice to MacIntyre's way of presenting his theory as the fruit of his own philosophical enquiry if I did not briefly tell the story of that enquiry. 

MacIntyre's intellectual history is a story of several intellectual crises. Each crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover not just a more adequate answer to the particular intellectual problem but to reflect on methodology. 

He grew up in a "border" culture between rustic Scottish fishing villages and the elite intellectual life offered him at the independent Epsom College and by his tutor R. G. Collinwood. During his undergraduate study of the classics at Queen Mary College of the University of London, he acquired an interest in ethics. He pursued an M.A. At the University of Manchester and wrote his thesis ("*The Significance of Moral Judgments*") critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. 

From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] Many who critique the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity end up with "the masters of suspicion" who distrust thought, language, and rationality itself. MacIntyre took a surprising course. The kinds of critical analysis the "masters of suspicion" use did level to the ground much of the edifice of modernity. But rather than embracing a thorough, cynical, postmodernism of this sort, MacIntyre took to an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue, and eventually Thomism, that MacIntyre continues to build. 

One of MacIntyre's most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive. He invitation is this: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

Now, MacIntyre's image is not merely about morality as one sub-field within academic philosophy. It is about morality as part of the fabric of social and political life, part of what binds groups together, gives urgency and meaning to their joint projects, sustains consensus about civil laws by which honors and goods are distributed and criminal punishments are delivered. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any applied ethical issue you can think of such as the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation and so on. They also disagree about the background issue in resolving practical moral problems -- that is, which normative framework to use, deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism, quietism, ironic nihilism or something else entirely. Modern ethicists have sometimes taken comfort in the retreat to meta-ethics. Perhaps stepping back from sticky normative questions will permit the calm, cool, and rational resolution of some problems in moral semantics, moral metaphysics, and moral epistemology. Yet after a century of metaethics, the field has not consolidated but proliferated moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreement on the formal and material propositions under dispute. It seems that deep and abiding disagreement within normative ethics and metaethics is the defining datum of modern moral philosophy. This is the "catastrophe" MacIntyre pictures above.

Rather than despair, MacIntyre observed an analogy between morality and science that proved extremely fruitful. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences.[@kuhn1975structure] What if a similar structure obtained in revolution between paradigms or traditions in the "moral sciences"? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. Briefly, as I read it, Kuhn's work directly confronts the widespread and naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquiry has been growing in slow and steady straight line since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. But some stagnate. A paradigm is a research program that unites many researchers with a methodology and unites their conclusions within a stable scientific system of doctrine. The encyclopedia of knowledge can be augmented or pruned, but its taxonomy stays mostly the same. A paradigm comes in for trouble when lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. If not resolved, these worries bloom into a full-blown epistemological crisis. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm becomes entrenched in the establishment. Once young, rebellious, and revolutionary, it becomes middle-aged, stable, and respectable. It is the scientific paradigm of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm. 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful." He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyerabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] The parallel between the two explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. MacIntyre’s ethical theory is both extremely cognizant of historical background and extremely cognizant of methodology; some have thought his ethics (of the good) collapses into epistemology (a means of rationally identifying the good). The thought is a mistake, but an understandable one. An understandable mistake that also happens in the philosophy of science. 

This comparison between *ethical* crises and *scientific* crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. 

MacIntyre's ethical philosophy began in crisis and despair, but did not end there. It ended, rather, in a thoroughgoing Thomism that is at once historicist and progressive, at once optimistic and anti-relativistic. Making sense of such a conclusion is not easy. But it is much easier if we are clear about where his radical critic of the modern tradition arises from, and how he aims to solve it. 

## Virtue, Practice, Tradition

I can now present MacIntyre's account of virtue.  His virtue theory is not fully supplemented until he completes the“*After Virtue* Project” consisting of *After Virtue* (1984), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988); *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990); and *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999). But the most focused presentation is *After Virtue*. We will begin there. 

In this section, I will reflect in detail on his initial definition, which he derives from a careful study of the traditions of virtue from Homer, Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragic poets, the New Testament, Aquinas, Jane Austen, and Benjamin Franklin. Then I will summarize how he expands this definition with supporting concepts such as the self (which is the bearer of individual virtue), practice (which is an activity in which virtues are needed), practical reason (which is our human nature). 

Each of these interlocking concepts build on and also support his conception of virtue. If these concepts as presented are accurate to the phenomena of human life, then each one lends support to MacIntyre’s conviction that “humans need the virtues.” 

### Virtue — a first pass

MacIntyre’s philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’ within *After Virtue*. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and concludes with his own His account is historical but not historicist; it aims for universality but is not purely abstract conceptual analysis. It is, in a word, traditional. MacIntyre’s definition emerges from history but is not restricted to its history; he does not vow to conserve. Yet it does not appear “out of heaven”, unprecedented, unpredicted, unaccountable, and ready-made. 
His first definition, as mentioned above, is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191] A few initial comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are acquired *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre later changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are *acquired* human qualities. In the first line of Plato's *Meno*, Meno asks Socrates a question that moral philosophers have continued to try to answer for the last 2,400 years. He asks "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is *acquired.* This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. In this, he agrees with Aristotle that virtue is *in accordance with* nature but not *by nature*. That is, we might say, virtues do not arise "automatically" but also are not acquired by working against the grain of our human nature. Rather, they can be seen as a "normal" psychological outgrowth of cultivating certain human practices. 

Thirdly, virtues enable their possessor to achieve particular *goods.* There are two implicit points here. Virtues by definition are beneficial. A virtuous trait *cannot* be directed at achieving ills. This point solves by definitional fiat a very vexing question that recurs often in ethical philosophy, namely, can overall vicious and wicked people have particular virtues? Can the thief be courageous, the dictator magnanimous, the glutton affable? It certainly seems that the answer is yes. I shall discuss this point a bit more under the objection of relativism. 

A second implicit point is that virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally.  A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both instrumental (to the achievement of certain goods) and also *partly constitutive of those goods.* Virtues are both means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

This worry exposes deep fault lines. For the sake of completing my presentation of virtue, I must set it aside for now. I shall return to it under the heading of the objection about teleology.  

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference goods internal to *practices*. Practice is a key term of art within MacIntyre's theory of virtue. To misunderstand 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So with these initial comments in hand, I shall more deeply explore MacIntyre's unfolding account of virtue in the following sub-sections. Each section will elaborate on one of the following key components: practice, self, and tradition. 

### Practice ###

What is a practice? A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends. Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, and political activity as examples *inter alia*. A practice is not merely a reflexive action (like scratching an itch) nor merely a single, discrete, intelligible action (like pulling a weed); it is an intelligible set of actions such as tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc., all embedded within a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is a social activity undertaken (let's say) for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

Leading MacIntyre scholar, Christopher Lutz, analyzes MacIntyre’s famous passage into the following four statements. A practice is: 

&gt;[1] a complex social activity that [2] enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. [3] Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, [3] the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.[@lutz2015] 

As this explication makes more clear, MacIntyre’s notion of virtue and practice is tied to the goods “internal to” practices. He later calls internal goods "goods of excellence" and calls external ones "goods of effectiveness.” The point here is, I think, clear. The goods internal to farming are just those that *necessarily constitute success within a given practice as it is*: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers aim to produce comestibles, but I am generalizing.) Virtues relative to the practice of farming might include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Mere efficiency in attaining such external goods does not entail the presence of a virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just a neutral desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

An illustrative example is political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the *polis*. But others (we need not speculate the proportion!) engage in order to achieve “external”, unessential, goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power. Very often we see American politicians running for office with apparently only one aim: book sales. 

As I see it, virtue defined by practice can already be significantly contrasted against mere *happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. On the one hand, the standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal formal laws. They are “contentful,” immanent, flexible standards. On the other hand, the standards by which practitioners judge each other are not all “external” ; they are not merely an arbitrary set of social conventions. Farmers cannot get together and decide farming is no longer about husbandry but is about selling land along highways for billboard advertisements. The practice itself, with its history and its aims, has a structure that is persists across generations and flexes, but does not break, with varying standards. That structure is passed along, modified, but modified according to an inner logic. Many have agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe’s characterization of consequentialism more generally that it views all consequences as “external.” She puts the point in this way: 

&gt;Now the consequentialist has no footing on which to say "This would be permissible, this not"; because by his own hypothesis, it is the consequences that are to decide, and he has no business to pretend that he can lay it down what possible twists a man could give doing this or that; the most he can say is: a man must not bring about this or that; he has no right to say he will, in an actual case, bring about such-and-such unless he does so-and-so.[@anscombe1958 13] 

I shall return to this discussion of external goods below in the teleological objection. 

The internal goal of farming is (by my hypothesis) the production of edible food; its practitioners *as farmers* are committed to this goal without any eye toward broader features of farming as a business. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. By contrast, the practice of farming demands specific virtues. A farmer must be honest in order to maintain positive relationships with various suppliers and buyers; a farmer must be courageous, willing to withstand real pain and risk possible harm for the sake of the good being pursued, in order to face unseasonable weather, illness, or other misfortune. 

### Self ###

MacIntyre's account of virtue begins in terms of practices. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. A second layer of his account in *After Virtue* defines virtues as beneficial *to* human beings, human selves.[@macintyre1984after chapter 15.] Humans perform practices; humans are the bearers of virtues and vices. What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. Drawing the contrast between MacIntyre’s view and the modern puts into clear relief the differing conceptions of the good, of nature, and of *telos*. 

The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast well enough to quote them in full:

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a *telos*, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific *telos* brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a *telos* external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. Indeed, they celebrate the empty self. The elimination of these strictures seem an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

It is difficult to understate the importance of this point about the self and its relation to not only virtue theory but ethical theory itself. Edward Oakes describes the removal of *telos* from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”

&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed.
&gt;This is perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy. Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of *telos*, restored to its proper place. In the modernist picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. My present self is a time slice of my overall total self (through time), I am able to know facts and value values, I have my own good separate and apart from your good and that of my family and community and society. In the traditional picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. In the present, I owe my being and personhood to the past (especially my family who biologically gave me being) and psychologically and culturally to my tradition. I am able to know truth, for there is only one manifold of truths. My good is that of my community; my community’s good is that of mine. These data are fundamental. 

On this issue, MacIntyre argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self.  While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a few comments are worth making to clarify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map.

Two considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

By contrast, it seems that each of us takes an identity, at least in part, from our past and from our tradition. 

### *Telos* and happiness ### 

For MacIntyre, the loss of *telos* (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But *telos* unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear *telos* is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

In the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”, the *Nicomachean Ethics*, MacIntyre finds the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific *telos*. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that *telos*.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The *telos* of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 

His provisional conception of our human *telos* is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human *telos* is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single *telos* governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of *telos*). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and *telos* comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a *telos*, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our *telos*. 

MacIntyre says: 

&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of *telos* as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their *telos*, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not a eudaimonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaimonist. He seems to be saying that our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human *telos* (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the *telos* might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate *telos* of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. 

I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

Thus far, we have seen that MacIntyre presents virtues as those qualities acquired by individual selves in the performance of practices that serve the intrinsic teloi or ends of those practices. 


### An initial worry 

One worry that many readers have shared is that MacIntyre’s account of virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a “practice”? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. MacIntyre vehemently denies being a relativist and devotes the whole of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* to capturing the truth in *relativity* while escaping relativism.

He admits that there *might* be evil practices. (We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil.) If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. MacIntyre's earlier theory cannot overcome this objection, Lutz argues. He says:

&gt;Unfortunately, the relativism of *After Virtue* cannot be overcome unless its definitions of the virtues are extended to embrace the Aristotelian and Thomistic doctrine of the unity of virtue. Macs rejection of the unity of virtue in *After Virtue* has grave implications for the rest of his virtue theory because the rejection of the unity of virtue divroces the intellectual moral virtue of prudence from the passional moral virtues of courage, temperence, and justice... Prudence becomes cleverness. Courage and temperance are relativized, so that one could reasonable speak of the virtue of courage in a Nazi... Likewise, justice is reduced to some notion of fairness.[@lutz2004tradition 98]

There have been ethical philosophers who endorse this kind of reductive virtue. Lutz mentions Edmund Pincoff as an "emotivist virtue theorist" (using "emotivist" in the narrower, MacIntyrean sense). Lutz continues by examining the implications of such a theory. Such a move has two main effects: (1) "It constitues the rejection of the Aristotelian practical syllogism that MacIntyre wanted to recover in *After Virtue* because it separates prudent reasoning from virtuous action. (2) It evacuates all falsifiable substantive moral content from the virtues, reducing them to enabling qualities."[@lutz2004tradition 100] The commonsense definition of "virtue" includes positive valence. A virtue is, within our tradition, a quality *admirable for its own sake* or else a quality that enables its bearer to *achieve admirable goals*. If a procedure results in a definition of virtue wherein even bad qualities or even good qualities that enable any given wicked goal, then the procedure has gone awry. 

To avoid relativism, he must say something to do justice to the assumption that virtues are not neutral with respect to ends, but are actually *good* for their possessor. He must put practice into a broader teleological context and question whether life *as a whole* can be virtuous. He does say that the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] Integrity is not our *telos*, but it is a necessary condition. Even putting human life into a unified, narrative context does not ultimately solve the problem of relativism. For we still might worry: is there a single *telos* for human life? Is there a unity to all the virtues such that “wicked virtues” can be excluded? And if so, is it rooted in our “metaphysical biology” as Aristotle thought? 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third layer in the *After Virtue* account. His answer to this worry is, I believe, the crux of his whole theory of ethics. It appeals to two concepts that are, for him, intimately bound up with each other. The two concepts are practical reason and human nature. (In the next section, I shall show how practical rationality and tradition meld into one concept.) I shall discuss each in turn and attempt to show how they are unified in MacIntyre’s thought. 

### We are practical reasoners ###

I would like to add details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to *Whose Justice?* The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally significant as our independence, autonomy, or self-sufficiency. In other words, there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate the commonalities between us and other animals. He says: 

&gt;“I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

The point, I take it, is that we are practical reasoners. Imagine any scenario of humans gathering and doing what comes naturally, and it will involve group deliberation about what to do: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

This is the first point. The second is that our lives are not lived out as adults, but progress from young, to middle aged, to old. Regarding point (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says:  

&gt;“Virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities that are specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how and why they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9] 

How do the arguments of *After Virtue* connect to these points? We may fairly draw this connection: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and the virtues that enable them must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

Whatever definition of virtue we settle on will generate a “list” of virtues. Whatever virtues are included on the list had better not exclude virtues that make human life possible; it had better not exclude (as Aristotle did) women and manual workers from the very possibility of developing virtues. 

We can see how the structural limits on what it means to be human begin to set boundaries on our ethical theories. Empirical study cannot tell us what is good, but it can set limits on *what is not* going to be good for creatures like us. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] But our practical reasoning sets us apart in some respects. We have the burden and responsibility to set the course for our own lives, and to care for the dependent among us who are not yet practical reasoners or who are no longer such. 

The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. This makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. Vices harm the dependent and restrict them from becoming independent practical reasoners. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. Weinstein says that the primary theme of his work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre %%page number%%] In this he defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but simply is the domain of *living well*.  *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

Our human nature as dependent practical reasoners also clarifies why prudence or *phronesis* is the master virtue. It complements and completes every other moral virtue. MacIntyre defends Aristotle’s conception of the practical syllogism wherein the major premise is an evaluative judgment about a virtue or action-type; the minor premise is a truth judgment about a situation or action-token; the conclusion is *an action*. For example, “I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting a student’s attempt to bribe me for a higher grade. This student is attempting to bribe me for a higher grade. Therefore, in this case, I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting this student’s attempt to bribe me.” Without moral virtues, prudence is simply the knowledge of *what is to be done*. Without prudence, the moral virtues are simply skills or habits that might be serviceable to bad ends; one might be excellent in achieving *what is not be done*. 

The mastery of prudence over other virtues also unifies the other virtues. *Dependent Rational Animals* advances MacIntyre’s virtue theory in that it supplies a basis for the unity of intellectual and moral virtues, for the unity of the various moral virtues, and for unity of the various stages of the narrative of *human* life. The paradoxical notion of “wicked virtues” are explained only with this broad context of human life, and with this definition of human nature. As Christopher Lutz says, “The strength of MacIntyre's account of practices is that the pursuit of excellence in a practice entails the pursuit of virtue, but if practices can be evil, and virtues can "enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to” such an evil practice, and virtues can be anything at all.[@lutz2004tradition 101]

Although these responses to the initial worry about relativism may bring up more questions than they answer, they at least present a coherent picture of human life and the qualities needed to live it well. 

### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

For MacIntyre, moral enquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such enquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. 


## Objections 

MacIntyre’s work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

In the following sub-sections, I group his three types of critics. Then, I articulate and discuss key objections especially from his “encyclopedist” critics. 

The primary objection regarding virtue as he defines it relative to practices, the narrative of human life, and tradition, is the charge of relativism. This is a weighty objection and deserves almost a whole chapter in its own right. 

A related objection regarding tradition-constituted rationality charges MacIntyre with an incoherent definition of tradition; if some traditions are truly incommensurable to each other, and MacIntyre himself is truly situated within a tradition, then writing a book like *After Virtue* which is written from a universal, objective, view-from-nowhere should be impossible. Writing *After Virtue* and defending a theory of virtue amounts to a performative contradiction. 

The third objection regarding teleology and the “quest” for human happiness or fulfillment is twofold: on the one hand, it seems that modern moral philosophy can get along quite well without teleology. On the other hand, even if it couldn’t, then that seems to indict philosophical ethics entirely as unscientific, hopeless, superstition. 

I summarize the secondary literature on these points, as well as MacIntyre’s replies, and attempt to adjudicate the conflict. Finally, I shall close with a reflection on why his philosophical ethics is so liable to misunderstanding and, to some, so infuriating. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


### Three types of critic

I think it also helpful to group the *types* of critic before stating the *critiques*. The three rival versions of moral enquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. His first group of critics are “traditionalists”,  fellow Thomists or others within the broader Aristotelian tradition. For instance, Robert P. George and John Haldane ostensibly share but also dispute his Thomism. (Since I am not a Thomist and do not have a dog in that fight, I shall not dig deeply into these worries.)

A second group of postmodern philosophers are “genealogists.” Such readers agree with his critique of modernity but reject his solution. They agree that our choice is between “Nietzsche or Aristotle” but choose Nietzsche over Aristotle. Some encyclopedists have even argued (as a critique) that MacIntyre’s philosophy leads to Nietzscheanism. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

But I think to concede this is to give up on ethics as philosophy -- and perhaps to give up on philosophy as a whole. If it were true, I would have to stop writing now. 

The third group of critics are modern philosophers that are (by MacIntyre’s lights) “encyclopedists.” They belong to the tradition of modernity. Such readers (including Martha Nussbaum and Thomas Nagel) find MacIntyre’s diagnosis misguided and so find his solutions needless and radical. In their critiques, they object to the historical grouping of all “modern moral philosophies” together and to the quite despairing treatment of them. They deny that our choice is *either* “Nietzsche or Aristotle.  They defend some form of modern moral philosophy against the debunking arguments MacIntyre somewhat shares with postmodern philosophers. Their biggest worry is relativism about rationality, both theoretical and moral. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, non-perspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality.  Although MacIntyre is a successful analytic philosopher, most of his influence has not come from within analytic ethics. (I treat 'success' as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) I think his fellows have been tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy.[@hauerwas2007 put it this way: A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."] Some have suggested that his theory amounts to an abandonment of philosophy in favor of religion. For now, I would caution against this interpretation. Instead, for those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to reflect upon one’s own tradition, and to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are historically extended arguments.

### Relativism objections

The most recurring objection to MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy is a cluster of worries about relativism. How do we make sense of this objection? We have to stipulate what relativism is. The constellation of (sometimes conflicting) positions that fly under heading of 'relativism' is no small task. Instead of attempting to sift them, I shall follow Stephn Lutz: “Relativism” is a thesis about the conclusion of enquiries; every would-be knower wants truth, but is limited by its contingent, historical conditions and/or the perspective of the enquirer. Hence no conclusion is *true* in the sense the enquirer wanted.[@lutz2004tradition 66] To the relativist, the knower's individual or cultural perspective is both starting point and ending point of any enquiry. 

In MacIntyre's terms, virtue, it seems, is relative to practices, to communities, to institutions, or to rival traditions of moral enquiry. Acceptance of a tradition entails acceptance of *a* particular definition of virtue and list of virtues; denial of a tradition (or denial of *tradition itself*) entails the rejection of any definition of virtue and list of virtues. He maintains that it is possible and common for traditions to be incommensurable with each other. So conceptions of virtue can be incommensurable with each other. In light of this interpretation of his ethical theory, all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that tradition consider to be virtues, not what virtues *actually are*. The inquirer interested in, say, which tradition is *correct* or which version of moral enquiry is *correct* is at a loss. 

Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] Of these, three are simply misunderstandings, three legitimate calls for clarification, and three put real pressure on the limits of MacIntyre’s theory. Whether the pressures ultimately amounts to an objection depends on whether the limits of the theory correspond to the *the actual limits* on enquiry. While I cannot summarize all nine of these objections, in the next section I shall discuss five of those I take to be most cutting. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality objections ###

The set of relativism objections pushes MacIntyre (and us) to articulate more clearly the supporting theory of practical rationality. For MacIntyre, ethical reasoning *just is* practical reasoning; practical reasoning is a mode of *reasoning* per se. "The significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Moral judgments help us "appraise and plan" action. This move does not erase a worry relativistic morality; it passes the buck to relativistic rationality. The apparent incommensurability of moralities -- including varying conceptions of virtue -- passes the buck to varying conceptions of rationality. For this reason, Stephen Lutz' last objection pertaining to relativism I categorize as an objection pertaining “tradition-constituted rationality.” The objection is threefold: is MacIntyre’s concept of tradition-constituted rationality even coherent? If so, is it clear enough to be an indispensable feature of an ethical theory? If so, then how can MacIntyre avoid the charge of relativism at this level? 

Here is a reason to think his tradition-constituted theory of rationality is incoherent. Varying traditions can disagree about a proposition P. Perhaps tradition A finds P true and B finds it false, on best evidence and sufficient reflection. But incommensurable traditions disagree about the standards (say, S1 and S2) by which to judge the truth and even the rationality of other traditions. So A finds P true and rational (by S1) while B finds P false and irrational (by S2). They genuinely disagree. And A judges B to be irrational (since they deny that P) while B returns the favor (since A affirms that P). 

According to MacIntyre's account of how members of a tradition undergo epistemological crisis and begin to examine the resources of rival traditions, we tell a little story of Annabelle. Annabelle is member of tradition A discovers problems with her own tradition. Let's imagine that P entails both (Q and ~Q). She cannot deny P nor can she affirm the contradiction. (Suppose that by A's standards of rationality, S1 contradictory propositions cannot both be true in the same sense.) After some searching about, she concludes she cannot solve the problem and cannot even discover the rational resources with which to solve them. Being passingly familiar with tradition B, she becomes curious why her friends who belong to that tradition deny P and exercises her philosophical imagination to begin to see B "from within." Tradition B is compelling, since it denies that P. She "converts" traditions. However, there is a problem with tradition B, and that is that the standard of rationality of B (S2) allows its adherents to affirm a contradiction. So now, even though Annabelle left A to avoid having to affirm a contradiction (by her standard of rationality S1) now that she has joined B she no longer sees it as irrational to affirm the contradiction (by her new standard of rationality S2). This is surely an odd conclusion. 

A second variation on the same problem is this: how would a born-and-raised member of tradition B, affirming S2, ever come to epistemological crisis? Discontentment with contradictions is not available to B members *ex hypothesi*. They do not see affirming a contradiction as irrational. Their tradition can bear a hundred instances of (Q and ~Q).

The odd conclusion of this thought experiment is a dilemma: either such nonsense is possible, or embracing the law of non-contradiction is a universal standard of rationality in every tradition. The latter option seems to indicate that traditions A and B are *not* actually incommensurable, since they share one rather substantial presupposition. The flow of members from one to the other is intelligible. The former option allows A and B to be incommensurable, but seems to freeze members in their own tradition. Members of A would have no (rational) justification for joining B, while members of B would have no (rational) justification for leaving B. 

### *Telos* objections###

The third and final major objection I shall consider pertains to teleology. I hope my summary above was adequate to demonstrate MacIntyre's case for rejecting the modern encyclopedist tradition and for returning, instead, to the Aristotelian tradition is predicated on the importance of retaining *telos* and the disastrous consequences of excising *telos* from our understanding of ourselves, our practices, our lives, and our traditions. 

This constellation of objections is so powerful -- and the prejudices and misconceptions surrounding teleology are so thick --  I shall need more than the sections in this chapter to fully respond to it. I think an adequate response can, ultimately, be made. But philosophers' opposition to some forms of teleology is visceral opposition. It will take some philosophical digging around in the structural foundations of our thinking to make progress.  

Notwithstanding the general difficulty of this objection, in this chapter I shall present two initial forms that are especially problematic for MacIntyre's narrative. MacIntyre has it that modern moral philosophy surgically excised *telos* from natural science, psychology, and ethics. So the first form is this objection is to deny that narrative. 

Perhaps modern moral philosophy is not so anti-teleological as all that. Kant's categorical imperative, much vaunted for its austere duty for the sake of duty, is actually aimed at perfection.[@ward1971kant] Keith Ward argued with some impatience almost 40 years ago (10 years before *After Virtue*'s first edition) that Kant should not be interpreted as commending duty as some abstract, context-free obligation. He says: 

&gt;Kant's position is not merely that one must conceive oneself as setting up a purposive order of Nature, according to universal laws, as though one could arbitrarily choose anything whatsoever as one's purpose. One can see this if one takes Kant's list of examples of moral duties in the *Metaphysic of Morals* [sic]. Masturbation is against the *purposes of Nature*, in forming the sexual organs; suicide contravenes *Nature's purpose* in establishing self-love in order to preserve life... Finally, "holiness of will" must be pursued, as this expresses the absolute worth of the human person, in its freedom from sensuous impulses and its transcendence of Nature.[@ward1971kant 341] 

A second iteration of the same objection in its first form is that it seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of *telos*. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). So perhaps virtue ethics can be synthesized with consequentialism. 

Furthermore, Cummiskey has argued that Kant can be understood as a consequentialist of sorts.[@cummiskey1996kantian] The proposal is that Kant's *justification* for moral normative principles was a brute, formal, categorical imperative, but the *content* of such normative principles included agents and the goods they aim to attain. Happiness can be valued as an imperfect duty, though rational agency must be valued as a perfect duty. Without entering into all the interesting details at this juncture, the thought is that perhaps a (thoroughly modern) moral philosophy like deontology can be synthesized with natural teleology. 

A second form of this objection about teleology is that ethics can get along well enough without intrinsic *teloi*. The moral law *by itself* guides or forms our actions without a natural *telos* performing that function. For example, Christine Korsgaard's "Authority of Reflection"[@korsgaard1996authority] builds a case that human autonomy -- the ability to be a law to oneself -- is the source of normative authority. How does this work? My own identity as a human being obligates me to behave morally. She argues that "autonomy is the source of obligation" and that "we have *moral* obligations... to humanity as such."[@korsgaard1996authority 93] Because I am self-reflective, I am accountable for what I do. Also because I am self-reflective, I have a self-conception. She says the "thinking self" regulates the "acting self." Korsgaard's notion of practical identity is that we assume identities such as human being, child, parent, teacher, etc. Each identity is functional; it grounds obligations. If I am really to be a teacher, I must show up for class. If I really am to be a parent, I must feed and educate my child. Practical identities may be more or less contingent. All of us are children; not all of us educators. At least one practical identity is necessary. That is our practical identity *as humans*. Humans "need to have practical conceptions of our identity in order to act and live."[@korsgaard1996authority 106] The fact is, we do act and live. Therefore we do have a moral identity. Put another way, she says: “Rational action is possible only if human beings find their own humanity to be valuable.”[@korsgaard1996authority 106] The moral identity is one in which I take up a viewpoint as a member of the "Kingdom of Ends", the community of those who also have a moral identity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 

The point of these objections is to push back on MacIntyre's narrative in which our modern liberal tradition excised *telos*. Either we did not do so, or (even if we did) we could get along without it. 

These three objections -- from relativism, about the concept of tradition, and about teleology -- are some of the most telling against MacIntyre's theory. In the next section I shall attempt a rebuttal of each one. I shall close with a discussion of MacIntyre's influence and why, I think, his theories are so polarizing.

## Discussion

Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted at being considered a giant in Lilliput but a midget in Brobdingnag;[@swift1965gulliver Part I, chapter 2 and Part II, chapter 1] the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is pejoratively called a rationalist by the fideist and a fideist by the rationalists; he is called a progressive by traditionalists and a traditionalist by progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. To quote Swift: "Philosophers are in the right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise than by Comparison."

In order to address the three major objections above, I need to do a bit more work to clear away misunderstandings. To this end, I shall briefly summarize Lutz' discussion of six misguided criticisms before addressing more robust objections pertaining to relativism, tradition-constituted rationality, and teleology below. 

#### Feldmen ####

The first, that of of Susan Feldman[@feldman1986objectivity] misinterprets MacIntyre’s project as a failed and incoherent attempt to resolve factious, subjective ethical disputes by judging them from an abstract, objective, ideal observer. But MacIntyre never explicitly presents his theory as an ideal observer theory; rather, he explicitly denies it. The ideal observer would have to *begin* the enquiry from the view from nowhere, which is impossible for us. MacIntyre just is not building -- not even *attempting* to build -- a procedural meta-ethics with which to adjudicate otherwise intractable normative disagreements. 

#### Wachbroit ####

A second criticism is from Robet Wachbroit.  MacIntyre himself responded to Wachbroit in the second edition of *After Virtue*.[@wachbroit1984relativism] Wachbroit's worry is about the fundamental plurality of rationalities. He thinks MacIntyre faces a dilemma. Either MacIntyre himself writes from the view from nowhere, the Enlightenment objectivity, the archimedean point, or he writes from within the Aristotelian tradition. MacIntyre seems to get caught in this dilemma in sentences like these: "It scarcely needs repeating that it is the central thesis of *After Virtue* that the Aristotelian moral tradition is the best example we possess of a tradition whose adherents are entitled to a high measure of confidence in its epistemological and moral resources."[@macintyre1984after 277] To whom does that 'we' refer? The dilemma, again, is that either 'we' are the Enlightened modern liberals or 'we' are the dyed-in-the-wool Aristotelians. On the first horn, if he writes from the view-from-nowhere, then MacIntyre is simply a modern meta-ethicist writing modern meta-ethics. He is criticizing liberalism from within the liberal tradition; he is borrowing the resources of the liberal definition of rationality to posit a theory in which no one definition of rationality has the resources to write books like *After Virtue*. On the second horn, if 'we' are card-carrying Aristotelians, it is trivial and almost tautologous to assert that 'we' take a high measure of confidence in Aristotelianism's epistemological and moral resources. Of course 'we' do! That kind of heady confidence that 'we' are up to standards arises within *each* tradition according to *that* tradition's own standards. 

Wachbroit misunderstands MacIntyre's theory ever so slightly here. MacIntyre can run through the horns of the dilemma. The 'we' need not be an ideal observer from a God's-eye point of view nor an Aristotelian already subsumed in the Aristotelian tradition. The 'we' can be those of us within broader western culture who have faced or might face the same kind of epistemological crisis that lead MacIntyre (and others) to critically evaluate the present state of western culture. The adherent of liberalism and the adherent of Aristotelianism share a common social, historical, and traditional root. Without too much difficulty, they can learn each other's conceptual vocabulary as a 'second language'. By self-reflecting upon the Enlightenment "branch" of the broader western tradition, and by facing up to its inadequacies and epistemological inconsistencies, the liberal adherent can test for him or herself whether the Aristotelian tradition has more resources for solving problems that are problems *by liberalism's own lights*. If, as MacIntyre did, such a person discovers that the Aristotelian has more resources for solving those problems, he or she might make rejoin with that older but no less thriving tradition. 

#### Colby Objection ####

Mark Colby misunderstands MacIntyre's project as an attempt to develop a new, objective criterion of truth that will solve the problem of epistemological crisis, regardless of one's tradition. On Colby's reading, MacIntyre is a kind of pragmatist, where the truth is just the conclusion of a certain sort of rational enquiry. But MacIntyre denies this. The test of a traditon's rationality is its adequation to reality. Lutz illustrates this with the example of astronomy. 

&gt; Ptolemaic astronomy lasted 1000 years because it solves a set of astronomical problems better than any of its opponents, including the heliocentric models of Aristarchus and Copernicus. Nevertheless, it did not adequately characterize the true nature of planetary motion and so under close evaluation it was plagued by inefficiencies that lead its adherents into a epistemological crisis. The theory that overcame Ptolemaic astronomy did so because it solved the astronomical problems or adequately than the Ptolemaic model, and it was confirmed by its predictive capacity. The fact that Kepler's astronomical model once subsumed into Newtonian physics, could predict novel facts provided confirmation that it was not only a clever description of a puzzling phenomenon, but a more adequate characterization of its object: the true nature of planetary motion.
&gt; what counts as progressiveness in the epistemological crisis resolution is improved adequacy to truths, but it pissed him logical crises only rise *within* traditions. Ptolemaic astronomers overcame *their* epistemological crisis when they abandoned *their own* geocentric beliefs Intertraditional considerations arise only when the adherents of one tradition are able to recongize in the resources of another tradition a more adequate solution to their own epistemological crisis. So progressiveness in epistemological crisis resolution cannot function as an intertraditional norm of rationality. This is no challenge to MacIntyre, however, because MacIntyre does not envision epistemological crisis as a tool for comparative ethics or meta-ethics.[@lutz2004tradition 91]

As I understand Lutz' point here, Colby is conflating the attempt of an inquirer *within* a tradition to resolve his or her epistemological crisis through examining the resources of a rival tradition with the attempt of an inquirier *outside* both traditions to resolve "epistemological crisis" per se by developing an intertraditional or trans-traditional criterion of adequacy. MacIntyre thinks the former is possible (and happens often) but that the latter is impossible. 

#### Roque Objection ####

Alicia Juarrero Roque surfaces another possible misinterpretation. MacIntyre claims that "comparison" between traditions is possible for an inquirer. But it is not possible by the attainment of an objective, context-free stance. Rather, each inquirier acquires a conceptual framework from his own tradition -- this is like a "first language." But each inquirer has the capacity to learn a "second first language". We can learn another conceptual framework philosophical imagination, through taking it *as if true* even before affirming it *as true*. Why do this? Usually because the inquirer's own tradition has failed him; he sees its inadequacies, he sees its problems and contradictions, he sees that it fails to live up to its own standards. MacIntyre describes what "rare gift of empathy" that this "philosophical imagination"[ makes possible: “…understand the theses, arguments, and concepts of their rival in such a way that they are able to view themselves from such an alien standpoint and to re-characterize their own beliefs in an appropriate manner from the alien perspective."[@macintyre1988whose 167]

Roque's worry is that the capacity for learning a second first language is an innate, rational capacity that *all people share.* If so, then belief in such a capacity contradicts the definition of tradition-constituted rationality. If not, then the absence of such a capacity renders tradition comparison impossible. MacIntyre's response is flatly to deny this interpretation of his work. The "capacity" to learn another tradition as a "second first language" is a "rare gift of empathy" and in no way part of a supposed bundle of innate capacities. This rebuttal does not make such a capacity unproblematic; we still might wonder whether, for an given inquirer, that inquirer's estimation that he possesses the gift of empathy and philosophical imagination isn't just a re-statement of the trivial thought, "I think I am right."

### Reply to relativism 1 -- relative rationality, absolute truth

Even with all these clarifications made, some critics still worry that MacIntyre is ultimately espousing a relativistic theory. He denies the charge of relativism.  He disagrees with, say, Rorty's claim that "there is nothing to be said about either truth or rationality apart from descriptions of the familiar procedures of justification which a given society—ours—uses in one or another area of inquiry."[@rorty1991objectivity] 

But MacIntyre accepts -- indeed, argues for -- a certain truth within relativism. That truth is that every enquirer seeks the conclusion of the enquiry at a particular time and place, within a particular social setting, within a language, and within a tradition. Following Lutz, we can say that MacIntyre accepts “relativity”. Relativity (a term borrowed from Michael Krausz[@krausz1984relativism]) is a thesis about *the condition of enquiry.* It is not a thesis about the *conclusion of enquiry.* Lutz approves of Mark Colby's statement that "argumentative situatedness is inescapable."[@lutz2004tradition 89] However such relative situatedness is compatible with objective or absolute or mind-independent or tradition-independent *truth*. 

Returning to Rorty's claim, we can say that MacIntyre agrees that "nothing can be said about... rationality" except what is taken as rational in a given society and tradition; where he disagrees is in equating rationality with *truth.* From the historically- and socially-situated position of enquiry, a philosopher (he argues) may indeed find truth. It is impossible to achieve objective or absolute or tradition-independent *rationality* but it is possible -- indeed, it is the hope and *telos* of enquiry -- to achieve objective *truth.* This may seem a paradox. 

The primary kind of truth we seek in enquiry is "the adequation of the mind to reality." This is the understanding of truth inherent in the Aristotelian tradition. He says, “To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true."[@aristotle *Metaphysics* 1011b25]  Aquinas calls this the adequation of the intellect to the object.[@aquinas Q.16; *De Veritate* Q.1, A.1-3. "Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus." Marian David says: "The main positive argument given by advocates of the correspondence theory of truth is its obviousness. Descartes: 'I have never had any doubts about truth, because it seems a notion so transcendentally clear that nobody can be ignorant of it...the word "truth", in the strict sense, denotes the conformity of thought with its object' (1639, AT II 597). Even philosophers whose overall views may well lead one to expect otherwise tend to agree. Kant: 'The nominal definition of truth, that it is the agreement of [a cognition] with its object, is assumed as granted' (1787, B82). William James: 'Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their "agreement", as falsity means their disagreement, with "reality"'' (1907, p. 96). Indeed, The Oxford English Dictionary tells us: "Truth, n. Conformity with fact; agreement with reality'".]

However, 'truth' is ambiguous across at least two senses: a metaphysical, substantive sense and an epistemological, logical sense. (There may be a third semantic sense.) The metaphysical sense of truth is simply reality. "Truths" are beings themselves. The logical sense of truth (which MacIntyre alludes to here) is the adequation of the intellect to those beings. (Logical) "truth" is knowing the (metaphysical) truth. (The third, possibly semantic, sense of 'truth' would, naturally, be the accurate relation between the content of one's assertions and the beings about which one is making assertions. "Truth" is veridical statements about the (metaphysical) truth.)

If we understand MacIntyre to be arguing or assuming that (logical) truth is adequation of mind to reality, we can make sense of his endorsement of "relativity". Rationality is something more pragmatic than truth, something more like "warranted assertability."[@dewey1941propositions 169] That is, the theories we rationally construct are, for us, the "best theory thus far". It is no contradiction or paradox to assert that our rationality is the best thus far but that others in the future (or the past, or in rival traditions) might be *closer* to the truth. 

We may think of the matter in terms of the three rival traditions we began with. Encyclopedists take rationality and truth to be objective; geneaologists take rationality and truth to be purely subjective; traditionalists take rationality to be subjective but truth to be objective. 

Every enquiry has a beginning and end, an alpha and omega. Liberal modernity treats truth and rationality as seen from a perspective-free view from nowhere as the alpha and omega. Deconstructive postmodernity treats truth and rationality seen from a particular perspective and tradition as the alpha and, therefore, as the omega. For MacIntyre, our contingent social, cultural, and individual perspective is an alpha point of every enquiry but is not necessarily the omega point of every enquiry. The enquiry can, by drawing on the past and revising the resources of the present, hope to achieve a closer adequation to reality. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes (one iteration) of the charge of relativism. The truth can be known from within the confines of our tradition and perspective. This answer, of course, puts pressure on his definition of "tradition." We shall return to this concern below. 

### Reply to relativism 2 - unity of virtue ###

Are there evil practices? If so, it seemed that MacIntyre's theory would allow "virtues" to serve wicked ends. The rebuttal to this charge depends on the unity of virtue. 

In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, MacIntyre explicitly retracts his earlier belief that virtues exist without a unity under prudence.[@macintyre1988whose preface, p. x] The consequences of this retraction, Lutz argues, are wide-ranging and crucial to refuting the charge of relativism. If virtues are unified, then even though virtues exist only in the context of practices, "no genuine practice can be inherently evil."[@lutz2004tradition 102] Rather, practical reason can judge *apparent goods* as genuine goods. The qualities needed for achieving the spurious goods internal to that "practice" would not be virtues but only *apparent virtues*. Now, such a definition certainly seems ad hoc. But Lutz provides a persuasive illustration: eugenics. Eugenics certainly seems to bear the markings of a genuine practice. Its apparent good is the purification of the gene pool for future generations. However, genuine virtues militate *against* the achievement of that goal. For example, Lutz cites a story of a Nazi doctor who had the virtue of compassion found himself unable to pursue the program of euthanizing mentally-disabled children. Even the doctor seemed disappointed with himself, asserting that he "approve[d]" state measures with conviction" but was "too gentle for this work... Heil Hitler!"[@@poliakov1979harvest 186-7] 

We might also recall Huck Finn's internal struggle with his "conscience" in *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.[@twain2014adventures Chapter 31] Huck decides to turn Jim in to the slave owners. He writes a letter outing Jim, and feels much better after "repenting" of his theft: 

&gt;I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell...  

After vividly confronting Jim's humanity, his goodness, and their loyal friendship, he wavers. 

&gt;It was a difficult situation. I picked up the letter, and held it in my hand. I was trembling, because I knew had to make a choice between two things, and the outcome of my decision would last forever. I thought about it a minute while I held my breath. And then I said to myself: “All right, then, I’ll GO to hell"—and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

The humor of this passage arises, in large part, because of the tension between the *apparent good* of treating Jim as legal property and the *actual good* of treating Jim as an end in himself, as a free man just like any other. Huck's virtue (in this case, loyalty or friendship) *cannot* be put to use in the service of a corrupting practice like slave-trading. Just as vice subverts institutions and their worthy practices, virtue "subverts" vicious institutions and unworthy practices. Virtue marks the difference between the coward who disobeys his commanding officer's orders because the obedience would put him at risk of painful death and the courageous person who disobeys his commanding officer's order because obedience would require wrongdoing. Without prudence to discriminate between the two cases, we lack any resources by which to discriminate courage and cowardice, between a virtuous resistance and vicious resistance. 

Some might worry that the distinction between apparent goods and actual goods brings with it more problems than it solves. It is certainly a distinction that leaves many questions unanswered. My first reply is that such a distinction is inevitable and necessary in our practical reasoning. Assume for a reductio that "there is no real distinction between apparent and real goods." Then either *nothing* is "actually good" (everything that appears good is just an apparent good) or that *nothing* is "actually bad though it appears good" (everything that appears good is a real good). But I take it as axiomatic and irrefutable that some things are actually good (life, pleasure, happiness, art, stars.) And some things that appear good are not good: obeying unjust laws, eating unhealthy but delicious food, etc.  Therefore there is a real distinction between apparent and real goods. 

A second reply, however, is that the admitted indeterminacy of MacIntyre's account reflects the real indeterminacy of our moral lives. Consider two phenomena: some individuals and cultures persist in behaviors (that I believe) are wicked and unjustifiable -- slavery, child prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, or what have you. It needs to be explained, from within my tradition, how it could be that otherwise decent and normal human beings could persist in such vileness. The other phenomena is this: some individuals and cultures repent and change (what I believe are) their wicked ways. In other words, there is no magical linear moral progression from wicked to good, in history as a whole; yet, even so, some individuals cultures become more good (by my standards of goodness). How do we explain this paradoxical phenomenon? 

MacIntyre's account explains why vices sometimes persist within pseudo-practices, institutions, and traditions from generation to generation; on the other hand, it explains why practice-enabling virtues sometimes emerge to disrupt a pseudo-practice, a wicked institution, and a corrupt or at least incomplete tradition. The fact is that "many kinds of activities can be, and in fact are considered to be, practices. Some of these may conflict radically, owing to errors and insufficiences in rationlity."[@lutz2004tradition 103] Errors in rationality explain errors in traditions and hence misacriptions of the title 'virtue.' Rationality answers to truth, to the world as it is, not merely to the pragmatic reduction of truth to "dialectical success."[@lutz2004tradition 104] Hence, virtues answer to *what is really good*. They do not merely answer to "what-counts-as-good-for-us", which property is relative to each tradition. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes this iteration of the charge of relativism, while still explaining why rival traditions differ -- and sometimes radically differ -- in their evaluations and opinions. Incomplete traditions can, and do, undergo crisis. Particular persons within that tradition discover and perseverate on inadequacies within the tradition, leading to an epistemological crisis. In response, others within the same tradition may become willing to examine the resources of rival traditions and either quit their primary tradition or re-fashion it, re-make it, update it, and make real moral and intellectual progress. 

### Closing remarks on relativism

J. L. A. Garcia says this: 

&gt;MacIntyre’s rebuttal is as radical as it is ingenious. It is, in effect, to outrelativize the relativist. Rather than recoiling from relativism, as I understand his strategy, MacIntyre plunges so deeply into it, as we might say, to fall out the other side… Contrary to what he sees as the relativist’s hasty and facile assumption, MacIntyre insists that it is not necessarily (nor always) the case that everyone is so situated that there is no position whose adoption *by her* at *any* time would be rationally superiors to some particular *set* of alternatives…Now the tables are turned, and it is the relativist who appears the dogmatist, claiming to know in advance and *a priori* that no one can be so situated.[@garcia2003]

 This all appears to me correct. MacIntyre uses the genealogist’s starting points to undercut the encyclopedist — a move which implicitly approves of moral relativism. But he doesn’t stop there; he uses all the resources of intellectual history and contemporary natural and social sciences to defend some (but not all) of the beliefs and values of modernity, such as the value of democracy, the value of university education, the value of history, the belief in the possibility of scientific truth, the belief in progress — a move which seems to endorse the Enlightenment and the liberal tradition as against the genealogists. To both, his challenge is to use the best resources of the past and the best rational resources of the present to defend a particular set of conclusions *as the best thus far*, as the *closest* to the truth. To both, his challenge is to defend a conception of morality and rationality *neither* claiming that any such conceptions are impossible *nor* claiming to have *concluded* the enquiry once and for all.

MacIntyre has responded to (and he thinks refuted) the charge of relativism multiple times, in his primary works and in “responses to critics.” Yet for many, relativism stains the image of MacIntyre. Even after clarifying the obscure points of the dialectic MacIntyre does endorse, the objection can be resolved but not finally refuted. I would like to offer a suggestion as to why this is so. Rather, the resolution of the criticism can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves; hence MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the enquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the enquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that enquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the enquiry. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality 1 - incoherence? ###

MacIntyre would have us believe that 'rationality' is not a disembodied set of timeless and universal procedures of thinking. My rationality includes whatever standards of reasoning I accept, and all the other resources (facts, authorities, memories) I use to judge true and false. 

From my perspective, and my tradition, every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction. But that is just to say that if Walt Whitman or Nagarjuna denies the law (or reflectively affirms contradictory propositions) then I will necessarily judge them to be irrational.[@sepcontradiction Do I contradict myself? / Very well, then, I contradict myself. / (I am large, I contain multitudes.) (Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself”); "Everything is real and not real.
Both real and not real. / Neither real nor not real. / That is Lord Buddha's teaching. (Mūla-madhyamaka-kārikā 18:8, quoted in Garfield [1995: 102])] But I wish to go further and say that this strand of Buddhism *really is irrational*. That is, I wish to affirm that they are irrational full stop. I am not sure MacIntyre's theory allows me to affirm that. Unless I am missing something crucial here, this seems to me a limitation of the theory. 

Perhaps a qualified acceptance of MacIntyre's claim about tradition-constituted rationality is that when a tradition does not *seem* share this standard of rationality (the value of logical consistency) I should not be too quick to judge that I have really understood their meaning. Perhaps when I ask them if they affirm (S is P and S is not P) they have a slightly different concept in mind for "not" or for "and." Or perhaps they are speaking of an entity instantiating a property and not instantiating that same property at the same time but in ever so slightly different respects. Walt Whitman may be saying he contradicts himself in ever so slightly different respects in order to grasp apparently paradoxical truths that can be predicated of a transcendental modern man. Or perhaps they are denying both P and not P in favor of some other, different articulation of the predicates a given subject instantiates. In the case of any of these alternatives, the principle of charity recommends I extend my interlocutor the benefit of the doubt before concluding that the appearance of irrationality reflects real irrationality. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality 2 - Clarity of the concept

Even if MacIntyre's account is coherent, is it clear?  John Haldane (among others) questions MacIntyre’s ability coherently to identify what a tradition is. What is tradition A? How do we differentiate it from B? Are two traditions separate and hence identifiable only if they are *incommensurable*? How much difference constitutes separation? How much overlap is compatible with difference? Jewish and Christian traditions share a common origin and bear considerable overlap in authorities, scriptures, and doctrines. 

MacIntyre’s definition makes answering these questions difficult. He characterizes a tradition as “separate and unified when its members or texts have a core set of shared commitments to beliefs, when the tradition is situated in a particular context in a particular set of institutions and when the tradition has an identifiable linguistic difference when compared to other traditions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 83] But is there any universal procedure for identifying such linguistic and institutional differences? 

The right response to this call for clarification, I think, comes from Weinstein. We should not expect, by MacIntyre’s lights, that there is an automatically objective, view-from-nowhere by which we can define tradition itself. Rather, MacIntyre concludes that “the concept of a tradition, together with the criteria for its use and application, is itself one developed from within one particular tradition-based standpoint. This does not preclude its application to the very tradition within which it was developed.”[@horton1994after 295] This is liable to frustrate some readers. But the alternative (by MacIntyre’s lights) is intellectual imperialism wherein one tradition has the *real* scoop on every other tradition. MacIntyre grants that his self-definition of his own tradition arises, in part, from his criteria of that tradition. Traditions change over time. They progress (according to their own unchanging standards) toward unchanging goals or else they abandon old standards. 

I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. This may not satisfy critiques but it cordons off their objections. It pushes back, to demand that the critics self-reflect and specify their own tradition (in MacIntyre’s words) even as they demand a definition of the term ‘tradition’ (in their own words). 

### Tradition-constituted rationality 3 - can rationality justify morality? ###

MacIntyre's theory of virtue makes morality depend on rationality. This has been a common, but contentious, belief in the Aristotelian tradition. I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection. D'andrea points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels a critique against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*. 

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is this: the question “why be moral?” is never asked in the abstract. Philosophers often pose the “why be moral?” question hypothetically, as if they were skeptics of one or another sort. But such an idealized moral skeptic will not do. And a non-hypothetical, non-idealized skeptic faces a problem, on MacIntyre’s theory. 

That problem is that if they are full-fledged members of their tradition, the “why be moral?” question usually does not arise. There are two exceptions: The first when persons who succeed in sincerely asking the “why be moral?” question who are, by definition, outcasts from their own society. The emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The *polis* to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the *polis* which belongs to him. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” simply do not arise. 

In drawing the distinction between the modern "emotivist self" and the "self of the heroic age" MacIntyre says, “In heroic society there is no 'outside except that of the stranger. A man who tried to withdraw himself from his given position in heroic society would be engaged in the enterprise of trying to make himself disappear.”[@macintyre1984after 126] In one sense, MacIntyre *dissolves* this worry. His strategy is not to give the skeptical “why be moral?” question the devil’s due and solve it on its own conditions; his strategy is to undermine the conditions of asking it. 

The second exception is when moral skeptics *are* members of their own tradition but are seeing the problems within their own tradition and are troubled by a “border tradition”. This skeptic sees the resources of a rival tradition and compares such favorably with the resources of his own tradition. He is, in a word, entering epistemological crisis. And to such a skeptic, MacIntyre’s theory invites him or her to do the hard work of resolving that crisis by examining, from within the context of a primary tradition *and* a “second first” tradition, the problems at hand and the available solutions, working toward an ever greater understanding of the truth. 

For this reason, again, I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. 

### *Telos* reply 1 ###

The family of objections against teleology are, I think, most potentially disastrous for MacIntyre's theory. If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover *telos*. 

The type of teleology the Aristotelian tradition takes for granted is natural teleology, of which human or social teleology is a human instantiation. The type MacIntyre needs to make his theory work is unclear. Is MacIntyre insisting on Aristotele's point, that our teleology is a "given" as part of our biological makeup? Or is he treating teleology more narrowly? Is teleological behavior not a phenomenon of nature but only a phenemonon of human beings acting intentionally? 

MacIntyre's view is, I think, satisfying. We can sidestep a conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups (the Republican or Democratic Party, the YMCA, the U.S.A., the Parent Teacher Association, Starbucks) is end-directed actions and practices. Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. *telos* can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With *telos* firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether *telos* exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. 

The proof of social teleology is reflection on our experience. The alternative to social teleology is fully Aristotelian natural teleology rooted in the metaphysics or in biology. For Aristotle, human end-direction is a subset of the end-direction that appears in all of nature, at least all of biological nature. 

MacIntyre does not need intentionality to be a subset of natural teleology. Rather, he needs his interlocutor to admit that human action is end-directed. We act to achieve goals. Whether we arise from bed *in order to* give a talk, or drive to work *in order to* do a good job, or pursue a career *for* satisfaction and a profitable retirement, we are directing ourselves toward ends. In groups, too, we deliberate about what to do, about *what is to be done*. We pursue group goals. We are directed at group ends. Congress aims to pass just and beneficial laws. The school board aims to increase enrollment and balance the budget. The university administration builds a football stadium *to draw revenue* and to create a football program.  

Once this point is made clear, the adherent of the modern liberal tradition has two options. Either accept it and claim that type of *telos* as part of modernity; or argue that that type of *telos* is non-existent and therefore unnecessary for morality. (The genealogist, again, is free to reject that type of *telos* and therefore reject morality altogether.) I am putting aside genealogical moral skepticism and nihilism for this chapter. 

And MacIntyre's arguments that morality without *any* conception of *telos* has been adequately stated above.  MacIntyre has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without *telos* becomes an unintelligible set of rules or traditions.  Virtue without *telos* literally has no point. A society that enforces chaste behavior and honors chastity as a virtue but does so without any understanding of how such chastity fits into the fulfilled life of a fully virtuous human being and a fully virtuous community will be open to the criticism that such behaviors and virtues are prohibiting a whole range of pleasurable activities.  

In light of these considerations, we should not be surprised if modern moralities have attempted to retain intelligibility for moral rules retain some semblance of teleology. I argued above, on behalf of the objection, that Kantianism and consequentialism are teleological. MacIntyre's response would be, I believe, to concede the point. If Kant himself can be interpreted as a teleological ethicist (of a sort), so much the better for Kantian morality. 

MacIntyre's critique of "emotivist" ateleological ethics may apply only to Kantians or to some readers of Kant. But if MacIntyre's analysis of the problem with modern moral philosophy is inaccurate, his solution is still accurate. Moral rules are unintelligible without an understanding of the *internal* and necessary relation between some actions and some outcomes. Kant himself, perhaps, understood this better than many of his contemporary readers give him credit. 

Consequentialism, however, cannot be made to be "teleological" in the Aristotelian or the MacInterean sense. The reason is that Mill has defined "consequences" so as to be always contingent. For MacIntyre, consequences may be "external" or "internal." That is, consequences of an action may be non-natural or natural. For example, the oxygenation of the blood is a natural consequence of breathing. Our biological make-up determines that the act of breathing and the oxygenation of the blood an organic whole. A natural consequence of holding your breath is a build up of carbon dioxide. Winning a world record for holding your breath underwater is a non-natural consequence of holding your breath. Consequentialists either do not distinguish between the two or are explicit that there are no ends or consequences related internally or naturally with some means. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;But before proceeding to this discussion I propose, first, to deal with the third kind of ethical question—the question: What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalization. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. This good effects are, for Moore, aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships. Strangely enough, the same Moore defines the necessary relation between parts and a whole as an "organic whole" or "organic unity." But he sees no organic unity between (some) means and their ends. Some means are partially constitutive of their ends. We might say that the *means* and the *end* form in that instance an organic whole. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constitutive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species gorilla gorilla as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics. 

I said above that the refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. Charles Taylor endorses the notion that “the place accorded the virtues [is] a kind of litmus test for discriminating Aristotelian from modern ethical theory.”[@taylor 25] What could this mean? Behind the means/end distinction is a peculiarly modern assumption that formal and final causes are either not related or not *necessarily* related. There are various ways of cashing out this distinction. In biology, it is the distinction between form and function.[@huneman2006naturalising] In engineering it is the distinction between design and operation.

For consequentialism, the great intrinsic value is happiness, or pleasure. On the surface, this sounds like a kind of Aristotelian eudaimonism. But Aristotle's eudaimonia is the necessary end of all action and all practical reasoning. The proof that we pursue eudaimonia (something vague) is as robust as the proof that we pursue *anything at all*. For Mill, happiness is something too specific: pleasure, or freedom from pain. He offers precious little justification for this. All that Mill can say to the inquirer who wants to hear about *why* happiness is desirable is that people desire it.

&gt;It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?
&gt;Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfill -- to make good its claim to be believed?
&gt;The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.[@mill chapter 4, "Of what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible"]

Mill's definition of happiness cannot be that thing we all necessarily pursue whenever we act, because then moral rules (guiding us toward the happiness of the greatest number) would be unnecessary. We would all, already, pursue happiness. 

Furthermore, Mill, like Moore, sees the relation between the end (happiness) and the means (actions that bring about happiness) as statistical, contingent, and probable. There is no internal relation between some actions (such as virtues) and the proper end of human life.

In sum, the rebuttal of the “no teleology objection" is that the sort of teleology we need is defensible: social teleology. On the one hand, Kantian philosophy may be able to accommodate social teleology, and so would escape the brunt of MacIntyre's criticism. On the other hand, the rebuttal of consequentialism, is that it has not often been taken to allow for a necessary relation between some means and their ends. Virtuous action both *causes* and *partly constitutes* virtuous character. Virtuous character traits both *cause* and *partly constitute* the kind of achievement of our human *telos* that makes life worth living. 

If MacIntyre is right here, then the project of restoring *telos* should invigorate optimism. Ethics, reinvigorated with teleology, might just be able to escape some of its modern quandaries. And not only ethics. Law, political philosophy, and applied disciplines like politics itself, rhetoric and debate, social philosophy, and others disciplines are given new promise and new hope. 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


## Conclusion

### Chapter summary
MacIntyre's work is difficult to pick apart and summarize in isolation. In this chapter, I have attempted to present MacIntyre's theory of virtue and practical rationality within traditions. I began by explaining MacIntyre's unique intellectual history and his unique theory of traditions. I then presented his account of virtue as necessarily existing in the context of practices, the narrative of human life, the self, and the achievement of our as-yet-unrealized *telos*. If my summaries have captured the core of MacIntyre's contribution to virtue ethics, we can offer a few conclusions with some confidence. Virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. And each community *needs* the virtues. 

Now, different traditions offer varying accounts of virtue and "lists" of virtues. MacIntyre's career has been one of struggling with the problem of disagreement in its moral, philosophical, religious, and scientific manifestations. So I presented three families of objections to MacIntyre's virtue theory: the relativism objections, the tradition-constituted rationality objections, and the no teleology objections.  

I attempted to rebut these objections. First, I further explained how MacIntyre's theory of rationality can accommodate "relativity" as a condition of inquiry without collapsing into "relativism" as a conclusion of inquiry. Second, I further clarified the concept of tradition-constituted rationality as necessarily recursive and thus impossible to define outside of the context of a tradition. I did concede that, from within my tradition, there appear to be no legitimate traditions who embrace contradictory propositions or who deny the Law of Non-Contradiction. Third, I defended MacIntyre's use of (at least) "social teleology" as a grounding for the teleological virtue ethics. And I conceded that some modern morality (such as a version of Kantianism) might plausibly be conceived as teleological in the way that MacIntyre's theory demands. But I denied that other modern moralities (such as paradigmatic versions of consequentialism) can be conceived as teleological in the proper way since they treat the relation of means to ends as a merely contingent relation. 

I would like to close this chapter with a reflection on MacIntyre's unique style of enquiry, which is polarizing. 

### Theorist of rationality ###

MacIntyre is a theorist of rationality (and of practical rationality and hence virtue). Hence rationally to assess his theory requires thinking through our own theory of rationality. But thinking about rationality is thinking through our own thinking. The errors we make in thinking are likely to be underscored by our attempts to *think them through*. The Greek proverb is: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” If something is deeply wrong with the way we think, how can theorizing about rationality right the wrong? The Latin proverb (from a very different context) is “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” — who will guard the guards themselves? I believe the answer to the rhetorical question is no one at all can guard the guards. If water chokes us, there is nothing we can do to wash it down and clear our throat. Similarly, some of the errors MacIntyre diagnoses in thinkers who belong to the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition will be invisible to those thinkers. 

Even if MacIntyre’s diagnosis is *correct*, especially if it is correct, the readers who especially need to hear it will find the diagnosis unintelligible, even irrational. Insofar as the "patient" finds any parts of his theory intelligible, they will seem radical, disastrous in their social implications, and destructive of the very nature and purpose of education. The reason these appearances will be insuperable to MacIntyre’s patient is because the patient is, by his lights, self-deceived. He or she simply denies being part of a tradition, and hence denies having a particular (rather than universal) tradition-bound conception of rationality, and hence denies having a particular, tradition-bound conception of the good (perhaps the good is unbounded freedom to follow the moral law, or to pursue happiness,, and justice unfettered equality). Modernity is the “tradition-less tradition” and hence *must* deny tradition to be consistent with itself. 

But *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and others are directed toward the discontented liberal modern. This patient comes to MacIntyre with manifesting symptoms. MacIntyre offers one possible diagnosis, and the patient’s job is to investigate further. The patient needs philosophical imagination to even *consider* the possibility of another truth. The patient needs patience, intellectual courage, and self-reflection. The patient needs to sit in front of the proverbial mirror and mouth the words, (a) “I am part of a tradition” and (b) “my tradition might be inadequate,” and (c) “that other tradition might have the resources more adequately to address the intellectual and practical problems that I now see are insuperable to my tradition.” 
It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side just isn’t doing philosophy anymore. My only point here is that which side it is is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal philosophers that MacIntyerean-type “philosophy” just isn’t philosophy.  It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian-type philosophers that Nagalean “philosophy” just isn’t philosophy.

Great thinkers — Plato, Aquinas, Kant — have a distinguishing feature of presenting a totalizing theory that not only explains a whole host of phenomena and solves problems, but explain why critics criticize. Great thinkers present not only philosophical solutions to philosophical problems, but a definition or understanding of philosophy itself. They are always philosophers *and* metaphilosophers. 

One of the features so satisfying to adherents of Plato, Aquinas, Kant (I could have mentioned a dozen others) is that their totalizing theory puts agreement in context and puts disagreement with the theory in context. It casts critics in a particular light. This is satisfying to adherents but infuriating to critics. 

One of the signs, I believe, of MacIntyre’s greatness is just this feature. He presents not only isolated theories but a theoretical system in which critics, depending on their criticism, receive a name, a number, a category, a classification, and a designated response. Adherents, too, are accommodated. But to criticize MacIntyre is much trickier business than one might suspect at first. Critics find themselves dipping into one of many already well-poisoned wells, and falling into pre-laid traps. The critic who would escape the battery is more likely to flee rather than engage; but the critic who would escape by engaging and overcoming is liable to meet her match. Again, while this may be infuriating, it is a sign of greatness.

I find MacIntyre’s philosophical theories highly interesting. But others find them infuriating. In this section, I attempt to surface objections to a variety of MacIntyre’s positions. For an account so ambitious in scope, it is easy to nitpick errors or unclarities here and there. I shall attempt to bring to light major objections from MacIntyre’s critics. So, what objections and misunderstandings arise? 


Misunderstandings and Objections

	1.	The first objection from some is simply to deny MacIntyre’s governing assumptions. MacIntyre’s “After Virtue Project” is an extended explanation of the “moral disaster” of modernity. But where is the disaster? (Pullitzer-prize winning novelist and theologian Marilynn Robinson posed this question.) To put it lightly, some readers will be puzzled by MacIntyre’s assessment of our dire state; his assessment simply will not accord with their experience of moral disagreement. They still have hope in modern morality. To put it more bluntly: they will be bewildered. Without the explanandum the explanans is pointless, and MacIntyre’s life’s work will seem to them to be pointless. What’s all the fuss about? On this objection, rationalistic ethics just are possible. Kant and Hume and Moore et. al are not total failures. And the contemporary metaethical debates continue unabated. 
	⁃	MacIntyre’s response might be that only someone who has seen the failures of her own tradition is “in the market” for new solutions. Only the hungry eat. Nancy Murphy gives a MacIntyrean account of theism and naturalism as rival traditions. Murphy, “Naturalism and Theism as Competing Traditions” in How Successful is Naturalism Naturalism and Theism as Competing Traditions”, Gasser (ed), 2007. Perhaps the only way, she argues, to assess the strength of another tradition is to first critically assess the weaknesses of one’s own tradition. This project she undertakes. As a theist, she points out what she sees as the critical weaknesses of her own tradition. Rather than address and resolve each one, Murphy models for the metaphysical naturalist how he ought to take responsibility for the weaknesses of naturalism as well. The proponent of what MacIntyre calls “modern liberalism” in its various forms — the Kantian, the consequentialist, even the virtue ethicist — is invited to critically reflect on his or her own tradition. If, after such a self-examination, MacIntyre’s critiques still hold no interest, then it seems acceptable to let it go. But if any one discovers any inkling of vulnerability, of weakness, of dissatisfaction — if, in short, MacIntyre’s diagnosis becomes intelligible — then MacIntyre’s prognosis becomes highly interesting. 
	⁃	The second response to this flummox is this: clearly, there are different worldview. And a rival worldview is so different as to not merely appear as a rival but as “crazy.” Those of us who resonate with MacIntyre’s profound dissatisfaction with modernity find his prognoses at least interesting, if not right; plausible, if not correct. We also feel flummoxed at postmodern philosophers and masters of suspicion — Marx, Nietzsche, Fouccoult, Rorty, Leotard, Derrida — 
	2.	A second objection comes from those convinced that (what MacIntyre calls) Nietzscheanism is true. MacIntyre sets up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. On this objection, the dilemma is correct, but he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. The pursuit of knowledge through research and argumentation is the pursuit of power or proceeds by operations of power. 
	⁃	This objection I simply cannot respond to. To accept that truth is impossible to achieve is to give up on philosophy altogether. I still have faith in philosophy. So I deny that truth is impossible. 
	3.	A third objection — more of a misunderstanding — is that MacIntyre is still fundamentally a modern. Some critics interpreted “virtue” as synonymous with “dutiful” (I.e., adhering to some moral law) or morally correct. 
	⁃	Such an objection misses (or willfully ignores) MacIntyre’s account of the insufficiency of such thin moral terms. Our moral activity and moral inquiry and moral discourse are only intelligible in the context of socially-embodied traditions as well as the practices (and often institutions) that constitute those traditions. If his account is right, then it is simply impossible to abstract a meaning for the word ‘right’ from the tradition in which it appears. 


It is challenging to pick apart such a multifaceted and interlocking series of positions and to criticize them in isolation. Therefore, I invite the reader to exercise philosophical imagination with me. Let us envision a world in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are “historically extended arguments” requires philosophical imagination. Even with this vision in mind, some objections arise. 


Objections
	1.	Relativism. A very different objection arises from someone who agrees with MacIntyre that modern moral discourse is a confused and chaotic mess. This objector might agree that virtues are relative to practices, to communities, and to human life as a whole. 
	⁃	J. L. A. Smart’s refutation of this charge is the one I take as most instructive. 
	2.	Historicism is false. Timeless moral truth, accessible from the view from no where, is possible. The dilemma — that we must either embrace Nietzsche or Aristotle — is false. 
	4.	Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of ’virtue’ is the primary sense of virtue? Aristotle’s conception of virtue is that virtues are acquired human qualities (habits) that contribute to (and are at least partially constitutive of) eudaemonia. Those qualities that contribute to the good internal to a practice we might call skills. Skills are relative to practices, and not all practices contribute to eudaemonia. Some (grand theft, torture) are contrary to other virtues (respect for private property, kindness) and some can be plausibly seen as neutral (table tennis?). Therefore, not all MacIntyrean virtues qualify as Aristotelian virtues. 
	5.	Another group think that Aristotle’s account of virtues must be presented within a Aristotelian philosophy of nature, the “metaphysical biology” MacIntyre rejects (After Virtue 162). Such a metaphysical biology is part of Aristotle’s metaphysics of nature, including the doctrine that final causes are just as natural as efficient causes. Now, even after MacIntyre changed his mind to accept that “the teleology of human action flowed from a metaphysical foundation in the nature of the human person” (Lutz%, Whose Justice? Which Rationality? Chapter 10; After Virtue, 3rd edition, xi), he did not argue from that metaphysical foundation. Rather, he continued to argue not from teleological metaphysics but from the appearances of teleological activity — practical reasoning, practice, and moral education. As we shall see, Foot and Stephen Brown are going to advance similar arguments on the basis of a metaphysical doctrine of nature (or at least of living things); and John McDowell is going to criticize such arguments. But for MacIntyre, that conversation is a sideshow.

### Constructive Project &amp; Progress  ###

Macintyre is widely considered to be nothing but a “critic of modernity.” Anyone more than passingly familiar with his writings knows he is also a powerful positive voice for *improving* modernity. 

We must beware a misunderstanding. Any talk of “returning” to virtue is liable to sound nostalgic. Martha Nussbaum is one of many who have fallen to this misunderstanding.[@nussbaum1989recoiling] She begins her review of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* with an age-old dilemma between the social stability afforded by tradition (with its danger of hidebound error) and the social volatility endemic to critical reflection (with its opportunity of progress toward truth). She alludes to this dilemma as articulated by Aristotle: 

&gt;In the second book of the Politics, Aristotle asks whether it is a good thing to encourage changes in society. Should people be offered rewards for inventing some change in the traditional laws? No, he writes, because this would lead to instability and unnecessary tampering with what is working well. Should we, on the other hand, listen to those who wish to keep ancestral traditions fixed and immune from criticism? No again—for if we reason well we can make progress in lawmaking, just as we do in other arts and sciences.[@nussbaum1989recoiling]

Aristotle’s solution is that it should be hard but not impossible to change societal structures. Of course, we don’t have to pick just one or the other. But, putting it starkly, of the two it is better to risk instability (and gamble for progressing toward truth) than to risk hidebound error (and gamble for stability). 

Strangely, Nussbaum takes MacIntyre to be reversing Aristotle’s balance. She thinks MacIntyre is urging for betting on social stability even if it means sticking closer to existing tradition (and hence surpassing or intentionally avoiding critical reflection) than is compatible with unfettered progress.

This is not an objection to MacIntyre — it is a misreading. MacIntyre's proposed solution is not a sort of *anti-progressive* longing for the past. It is radically progressive. He rejected fideism and conservatism. His solution is not to reverse progress but to abandon the standard of progress set up in the Enlightenment and to continue under an alternative standard of progress. 

At the risk of sounding paradoxical, we might put it this way: MacIntyre's positive ethical positions are *traditional* but not *nostalgic.* In fact, his definition of tradition as an ongoing, socially-embedded argument over time entails necessarily that moral enquiry is dynamic, progressive, and even *modern*. For, to be traditional is not to be past-oriented; to be traditional is to be staunchly future-oriented, since the business of life is not only the pursuit of our telos but the transmission of everything valuable and precious to the next generation. 

The "*After Virtue* Project" is mostly constructive and creative. But up to and including *After Virtue*, MacIntyre may be seen as working to articulate criticisms that lead eventually to his epistemological and moral crisis. *After Virtue* and many of the works after have emphasized how and why to restore the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of virtue.



### Stage One: Virtue in Practices ### 
The origin of our enquiry is the concept of virtue. First we will ask a simple question, and expand the account as we elaborate the answer. What is MacIntyre's definition of virtue? 

He builds an account of virtue in three successive stages: personal, social, and traditional. Rather than attempt to encapsulate all three stages at once, it is wiser for us to retell his story in the same order. 

His first definition of virtue is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] This is the first stage or layer of his final account of virtue in *After Virtue*. A few preliminary comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are acquired. Meno asked Socrates whether virtues are "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is acquired. This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. 

Thirdly, virtues enable the achievement of *goods.* Virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally. A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both  instrumental to the achievement of certain goods and also partly constitutive of those goods. Virtues are means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. 

Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

This worry exposes deep fault lines that we must return to below. For now, we will set them aside. 

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference to the goods internal to *practices*. Practice remains a key term for MacIntyre's ethical thought. To misunderstand the term of art 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So we must also elaborate on this concept and the concept of “internal goods” which is attached to it in this first definition. 

In the following sub-sections, I’ll build up the remaining two stages of MacIntyre’s final account of virtue by elaborating on three key components: practice, self, and tradition. 

### Stage Two: Practice, Self, Tradition ###

MacIntyre's 'practice' is a term of art. A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends.  Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, political activity, and several others as examples. Let’s look more closely at farming. Farming is a social activity undertaken let's say for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

A practice may be understood not as a mere action (like scratching an itch) but an intelligible set of actions embedded in a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is not just one action, but an intelligible set of actions (tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc.). 

The goods "internal" to farming are just those that necessarily constitute the practice as it is: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers produce comestibles, but I am speaking generally.) Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Virtues relative to the practice of farming include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Another and perhaps more clear example is one MacIntyre favors: political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the polis. But others (we need not speculate how many) engage in order to achieve “external” (unessential) goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power, or securing  book deals. Effectiveness in attaining these external goods does not constitute virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just any old sort of desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

Virtue defined by practice, then, is already importantly contrasted against mere *human happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. The standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal laws but immanent and flexible standards. The internal goal of farming is the production of edible food, and its practitioners qua farmers are committed to this goal without any eye toward the broader question of farming’s place in the broader social order. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. 

Even so, MacIntyre’s account of virtue eventually transcends this notion of practice. At least it transcends the narrowest definition of practice. His account of virtue includes three layers or dimensions: individual skill (like farming), social activity (like statesmanship), and human activity (like practical reasoning about how to live well). But it is essential to grasp the first layer. 

Lutz summarizes MacIntyre’s famous passage on virtue in this way: a practice is “(1) a complex social activity that (2) enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. (3) Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, (4) the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.”[@lutz2015] 


### Stage Two: Narrative Self ###

The start of MacIntyre's account is the definition of virtue strictly in terms of practices. And practices are activities individual persons undertake. But practices are themselves inherently social. They are undertaken by individuals but they are not individualistic. 

The second stage of the account expands its scope to include the social dimension of virtue more explicitly. Practices are already understood as social activities. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. So virtue and vice already have a social character in the first stage. But the second stage makes the social factor more explicit and deepens it. 

### Enlightenment Self ### 

What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast so well I shall quote them almost in full: 

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a telos, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific telos brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a telos external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. They celebrate the empty self's elimination of these strictures as an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

Edward Oakes describes the removal of telos from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”

&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed.
&gt;This is perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy. Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of telos, rightly restored to its proper place. 


### Real Self ###

J. L. A. Garcia summarizes the “five most significant elements of MacIntyre’s rejection of modernist moral philosophies:”[@murphy2003alasdair 101-4]They are:

	1.	Underestimate the importance of tradition in formulations of justice and moral reasoning;
	2.	Embrace the fact/value dichotomy;
	3.	Present a fragmentation of the modern subject (self, person)
	4.	Lack a notion of the common good;
	5.	Privilege some groups over others. 

Each of these errors pertain to pluralization over unification, privilege many “manies” over the one. 

	In the modernist picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. My present self is a time slice of my overall total self (through time), I am able to know facts and value values, I have my own good separate and apart from your good and that of my family and community and society. 

	In the traditional picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. In the present, I owe my being and personhood to the past (especially my family who biologically gave me being) and psychologically and culturally to my tradition. I am able to know truth, for there is only one manifold of truths. My good is that of my community; my community’s good is that of mine. These data are fundamental. 

The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self. MacIntyre here argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a few comments are worth making to clarify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map. 

Three considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. 
 
If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

MacIntyre explains the relationship between virtue, practices, and institutions like this: 

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]


### Human Virtue and the charge of relativism ### 

Thus far we have said that virtues are acquired qualities that enable individuals to achieve the internal goods of practices and we have said that the self is a social (not empty) self. 

One worry that many readers have had is that MacIntyre’s virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a practice? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. But MacIntyre denies being a relativist.[@macintyre1984after xii-xiii in the 25th anniversary edition]

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third stage. He admits that there might be evil practices. We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil. If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. To avoid relativism, he must add a third layer or dimension to his account of virtue. So the account must do justice to the assumption that virtues are good for their possessor. 

The third level, then, is the broadest — that of humanity. Individuals and societies or social groups do not share much (anything?) but what we are as biological and psychological creatures. MacIntyre admits that defining virtues in terms of practices necessitates questioning whether life as a whole can be virtuous — the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition. 

So, from this broadest view, even practices and institutions can be judged by how well they accord with our overall purpose, our overall life, and our overall nature. Here we can see the closest attachment to Aristotle's original sense of 'virtue'. There must be a unity to virtue to be able to exclude evil instantiations of courage (qua staying the course in the face of danger and resistance  

### Tradition and Humanity

Now, practices are distinct from (but related to) institutions or traditions. For example, a university is an institution defined by a set of practices in which professors and students engage. Thomism a tradition defined by a set of arguments playing out over time embedded in a social community. 

### *Dependent Rational Animals* ### 

This discussion has, so far, kept itself mostly to *After Virtue*, only alluding to other works in the “*After Virtue* Project.” I would like now to add details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to *Whose Justice?*

The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally important as our independence, autonomy, or self-sufficiency. In other words, there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate the commonalities between us and other animals.He says: 

&gt;“I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Regarding (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says:  

&gt;“virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities they're specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how do while they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9] 

How do the arguments of *After Virtue* connect to these points? We may fairly draw this connection: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and virtues must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

On the one extreme, we are not mere worms or beasts (without any practical reason whatsoever) nor, on the other extreme, are we autonomous gods (without any dependency whatsoever). A human being is a practical reasoner in a human community. I would venture so far as to suggest this axiom as a definition of our species. (It is more accurate than flat-nailed featherless bipeds.) We are social animals by nature, and we are practical animals by nature, and we are reasoners by nature.

*Dependent Rational Animals* advances MacIntyre’s virtue theory in that it supplies a basis for the unity of intellectual and moral virtues, for the unity of the various moral virtues, and for unity of the various stages of the narrative of *human* life. The paradoxical notion of “wicked virtues” are explained only with this broad context of human life, and with this definition of human nature. As Christopher Lutz says, “The strength of MacIntyre's account of practices is that the pursuit of excellence in a practice entails the pursuit of virtue, but if practices can be evil, and virtues can "enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to” such an evil practice, and virtues can be anything at all.[@lutz2004tradition 101]



### Methodology ###

MacIntyre’s philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’ within *After Virtue*. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and concludes with his own account. 

 His account is historical but not historicist; it aims for universality but is not purely abstract conceptual analysis. It is, in a word, traditional. MacIntyre’s definition emerges from history but is not restricted to its history; he does not vow to conserve. Yet it does not appear “out of heaven”, unprecedented, unpredicted, unaccountable, and ready-made. 

Hence, there are two ways to disagree with MacIntyre’s definition of virtue. The first is to deny its historical roots. This critic is obliged to enter into the historical analysis and interpretation. The other is to grant the historical roots and deny his synthesis thereof. But the later approach enters into the history and enters the tradition with MacIntyre. To become a commentator on the same source texts is to consent to the terms of the enquiry that, by MacIntyre’s lights, subsume one in the Aristotelian tradition.

            <Title>### Tradition </Title>
            <Text>### Tradition
For an essential piece of MacIntyre's ethical theorizing is that every enquirer inhabits a tradition. What does this mean? First, we must take the point in its least controversial and hence most trivial sense: each enquirer is an embodied human being, living in a particular time, place, and social setting, speaking  -- and perhaps thinking -- in a given language. 

What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222]. The content of a tradition is partly self-reflexive: it is "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition." Traditions derive from a source text and continue across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Torah) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Torah, the whole Tanakh, the Talmud, and later commentaries. Also history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to conduct historical enquiry. 

With all this said, MacIntyre assumes that "we" inhabit a tradition. Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism does not correlate to the contemporary political division between “conservatives” and “liberals.” Rather, liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives”.) For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

In the (1990) Gifford Lectures, MacIntyre presented three rival versions of moral inquiry as expressions of three rival traditions.[@macintyre1990three] A book was later made of these lectures. Richard Rorty wrote that the book “deepens and defends MacIntyre’s claim that genuinely rational enquiry requires membership in a particular type of moral community. He offers the most persuasive recent restatement of the Thomist position on the relation of metaphysics to morality.” What are the “three rival versions”? He labels them ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and ‘tradition’. Now, the use of the single word ‘tradition’ to mean both the genus (with three species) *and* one of those three species is deadly confusing, so I propose to call the third tradition 'Thomism'.

The three are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. Thomists use the past as a basis for building upon and yet transcending the past. 

Thomists think, in advance, that those in the future will use the present as a foundation for building upon and yet transcending the present. 

Genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, but Freud and Marx count as well. Stephen Lutz says: 

&gt;The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, Genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.[@lutz2015]

Encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think we have *arrived*. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica*, about which one reviewer said:

&gt;The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms." 

An exemplary encyclopedist is Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. I was educated in a modern university on modern fare, as were my readers (I presume). So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. It has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Within modernity, we analytic philosophers have further source texts in Russell, Frege, and Wittgenstein, instigating arguments over how to best conduct philosophical enquiry, the definition of analytic philosophy, and the relationship between language and thought.</Text>

            <Title>Is virtue talk theistic?</Title>
            <Text>
◦	Is virtue talk a better fit for theism or atheism? Do we have to assume God exists? (No God Objection)
	There is one final question we need to ask of MacIntyre: is virtue talk inherently theistic? 

Secular Virtue Theory in Anscombe and MacIntyre
MacIntyre in conversation with Anscombe poses for us this question: is a secular, rational, metaethical account of virtue possible? Anscombe proposes a return to virtue talk to solve the problem for non-theists that concept of absolute moral obligation presupposes an absolutely obligatory divine law. Yet MacIntyre proposes a return to virtue talk and to a whole “tradition” of virtue theory in which theism has played a large part, not only for Aquinas but for Aristotle as well.That theism is important for Aristotle is a case I make in a later chapter. % Which is it? And why are these two — both Roman Catholics — the one’s asking such questions? 

MacIntyre’s historical analysis demonstrates that the Aristotelian tradition was a more or less self-contained tradition that was able to be appropriated by the late antiquity and early medieval tradition of Christianity. The Christian (Aquinas) and Jewish (Maimonides) and Muslim (Ibn Roschd) writers appropriated these scheme but did not fundamentally alter it when they placed it within a theistic context. The telos of human nature became not merely earthly but heavenly (and also earthly) since ultimate happiness begins here but is fulfilled in the hereafter. And the precepts of rational morality were baptized as not only rational but divine laws. But these modifications were more augmentations than alterations. 



Objection about religious knowledge or divine revelation
It may be objected that religious writers include a fourth source: divine revelation. If this is your objection and you are not religious, you may view this fourth alleged source with suspicion; if this is your objection and you are religious, you may view my omission of this fourth source with suspicion. 
My response is this: supposing that God exists, we can classify his moral directives under the heading of (b), instruction from moral exemplars. Whether the nature of the exemplar — divine or human — makes a difference in kind is a question I shall here leave aside.

            <Title>Summary of Cure: Telos, Virtue, Practical Reason</Title>
            <Text>Diagnosis: The loss of Telos
Rather than rushing to build our moral theory on a ready-made notion of “rationality,” we have to re-think both at the same time. 
MacIntyre’s diagnosis is that western civilization has lost the notion of telos. Telos is one of three key elements of the previous, successful Aristotelian tradition. The three part scheme of “human-nature-as-it-happens-to-be” and “human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-it-realized-its-telos” and the “precepts of rational ethics as the means for the transition from one to the other” is essentially what Aristotle lays out in Nicomachean Ethics.As we have seen in Chapter 2.   Moral discourse pre-Enlightenment consisted of examining human nature, theorizing about human nature after realizing its telos, and coordinating the journey from one to the other by means of human practical agency, including rules of morality, prudence, and politics but (especially) character traits.
Without telos, the scheme falls apart. The study of human nature as it is leads to despair; recommending the same, classical virtues becomes an exercise in arbitrariness or browbeating. 
The loss of telos means that modern moralities inherent a set of virtues or rational moral precepts and a definition of human nature and a presumption that these two are essential elements in morality — but that they can no longer make sense of their morality as a whole. 
He summarizes in the central chapter of After Virtue: “A key part of my thesis has been that modern moral utterance and practice can only be understood as a series of fragmented survivals from an older past and that the insoluble problems which they have generated for modern moral theorists will remain insoluble until this is well understood. If the deontological character of moral judgments is the ghost of conceptions of divine law which are quite alien to the metaphysics of modernity and if the teleological character is similarly the ghost of conceptions of human nature and activity which are equally not at home in the modern world, we should expect the problems of understanding and of assigning an intelligible status to moral judgments both continually to arise and as continually to prove inhospitable to philosophical solutions.” (1984, 111)
Nietzsche gives the lie to all Enlightenment moralities. They try to set up a rational basis for morality but cannot. They try to place “reason” on high but this is only a mask for the will to power.  The Enlightenment moralities were tried and found wanting. But the Aristotelian tradition that the Enlightenment abandoned still may be tried and found true. 
Why did the Enlightenment thinkers lose faith in telos? There are empirical and scientific arguments that teleology is natural. There are philosophical arguments and common sense appearances. 
But the older Aristotelian tradition was in crisis. And the Enlightenment thinkers found a way to establish a new, rival tradition. Bacon and others expunged teleology from their mechanical world-picture. 

Nietzsche or Aristotle
If MacIntyre’s deconstructive argument is correct, then modern moralities like deontology and utilitarianism (including all their trappings and purport of objectivity) are just as expressivistic as emotivism. 
There are two possible prognoses of this illness. The first is to abandon the purport of objectivity. This option follows expressivism and, ultimately, ends with Nietzsche. We unmask all rational justifications of morality. We opt for cunning rather than wisdom; amplify our means to deteriorated ends. Obviously, MacIntyre does not think Nietzsche is right about morality nor rationality. Rather, MacIntyre opts for Aristotle. 
The second prognosis is to abandon the fiction of total, individual, community-less, autonomy. If we see ourselves, again, as members of a community within a shared tradition, with shared origins, goals, and standards, then the objectivity and rational basis of morality becomes intelligible again. 

Aristotle
Revisiting Aristotle’s ethics as a seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”, MacIntyre finds that “Human beings, like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics.” (148 %)
For Aristotle, as we have seen, the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos.” (148 %)
The right action may be done without the relevant virtue being the cause. But the virtue in a person is the cause of the correct end of purposive action. 
For Kant, acting against inclination (if need be) was an important element of having a moral motive, a motive from rational duty. But for Aristotle, inclinations themselves can be trained. They can be helpmeets toward doing one’s duty. 
A virtuous person obeys civil laws (150 %). At the same time, there are “absolute prohibited” actions. Such actions warrant exile. Absolute prohibitions are not based on an absolute divine law, but on absolute limits of human nature beyond which the agent is no longer even a human being. 

The Scheme Restored
If the Aristotelian tradition restores telos to moral philosophy, what difference does it make? What is that telos, and how does virtue contribute to it? 

Human Nature
Humans can be excellent or the opposite of excellent. We are practical reasoners who make judgments of true and false and also make judgments upon which we act. Our excellence depends in part upon our effectiveness in pursuing what we judge to be good but also in part on what we judge to be good. Our excellence also depends, in part, on the social role we play within our tradition and over our whole life. So the virtues are needed for each of our roles and practices, as well as for life (human life) as a whole. 

What is a virtue? 
	So what is a virtue, in this light? For MacIntyre a virtue is an “acquired human quality.” So, virtues are good for humans  (rather than those qualities that are good for plants, environments, etc.). Virtues are acquired rather than somehow automatic like breathing or instinctual like avoiding pain. But which qualities? A virtue is an acquired human quality that enables its possessor “to achieve those goods which are internal to practices” (MacIntyre 1984, 191). The absence of virtue “effectively prevents” achieving the goods internal to practices. 
	So what is the term of art, “practice”? A practice is an activity carried out in a community of other practitioners according to common standards, a common history, and common ends (teloi). Lutz summarizes MacIntyre’s famous passage in this way: A practice is “(1) a complex social activity that (2) enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. (3) Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, (4) the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.” (Lutz, After Virtue 187). 
	 Examples include chess, medicine, farming, politics. So, in a bit more detail: farmers are a community of practitioners who belong to a broader tradition of cultivating land for food and other goods (water, wood, game hunting, or what have you). The goods internal to farming are obvious products like wheat, grapes, corn, tobacco, perhaps others. There are standards by which farmers judge themselves and each other as excelling or failing in the understood ends. Those qualities that enable farmers to farm well are virtues. Farming is a tradition. One joins the community through apprenticeship and becomes subject to the standards of that community. 
	MacIntyre’s favored example of a practice is political activity. Political activity can be done for reasons internal or external to the practice. External goods that can come from a career engaging in political activity are goods like fame, power, prestige, or book deals. Excellence in attaining these goods, however, does not constitute virtue. The internal goods of political activity are a free and happy polity. 
	Virtues are those qualities by which the practitioner overcomes the temptation to pursue external goods. 
	But thus far, the definition of a practice virtually begs to be read as a type of relativism. Is torture a practice? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think one can be an effective or ineffective car thief. But MacIntyre denies being a relativist (MacIntyre, After Virtue (Prologue) xii-xiii). His response to the charge or relativism obliges him to give a brief account of how and why someone from a tradition might evaluative her own tradition, by provisionally adopting via philosophical imagination the terms and way of thinking of a rival tradition. Even so, there might be practices that are evil. So an adequate account of virtue that does justice to the assumption that virtues are good for the possessor 
	But there is more to virtue than the excellence relative to a particular practice. Practices are indeed indexed to social activities. So the “second level” of virtue are qualities indexed to individual agents. At this second level, virtues are qualities to avoid temptations away from pursuing what is best in the practices that partly constitute life and in life as a whole (201). 
	This second level is inadequate since humans are individuals but not merely individuals. The “detachable self” that divorces itself from the past and from community is not the real self. MacIntyre’s example is the present day black American whose identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites, or present day Irishman whose identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Irish to 18th century English. It is false to assert that my identity has nothing to do what what happened in the past. 
	There is a third level. That level is the social dimension. Since some practices are not individualistic, neither are virtues individualistic. Rather, 
	“The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the  of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context” (MacIntyre, After Virtue. 223%).
	We may summarize MacIntyre’s concept of virtue as a quality of human beings, but human beings considered under three aspects: humans are considered as social animals, as individuals, and as social role-players. 
	With all three aspects in view, we can see that the most general virtuous qualities contribute to the flourishing of human being qua practical reasoner. The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. The “human nature” that is universally distributed across each member of our species is the capacity (sometimes unrealized) to become practical reasoners. Practical reasoners is what we are. Not just homo sapiens sapiens, but man who thinks what to do. 
	Narrowing our scope from this most broad level, other virtues contribute to excellence in various practices relating to social roles and to individual agency. These are an overlapping set of virtues. 
	We must be clear that simply “emphasizing” virtue or placing ethical primacy on virtues is not enough to restore the Aristotelian tradition. We can easily, and some already have, co-opt virtue talk within a teleological nihilism that renders such talk expressive of personal (foundationless) moral preferences or a will to power. Some readers indeed will read my case in these chapters as expressive of my personal moral preferences or a power play. I deny the charge. But it may be impossible to convince some that my denial of the charge is best explained by my innocence, rather than some Machiavellian strategy of keeping a will to power secret in hopes of increasing the chances it will come off. Virtue, outside of a context of end-directed human nature, MacIntyre thinks is just as hopeless as trying to build a justified agreement or intelligible disagremeent on stipulative concepts of rationality, duty, or happiness. 

What is our telos?
The concept of telos is an important unifying element in ethical theory. He admits that defining virtues in terms of practices necessitates questioning whether life as a whole can be virtuous — the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life” (203%). But integrity is not identical to happiness. 
	Contemporary thinking fragments human life into distinct stages (childhood, maturity, old age) rather than keeping synoptic vision of human life as a unity; contemporary thinking also fragments the whole life into a series of atomized actions, and fragments the individual human self (the one living the life) into atomized social roles. 
	By contrast, a more accurate picture of human life is that of a narrative. (After Virtue, Chp. 15). Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. 
	For us, the end (terminus) of our narrative is death. And as a narrative it has ends (goals). “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable” (215%). The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single telos governing all the moments of our “quest.” 
	Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos).
	The goods available “in and through [various] practices” are achievable by various virtues; but what about the simple, unified and unifying question: “What is good for me?” (218). What is good, all things considered? 
	The virtues needed for “integrity,” for a totalized and unified good as sought and perhaps achieved in my own life, are something over and above the virtues needed within various practices. “The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome th charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good” (219%). 
	These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good” (219). 
	This reasoning leads MacIntyre to the following “provisional” conception of our human telos: “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is” (210). So our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. But the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our telos consists in. 
	MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist. 






◦	What is phronesis/practical reason and practical wisdom?
For a virtuous agent to develop virtues, she must be practically wise. She must, at least, be practical. The centrality of practical reason is one of MacIntyre’s recurring points. There is a close connection, he argues, between moral reasoning (narrowly about what is right and wrong) and practical reasoning (broadly about what to do). As Lutz puts it: 
“Modern moral philosophy separates moral reasoning about duties and obligations from practical reasoning about ends and practical deliberation about the means to one’s ends, and in doing so it separates morality from practice. Kant separates moral and practical reasoning explicitly in The Critique of Pure Reason (Critique of Pure Reason, A800/B828–A819/B847) and in The Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals (First Section, pp. 393-405.); Mill makes the same separation in Utilitarianism (chapter 2).” 
Modern moral philosophers had explicitly severed the connection. But if people’s avowed reasons for action were simply a subset of their reasons in general (including reasons to believe, feel, do, be) then such a severing is not a clear distinction but a violence. 
Lutz continues: “For Aristotle, moral philosophy is a study of practical reasoning, and the excellences or virtues that Aristotle recommends in the Nicomachean Ethics are the intellectual and moral excellences that make a moral agent effective as an independent practical reasoner. AV criticizes modern liberal individualism and scientific determinism for separating practical reasoning from morality and political life; it proposes instead a return to Aristotelian ethics and politics.” (Lutz %) 
In Dependent Rational Animals, MacIntyre emphasis that prudence is required to enable an agent to apply rules well (93). In the absence of rules, the prudent person can figure out what to do; and in the presence of irrelevant general rules the prudent person can judge that they are irrelevant and temporarily disregard them. 

The Concept of Tradition
The concept of tradition does important work for MacIntyre. A tradition is not mere conservatism of Burke or contemporary political pundits; that kind of conservatism is part of the broader tradition of liberal individualism he critiques. He calls a living tradition “an historically extended, socially embodied argument, and an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition” (222%). 

After Virtue Outro
MacIntyre began his career in the 1970s as a Marxist critiquing “modern liberal individualism” — a stand in for many ideologies. Eventually however, he rejected in Marxism as just another form of modern liberal individualism. He turned to Aristotle's ethics as a school of thought and the tradition in which moral inquiry, and the development of rationality could actually take place. Since After Virtue, we can read it's works as trying to complete the defense of this project.

            <Text>### Critic of modernity

He has argued that modern moral philosophy -- the "Enlightenment tradition" of liberalism -- is incoherent by its own standards. As a member of the modern tradition, he gradually discovered its inadequacies.  His attempt to trace the root of the mistake about moral judgments lead him to a mistake at the heart of Enlightenment modernity. As a social, political, and moral project, the Enlightenment has been, MacIntyre argues, a failure by its own standards. One of his most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe...Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance... all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. But an obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. Neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity. An explanation of this disagreement is that we are trying to get by using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. But the problem is not merely academic. The social and political fabric is woven from the thread of morality, so many of the ills of modern life can be traced to our inability to share a substantive conception of the good and the good life. Due to his many critical works, MacIntyre earned a reputation as a "critic of modernity."[@mcmylor2005alasdair] 



### MacIntyre's history and project ###

My goal in this chapter is to summarize and analyze MacIntyre's theory of virtue and practical rationality. However, it would be wise to begin by presenting some of his intellectual biography and his view of tradition. 



For an essential piece of MacIntyre's ethical theorizing is that every enquirer inhabits a tradition. What does this mean? First, we must take the point in its least controversial and hence most trivial sense: each enquirer is an embodied human being, living in a particular time, place, and social setting, speaking  -- and perhaps thinking -- in a given language. 

What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222]. The content of a tradition is partly self-reflexive: it is "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition." Traditions derive from a source text and continue across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Torah) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Torah, the whole Tanakh, the Talmud, and later commentaries. Also history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to conduct historical enquiry. 

With all this said, MacIntyre assumes that "we" inhabit a tradition. Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism does not correlate to the contemporary political division between “conservatives” and “liberals.” Rather, liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives”.) For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

In the (1990) Gifford Lectures, MacIntyre presented three rival versions of moral inquiry as expressions of three rival traditions.[@macintyre1990three] A book was later made of these lectures. Richard Rorty wrote that the book “deepens and defends MacIntyre’s claim that genuinely rational enquiry requires membership in a particular type of moral community. He offers the most persuasive recent restatement of the Thomist position on the relation of metaphysics to morality.” What are the “three rival versions”? He labels them ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and ‘tradition’. Now, the use of the single word ‘tradition’ to mean both the genus (with three species) *and* one of those three species is deadly confusing, so I propose to call the third tradition 'Thomism'.

The three are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. Thomists use the past as a basis for building upon and yet transcending the past. Thomists think, in advance, that those in the future will use the present as a foundation for building upon and yet transcending the present. 

Genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, but Freud and Marx count as well. Stephen Lutz says: 

&gt;The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, Genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.[@lutz2015]

Encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think we have *arrived*. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica*, about which one reviewer said:

&gt;The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms." 

An exemplary encyclopedist is Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. I was educated in a modern university on modern fare, as were my readers (I presume). So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. It has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Within modernity, we analytic philosophers have further source texts in Russell, Frege, and Wittgenstein, instigating arguments over how to best conduct philosophical enquiry, the definition of analytic philosophy, and the relationship between language and thought. 



### Growing up
MacIntyre grew up inside two cultures: a rustic Scottish fishing culture and an elite Scottish intellectual culture. For this reason, in part, his theory emphasizes the importance of being able to understand multiple cultures. He attended Epsom College at age sixteen where he was tutored by R. G. Collinwood. He acquired an interest in ethics during undergraduate study and wrote his M.A. thesis critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. 




### Critic of modernity

He has argued that modern moral philosophy -- the "Enlightenment tradition" of liberalism -- is incoherent by its own standards. As a member of the modern tradition, he gradually discovered its inadequacies.  His attempt to trace the root of the mistake about moral judgments lead him to a mistake at the heart of Enlightenment modernity. As a social, political, and moral project, the Enlightenment has been, MacIntyre argues, a failure by its own standards. One of his most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe...Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance... all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. But an obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement.

The social and political fabric is woven from the thread of morality, so many of the ills of modern life can be traced to our inability to share a substantive conception of the good and the good life. Due to his many critical works, MacIntyre earned a reputation as a "critic of modernity."[@mcmylor2005alasdair] 



### Despair of crisis? 
Now, there are many modern philosophers who have gone into similar crises. The become critics of the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity. Such become distrustful thought, language, and rationality itself; they become "the masters of suspicion."[@ricoeur1970freud. "Three masters, seemingly mutually exclusive, dominate the school of suspicion: Marx, Nietzche, and Freud." "]  MacIntyre took a surprising course. His crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover a more adequate answer to some philosophical problem. His criticisms lead him to find an older and still vital foundation amidst the ruins. It is upon this foundation -- the Aristotelian tradition of virtue -- that MacIntyre continues to build.


### Kuhn
The story of his avoidance of despair and deconstructionism is an interesting one. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences.[@kuhn1975structure] What if a similar structure obtained in scientific revolutions and in moral revolutions? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn's (and Feyerabend’s) analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] 

### Kuhn's method and paradigm
Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful."[@feyerabend1993against] He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack. Kuhn's concept of a paradigm is a nice analogue for MacIntyre's concept of a tradition.
 The concept of "tradition" is liable to fatal misunderstanding. I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain it at the outset.  

### Emotivism ###

What troubled him about emotivism in particular and modern metaethics in general was an assumption shared by emotivists, intuitionists, naturalists, and error theorists that moral terms are referential. He argued that this assumption is a mistake. By contrast, he concluded that the significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Instead of referring (or failing to refer) to a special 'moral property', all evaluative reasoning practical reasoning, reasoning what to do. Hence, there can be no adequate theory of ethics apart from a theory of (practical) rationality. A recurring them of MacIntyre's work is that moral reasoning is practical reasoning. That is, moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself. 




### Virtue
MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a specific, living, moral tradition -- the Aristotelian tradition. This is one of MacIntyre's recurring themes: ethical concepts have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical terms and concepts when we have some historical perspective on them. Furthermore, *we* have a history. Practical concepts such as the self, practice, the *telos* or end of life, and virtue are all  MacIntyre realized that we all inhabit a tradition -- even putatively anti-traditionalist moderns. So we must know ourselves as members of a tradition, as members of a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. These themes -- tradition have guided the construction of MacIntyre's virtue theory. 


### Conclusion of introduction
These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.  

But it is worth saying at the outset that MacIntyre readers fall into two broad camps: those who are, on the whole, more critical of modernity, and those who, on the whole, are less critical of modernity. The former group tend to find MacIntyre's diagnosis compelling and his solutions exhilarating.  Restoring historical perspective on ethics, restoring ethical reasoning to its place within practical reasoning, and restoring *telos* promises to make available the resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The hope of a restored morality brings with it the hope of a restoration of social and political integrity. MacIntyre invites such readers to see the point of education, politics, and social life once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, to restore an intelligibility to these activities and pursuits that many of us moderns can hardly imagine. 
 
The latter group tend to find MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites such readers to reflect on themselves and on our common history. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modernity had these fatal flaws, would this solution be a good one?"
Now, there are many modern philosophers who have gone into similar crises. The become critics of the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity. Such become distrustful thought, language, and rationality itself; they become "the masters of suspicion."[@ricoeur1970freud.

            <Text>### Emotivism ###

What troubled him about emotivism in particular and modern metaethics in general was an assumption shared by emotivists, intuitionists, naturalists, and error theorists that moral terms are referential. He argued that this assumption is a mistake. By contrast, he concluded that the significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Instead of referring (or failing to refer) to a special 'moral property', all evaluative reasoning practical reasoning, reasoning what to do. Hence, there can be no adequate theory of ethics apart from a theory of (practical) rationality. A recurring them of MacIntyre's work is that moral reasoning is practical reasoning. That is, moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself.</Text>

            <Text>### Virtue
MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a specific, living, moral tradition -- the Aristotelian tradition. This is one of MacIntyre's recurring themes: ethical concepts have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical terms and concepts when we have some historical perspective on them. Furthermore, *we* have a history. Practical concepts such as the self, practice, the *telos* or end of life, and virtue are all  MacIntyre realized that we all inhabit a tradition -- even putatively anti-traditionalist moderns. So we must know ourselves as members of a tradition, as members of a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources.

            <Title>Do we have a right to objectivity rhetoric?</Title>
            <Text>Do we have a right to objectivity rhetoric? 

Objections
Some object to objectivity rhetoric on the grounds that it is indefensible. Rosenberg’s article “Objectivity and Modern Idealism” excellently summarizes the way in which post-Kantian debates over idealism have transformed and re-appeared in contemporary debates over objectivity. But do we have a right to such language? John McDowell’s mind/world account is an attempt to answer in the negative, to therapeutically exorcise the worries that arise from such a sideways-on picture of our relation to the world. 

Stefan Bird-Pollan once commented on a paper of mine to the effect that my critique of John McDowell did not take into account this critique of a sideways on mind/world picture. 

On the other hand 

I think our right to this language is indisputable. 

Arguments
For one, expunging such language is impossible. 

If it is indeed impossible, then we ought to explain why it is. It is impossible not to think and talk about mind-world fit because such a picture is a true picture. I do not know how such a faith in the inherent correctness of the indespensible features of rationality is to be defended against the faithless. I have not yet suffered enough time in the dialectical vice grip of idealism, skepticism, Humeanism or whatever it is that made Immanual Kant no longer a platonist and a dogmatist. I am still a platonist and a dogmatist. </Text>

            <Text>### Conclusion of introduction
These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.  

But it is worth saying at the outset that MacIntyre readers fall into two broad camps: those who are, on the whole, more critical of modernity, and those who, on the whole, are less critical of modernity. The former group tend to find MacIntyre's diagnosis compelling and his solutions exhilarating.  Restoring historical perspective on ethics, restoring ethical reasoning to its place within practical reasoning, and restoring *telos* promises to make available the resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The hope of a restored morality brings with it the hope of a restoration of social and political integrity. MacIntyre invites such readers to see the point of education, politics, and social life once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, to restore an intelligibility to these activities and pursuits that many of us moderns can hardly imagine. 
 
The latter group tend to find MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites such readers to reflect on themselves and on our common history. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modernity had these fatal flaws, would this solution be a good one?"

            <Title>11 The Key Questions</Title>
            <Text>
What is a virtue? And what does virtue talk do for ethical theory? This dissertation answers that virtue talk is indispensable for our ethical theorizing and for our ethical living, because we all have an interest and obligation in becoming fully human, being happy; and because the moral (and more broadly practical) standards or norms that fix what is right and wrong, admirable and despicable, are real, fundamental features of reality, like the laws of physics and mathematics. 

Virtue talk is an old phenomenon. And though words like “virtue” along with “honor” fell out of fashion for a bit, they are back in fashion and in force. But objections and clarifying questions loom large. 

Darwell’s essay argues that metaethics (or analytic ethics or critical ethics) is best practiced within a dynamic union with normative ethics. (The combination of the two, Darwall suggests, might be called philosophical ethics.) Not only was this how Moore approached ethics in 1903, but it is how many contemporary writers are approaching ethics, despite the trend in the middle of the century to write either about metaethical issues or ignore them for the sake of normative ethical ones. 

I take my task to be to advance anglophone virtue ethics but to do so by virtue of addressing head on some of the most pressing, most challenging, and (to me at least) most interesting objections and questions. Objections come from opponents and questions from often confused bystanders.  

In one sense, the normative ethical content of virtue ethics is simple: go become virtuous. There is much more to it than that. But virtue education tries to instill virtues in children; virtue politics tries to create polities in which it is “easy to be good” and politicians who are scrupulous, upstanding, wise, honest, and trustworthy; virtue epistemology tries to show what character traits are necessary or beneficial or sufficient for being the kind of person who can know things. And so on. 

But then the questions begin: which traits are virtues? What do you mean by “virtuous”? Is there really happiness? 

Many of the objections and questions for virtue ethical writers like MacIntyre, Foot, Hursthouse, and McDowell are objections and questions with correlates outside of virtue ethics. 

The key questions in short are these: 

THE KEY QUESTIONS
	1.	What is a virtue? 
	2.	What is happiness?
	3.	What is phronesis?
	4.	Why by virtuous? 
	5.	Is virtue ethics a species of metaethical realism (if so, constructivist or stance-independent)? 
	6.	What do evaluative terms mean? (Non-Cognitivism Challenge)
	7.	How do we know what is virtuous to do or be? (Moral Disagreement Objection)
	8.	Is normativity natural? Is nature normative or teleological? (No Natural Teleology Objection)
	9.	What is human nature?  Is there a human nature? (No Human Nature Objection)
	10.	What is rationality? (No Sui Generis Rationality Objection)
	11.	Is virtue talk a better fit for theism or atheism?  (No God Objection)

But each question allows for a variety of sub-questions. 

VIRTUE, HAPPINESS, REASON - EXPLICATION OF POSITIVE THOERY
1. What is a virtue? 
	A practice? (MacIntyre 1984)
	Do they benefit their possessor? 
	Virtue and right action
	Being for and Excellence
	Is morality rational or emotional or both? (Hursthouse 1999).
	Are virtues united, or plural?
2. What is happiness and its relation to virtue?
	Is it different from flourishing?
	Is happiness normative?
3. What is practical reason and its relation to virtue? (Substantive reason vs. Instrumental reason)
	Adams gives up the idea that practical wisdom is the heart of virtues (2006)
	Kamketar objects (2010). 
	How does the  normativity of moral virtues relate to the normativity of epistemic virtues? Are epistemic norms (that lead to intellectual virtue) relevantly similar to moral norms (that lead to moral virtue)?
	Does our account of reason explain our norms or vindicate them?
	What is normativity’s relation to rationality?
	Plan-making? (Gibbard 2008) 
4. Why by virtuous? 
	Is the pursuit of virtue egoistic? (Hursthouse 1999; Adams 2006)
	Are virtue-norms sufficiently action guiding to be useful? (Hursthouse 1999)
	Are moral reasons necessarily motivating?  (Moral internalism v. Externalism) (Shafer-Landau 2003)
	Are practical reasons necessarily motivation? (Reasons internalism) (Shafer-Landau 2003)
	Is there reason to be altruistic? (Adams 2006)
	Is there reason to care for animals, and the environment? 

OBJECTIONS PERTAINING TO REALISM (chapter 1)
5. Is virtue ethics a species of realism? (MacIntyre)	Could there be virtue expressivism? (Cognitivism) (Shafer-Landau)
	Or is it idealism? (Hursthouse) (chapter 2)

OBJECTIONS PERTAINING TO ETHICAL NATURALISM AND NON-NATURALISM
10. What kinds of facts are virtues? Natural facts? Human attributes?
	Two Supervenient Challenges from Shafer-Landau

OBJECTIONS PERTAINING TO LANGUAGE AND NORMATIVITY (chapter 2)
5. What do evaluative terms about virtue (courage, moderation) mean? 
	Do they semantically refer? (Tannsjo 2010)
	Are they functional concepts (Foot 2002)
		 
OBJECTIONS PERTAINING TO MORAL KNOWLEDGE
7. How do we know what is good or what ought to be? (Shafer-Landau 2003, Part Five)
	Which list of virtues is justifiable as really the virtues? 
	How do we know (if we do) which habitual actions or character traits are virtues? (Moral foundationalism v. Coherentism)
	Specifically, how might we adjudicate disagreements between cultures or individuals over the value of particular traits (humility, celibacy, assertiveness, callousness)?
	Is ethics a science? By the way, is science just the hard sciences, the natural sciences, or any systematic discipline of knowledge? 
	 If humans have evolved, does that debunk rationality?


OBJECTIONS PERTAINING TO NORMATIVITY
	Is nature normative?  Moore opens up the discussion for a cosmic rather than merely human perspective when he includes the beauty of nature. This cosmological perspective is welcome.Panayot Butchvarov, “Ethics Dehumanized” in Metaethics After Moore. % Human beings need not and ought not occupy “center stage” of our ethical thinking.


OBJECTIONS PERTAINING TO ANTHROPOLOGY
9. 	What is human nature?  Is there a human nature? (No Human Nature Objection)
 (McDowell 1996)
	Are we animals? (George 
	Are we different from animals (Brown 2008)?
	Are we “social animals”? 
	Are humans essential rational? 
	Are we supernatural?
	Have humans evolved or not?
	Can this question be answered from “outside” from a 3rd person perspective, (from cosmology, Darwinian biology, psychology, anthropology) or only from the “inside” (in light of our own first-personal view of ourselves from introspection and from reflection within our society, culture, religious experience, friendships, and family)? 
	Are there such things as character traits? (Doris 1998; Harman 1999).
	How do they belong to Bill rather than Ted? How is a virtue mine? (Smith 2003)
	Does moral luck determine your virtue? (Harper says this was the view of the ancient world.)


10. What is rationality? No Sui Generis Rationality Objection




OBJECTIONS PERTAINING TO THEISM, NATURALISM
12. Is virtue talk better conceived within naturalism or theism?
	Is nature normative and teleological? Moral naturalism v. Non-naturalism (metaphysics)
	Are all living beings normative?
	“A major battlefield of contemporary discussion concerns the question how such philosophical key notions as [these]: Self, Subjectivity, First person perspective, Moral values, Content, Free will. Can be accommodated in a naturalistic outlook of reality.” (How Successful Is Naturalism? 7). 
Is Neo-Aristotelianism broadly naturalistic? It seems so, it seems not.
Even supposing that neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is naturalistic, how are we to understand “natural properties”? Even grounding moral facts in facts about human nature, how are we to understand nature? Is nature teleological? Is there such thing as “natural normativity”?
Are humans divine? (Aristotle)
Is virtue ethics an alternative to theistic (divine law) ethics, or another version of it? (Anscombe)
Is a secular content-full morality possible in virtue ethics? (Engelhard)
11. Are values ‘queer’, discontinuous? (Shafer-Landau, Mackie)


The answers to these questions will be developed out of an analysis of MacIntyre, Foot, McDowell, Hursthouse, Brown, and Adams. </Text>

They express thick, descriptive/normative concepts that refer to real moral properties. 

Buhler Keith, 7/14/15, 8:33 AM
Some normative truths are self-evident; others require epistemic and moral virtues.

Buhler Keith, 7/14/15, 8:33 AM
Human nature is a bundle of first- and second-order capacities. 

We are animals by nature and rational by nature, though rationality is inherently normative and not just descriptive. 


Buhler Keith, 7/14/15, 8:35 AM
Yes, because humans instantiate human nature, and each human is a person whose personhood endures over time and grounds stable traits, some of which are in control of the agent, but not all.

            <Title># MacIntyre 6</Title>
            <Text># Alasdair MacIntyre: Virtue and Reason in Practice 

This chapter analyzes Alasdair MacIntyre's theory of virtue and practical rationality.[^1] MacIntyre (born 1929) is often classified as a "virtue ethicist" but he rejects the label insofar as it suggests an essentially modern moral virtue ethics rather than a real restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Nevertheless, he has contributed to virtue ethics, as well as a surprising number of other fields: the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education, sociology, and more. His work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations. For example, he paints a memorable picture of emotivism as a “culture” with its own paradigmatic “characters”: the Manager and the Therapist.[@macintyre1984after chapter 3] In a word, he embodies the ideal Roy Sellars commended, that the philosopher “should be well-grounded both in the history of philosophy and in the sciences, and... should engage philosophically with the major moral, social, and political issues of the day.”[@mcdonoughroy] 


Due in part to his multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had an enormous interdisciplinary influence. His eighteen books and greater than three hundred published articles have had an indelible impact on moral and political philosophy. Jack Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what John Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre re-invigorated analytic ethical philosophy, inaugurating the ascendence of late twentieth-century virtue ethics.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.] Some find his critiques and his conclusions radical. They may be radical, but they are certainly popular. He has been widely read, both inside and outside the university. He states without irony that his ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks. It is unclear what MacIntyre's final contribution to philosophy will be.  Those familiar with the expansiveness of his research will not be too quick to declare that his evolution is finished. 

[^1]: MacIntyre's ethical theory is best presented in the “*After Virtue* Project”, which consists of *After Virtue* (1984), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988); *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990); and *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999). 

### MacIntyre's history and project ###

My goal in this chapter is to present, analyze, and defend MacIntyre's theory of virtue and practical rationality. However, because of his emphasis on history and narrative, it would be wise to view MacIntyre's theory in light of his intellectual biography. This will introduce two major themes: history and tradition. 

MacIntyre grew up inside two cultures: a rustic Scottish fishing culture and an elite Scottish intellectual culture. For this reason, in part, his theory emphasizes the importance of being able to understand multiple cultures. He attended Epsom College at age sixteen where he was tutored by R. G. Collinwood. He acquired an interest in ethics during undergraduate study and wrote his M.A. thesis critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. But the trouble he found with emotivism was also the trouble with other modern moral philosophies. 

One of MacIntyre’s enduring themes is that we all inhabit a tradition. His critique of modernity is a critique of a tradition, and his eventual solution is the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Yet the concept is liable to fatal misunderstanding. I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain 'tradition' at the outset. What does it mean to assert that “we all inhabit a tradition”? Most trivially, it means each of us are embodied, live in a time, place, and social setting, and speak a given language. More interestingly, it means that each of us (intellectuals at least) owe our conceptual resources to a tradition. What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222]. The content of a tradition is partly self-reflexive: it is "… an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition." Traditions derive from a source text and continue across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Torah) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how best to interpret and apply the Torah, the whole Tanakh, the Talmud, and later commentaries. Also history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, Thucydides, and Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to conduct historical enquiry. 

Even if this notion of tradition is clear (I shall discuss it much more below), some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, Enlightenment modernity, or simply modernity. It is not politically left-leaning or liberal in the contemporary sense but includes right-leaning conservatives as well. For simplicity, in most instances I shall simply use the term ‘modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

MacIntyre’s most thorough treatment of the theme of how traditions conduct moral enquiry is the (1990) Gifford Lectures. There he presents three “rival versions of moral enquiry.” They are ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and a third version he simply calls ‘tradition’ but I will call ‘Thomism.’ The three rivals are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. For example, genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, but Freud and Marx count as well. Stephen Lutz says: 

&gt;The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.[@lutz2015]

By contrast, encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think we have *arrived*. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica*, about which one reviewer said:

&gt;The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy and the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms.

Another exemplary encyclopedist is Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. 

MacIntyre's conviction is that we, even we anti-traditional moderns, inhabit a tradition. Yet we are not trapped by it. Members of a tradition are able to discover the inadequacies of their tradition and discover the resources of a rival tradition. This is just what happened to him. How did MacIntyre “deconvert” from modernism? It began with ethics. What troubled him about emotivism in particular and modern metaethics in general was an assumption shared by emotivists, intuitionists, naturalists, and error theorists that moral terms are *referential.* If moral terms within moral judgments are supposed to pick out a property in the world, then either we must identify that property or (if we cannot) conclude that moral terms are literally meaningless. He argued that this assumption is a mistake. Instead, he concluded that the significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Instead of referring (or failing to refer) to a special 'moral property', all evaluative reasoning is practical reasoning. We employ moral judgments when we must evaluate something or when we must reason about what to do. Moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. Hence, there can be no adequate theory of ethics apart from a theory of (practical) rationality. 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. It was the tradition MacIntyre was raised in. It is the tradition I was raised in, as (I presume) were my readers. So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is an argument extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and parts of western Europe. Modernity has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reforming civil law; Kant wrote the three *Critiques* but also the *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. 

As a member of the modern tradition, he gradually discovered its inadequacies. His attempt to trace the root of the mistake about moral judgments lead him to a mistake at the heart of Enlightenment modernity. As a social, political, and moral project, the Enlightenment has been, MacIntyre argues, a failure by its own standards. One of his most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe...Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance... all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. But an obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. Neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity. An explanation of this disagreement is that we are trying to get by using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry, like genealogy, incoherent by its own standards. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three]  The problem with modernity is not merely academic. The social and political fabric is woven from the thread of morality, so many of the ills of modern life can be traced to our inability to share a substantive conception of the good and the good life.  

Due to his many critical works, MacIntyre earned a reputation as a "critic of modernity."[@mcmylor2005alasdair] But what is unusual about him is not his criticism but his eventual solution. There are many modern philosophers who have gone into similar crises. The become critics of the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity. Such become distrustful thought, language, and rationality itself; they become "the masters of suspicion."[@ricoeur1970freud. "Three masters, seemingly mutually exclusive, dominate the school of suspicion: Marx, Nietzche, and Freud." "]  MacIntyre took a surprising course. His crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover a more adequate answer to some philosophical problem. His criticisms lead him to find an older and still vital foundation amidst the ruins. It is upon this foundation -- the Aristotelian tradition of virtue -- that MacIntyre continues to build.

The story of his avoidance of despair and deconstructionism is an interesting one. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences.[@kuhn1975structure] What if a similar structure obtained in scientific revolutions and in moral revolutions? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn's (and Feyerabend’s) analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful."[@feyerabend1993against] He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack. Kuhn's concept of a paradigm is a nice analogue for MacIntyre's concept of a tradition.

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a specific, living, moral tradition -- the Aristotelian tradition. This is one of MacIntyre's recurring themes: ethical concepts have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical terms and concepts when we have some historical perspective on them. Furthermore, *we* have a history. Practical concepts such as the self, practice, the *telos* or end of life, and virtue are all  MacIntyre realized that we all inhabit a tradition -- even putatively anti-traditionalist moderns. So we must know ourselves as members of a tradition, as members of a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. These themes -- tradition have guided the construction of MacIntyre's virtue theory. 


These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.  

But it is worth saying at the outset that MacIntyre readers fall into two broad camps: those who are, on the whole, more critical of modernity, and those who, on the whole, are less critical of modernity. The former group tend to find MacIntyre's diagnosis compelling and his solutions exhilarating.  Restoring historical perspective on ethics, restoring ethical reasoning to its place within practical reasoning, and restoring *telos* promises to make available the resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The hope of a restored morality brings with it the hope of a restoration of social and political integrity. MacIntyre invites such readers to see the point of education, politics, and social life once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, to restore an intelligibility to these activities and pursuits that many of us moderns can hardly imagine. 

The latter group tend to find MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites such readers to reflect on themselves and on our common history. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modernity had these fatal flaws, would this solution be a good one?"

### Chapter outline ###

This chapter is divided into four sections. 

**Section 1: Virtue**.  Section 1 summarizes and discusses MacIntyre’s theory of virtue and practical rationality as presented in his four main virtue books. I shall present his definition of virtue, and discuss six supporting concepts. They are: practice, self, *telos*, human nature, tradition-constituted rationality, and *phronesis* or practical wisdom.

**Section 2: Objections**. Section 2 presents a sampling of the powerful objections critics -- modernists, postmodernists, and MacIntyre’s own fellow Thomists -- have offered to various aspects of MacIntyre’s theory. It will be impossible to do justice to the excellent replies from MacIntyre's sizable crowd of friends and opponents. Instead I shall focus on three families of superlatively important objections. The first family of objections pertains to moral relativism and perspectivism. Is MacIntyre successful in defending the Aristotelian tradition of moral realism? The second family of objections pertains to his concept of tradition-constituted rationality. Is his theory of rationality even coherent? Is it clear enough? And can *it* avoid the charge of relativism? The third family of objections pertains to teleology. In attempting to shoehorn teleology back into ethics, is MacIntyre accepting tenets from a discredited Aristotelian metaphysics of nature? Can't modern morality get along well enough without *telos*? 

**Section 3: Discussion**. Section 3 discusses these objections and offers answers. While I cannot promise to calm the legitimate worries of his critics, I argue that each of these three families of objections can be answered satisfactorily. Many of the worries about relativism are misunderstandings. If a relativistic thesis claims that no one person’s or culture’s conception of virtue is rationally superior to any other’s, MacIntyre's theory can avoid this. Secondly, his notion of tradition-constituted rationality may cause frustration since it is open to interpretation (by philosophers from varying traditions) but this is not a mark against it; rather, the notion satisfyingly accounts for the paradox that there is both widespread moral disagreement *and* widespread moral agreement. Thirdly, MacIntyre's notion of teleology is credible within our modern scientific context, since all it requires is a recognition of "social teleology", which can be easily adduced by reflection on our actions and our lives. Furthermore, if some modern theories (such as Kantian deontology) are teleological, then they are in fundamental harmony with MacIntyre's theory. But consequentialism is not properly teleological if it views all relations between actions and consequences as contingent.

**Section 4: Conclusion**. Section 4 reviews the terrain covered and cleans up a few remaining points. First, I shall close this chapter with a reflection on why some critics don't just disagree but are infruriated by MacIntyre’s philosophical ethics. I shall argue that we should expect any “answer” to such fundamental worries to expose deep metaphilosophical fault lines. I shall caution MacIntyre’s allies and enemies to be cautious about hastily labeling each other as “unphilosophical” on the basis of an inability — at the moment — of finally adjudicating these disputes. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


## Rational Virtue in Practice

I can now present MacIntyre's account of virtue. First, I shall reflect on his initial definition of virtue, which is derived from a careful study of the history of the concept within the broader western tradition. Secondly, I explore the expanding definition in light of supporting concepts: *practices* are social activities in which virtues are acquired and used; The *self* is what acquires virtues and vices; *telos* is necessary to define the contrast with the way we are now and the way we ought to be if we were fully "realized" or fulfilled as persons; *practical rationality* is the defining feature of humans as dependent animals; similiarly, *phronesis* or practical wisdom bears a special relationship to all the other virtues. This complete account of virtue and practical rationality, I think, powerfully captures the phenomena of human life, and so lends support to MacIntyre’s conviction that humans are "dependent rational animals" who "need the virtues.”[@macintyre1999dependent] 

### An initial definition of virtue

MacIntyre's first definition of virtue is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191]  A few initial comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. First, virtues are acquired *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals. Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (e.g., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. MacIntyre's later  *Dependent Rational Animals* retracts the assumed divide between human and non-human animals. I revisit that retraction below. 

Secondly, virtues are *acquired* human qualities. In the first line of Plato's *Meno*, Meno asks Socrates a question that moral philosophers have continued to try to answer for the last 2,400 years. He asks "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is *acquired.* This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. In this, he agrees with Aristotle that virtue is *in accordance with* nature but not *by nature*. That is, we might say, virtues do not arise "automatically" but also are not acquired by working against the grain of our human nature. Rather, they can be seen as a "normal" psychological outgrowth of cultivating excellence within particular human practices. 

Thirdly, virtues enable their possessor to achieve particular *goods.* This point assumes that virtues are beneficial. A virtuous trait *cannot* be directed at achieving ills. This assumption will bring some trouble for MacIntyre's initial definition in *After Virtue*. Can't overall wicked people have particular virtues? Can't the thief be courageous, the dictator magnanimous, the glutton affable? It certainly seems that the answer is yes. I shall discuss this point a bit more in discussing *phronesis*. 

A second implicit point is that virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally. A grave misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both instrumental (to the achievement of certain goods) and also *partly constitutive of those goods.* Virtues are both means to an end and also ends in themselves. *Phronesis* or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in human flourishing but having *phronesis* *just is part of the definition* of flourishing. Now, this conflation of means/ends is liable to worry some critics. The worry exposes important fault lines. For the sake of completing my presentation of virtue, I must set it aside until the discussion of teleology below.  

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference goods internal to *practices*. Practice is a key term of art within MacIntyre's theory of virtue. To misunderstand 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So with these initial comments in hand, I shall more deeply explore MacIntyre's unfolding account of virtue in the following sub-sections. Each section will elaborate on one of the following interlocking components: practice, self, *telos*, human nature, tradition-constituted rationality, and *phronesis* or practical wisdom.

MacIntyre's entire philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and works through the implicit or explicit definitions of virtue in Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragic poets, the New Testament, Aquinas, Jane Austen, and Benjamin Franklin. From this historical study, he abstracts an account that is historical but not restricted to history; it aims to be universal but does not pretend to be purely abstract. His concept of virtue is, rather, *traditional*. 

### Practice ###

What is a practice? A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends. (We commonly speak of "practicing" medicine in this sense.) Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, and political activity as examples *inter alia*. A practice is not merely a reflexive action (like scratching an itch) nor merely a single, discrete, intelligible action (like pulling a weed); it is an intelligible set of actions such as tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc., all embedded within a social context and organized around a particular goal. 

For example, farming is a social activity undertaken (let's say) for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

Leading MacIntyre scholar, Christopher Lutz, analyzes MacIntyre’s famous passage into the following four aspects. A practice is: 

&gt;[1] a complex social activity that [2] enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. [3] Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, [3] the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.[@lutz2015] 

As this explication makes clear, practices are inherently *social*; they are *teleological* in that they have settled aims; they are necessarily have a *history* and social context that is being "extended" across generations. 

Lutz also makes clear that MacIntyre’s notion of virtue and practice is tied to the goods “internal to” practices. MacIntyre later refashions the contrast between 'internal' and 'externa' goods into one between 'goods of excellence' and 'goods of effectiveness.'' The point is, I think, clear. The goods of excellence in farming are just those that *necessarily constitute success within a given practice as such*: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers aim to produce comestibles, but I am generalizing.) Virtues are needed for the goods of excellence, which might include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, excellence in farming is unachievable. 

The internal goal of farming is (by my hypothesis) the production of edible food; its practitioners *as farmers* are committed to this goal without any eye toward broader features of farming as a business. The practice of farming demands specific virtues. A farmer must be honest in order to maintain positive relationships with various suppliers and buyers; a farmer must be courageous, willing to withstand real pain and risk possible harm for the sake of the good being pursued, in order to face unseasonable weather, illness, or other misfortune. 

By contrast, goods of effectiveness are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Mere efficiency in attaining such external goods does not entail the presence of a virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just a neutral desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

An illustrative example is political activity. People are motivated to undertake political activity by both excellence and mere effectiveness. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the survival, security, and prosperity of the *polis*. But a sadly large proportion of others engage in order merely to satisfy their own ambition or achieve fame. Often we see American politicians running for office only one apparent aim: book sales. 

As I see it, virtue defined by practice can already be significantly contrasted against mere *happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. On the one hand, the standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal formal laws. They are “contentful,” immanent, flexible standards. On the other hand, the standards by which practitioners judge each other are not all “external” ; they are not merely an arbitrary set of social conventions. Farmers cannot get together and decide farming is no longer about husbandry but is about selling land along highways for billboard advertisements. The practice itself, with its history and its aims, has a structure that is persists across generations and flexes, but does not break, with varying standards. That structure is passed along, modified, but modified according to an inner logic. 

Many have agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe’s characterization of consequentialism more generally that it views all consequences merely contingent goods. Such a view reduces all goods (except happiness itself) as goods of effectiveness. She puts the point in this way: 

&gt;Now the consequentialist has no footing on which to say "This would be permissible, this not"; because by his own hypothesis, it is the consequences that are to decide, and he has no business to pretend that he can lay it down what possible twists a man could give doing this or that; the most he can say is: a man must not bring about this or that; he has no right to say he will, in an actual case, bring about such-and-such unless he does so-and-so.[@anscombe1958 13] 

I shall return to this discussion of such contingent goods in the discussion of teleology below.

### Self ###

MacIntyre's account of virtue begins in terms of practices. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. A second layer of his account in *After Virtue* defines virtues as those qualities that benefit human beings in the quest of human life.[@macintyre1984after chapter 15.] Humans perform practices; humans are the bearers of virtues and vices. But what is a human self?

The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as Rawls) conceive the self as the "empty self."


or Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls), the self is not naturally constrained by inherent teleology or inherent sociality. Such thinkers celebrate the empty self. The elimination of these strictures seem an increase in freedom. In the modernist picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. My present self is a time slice of my overall total self (through time), I am able to know facts and value values, I have my own good separate and apart from your good and that of my family and community and society.  

The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating. John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast well enough to quote them in full:

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a *telos*, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific *telos* brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a *telos* external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 


But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. On this issue, MacIntyre argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self.  While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a two comments are worth making to clarify and help to justify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map. The first is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There are no Tarzans or Mowglis raised outside of a particular culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

The second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of  slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. But it seems that each of us takes an identity, at least in part, from our past and from our tradition. 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of *telos*, restored to its proper place. In the traditional picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. In the present, I owe my being and personhood to the past (especially my family who biologically gave me being) and psychologically and culturally to my tradition. I am able to know truth, for there is only one manifold of truths. My good is that of my community; my community’s good is that of mine. These data are fundamental. 

### *Telos* ### 

In the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”, the *Nicomachean Ethics*, MacIntyre finds the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific *telos*. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that *telos*.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The *telos* of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

For MacIntyre, the loss of *telos* (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But *telos* unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. 

It is difficult to understate the importance of this point about the self and its relation to not only virtue theory but ethical theory itself. Edward Oakes describes the removal of *telos* from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”

&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed...Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. For instance, MacIntyre denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture. Instead, MacIntyre's provisional conception of our human *telos* is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. MacIntyre is not a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human *telos* is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. He concludes that the human *telos* (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the *telos* might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in. The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate *telos* of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. 







I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 



Thus far, we have seen that MacIntyre presents virtues as those qualities acquired by individual selves in the performance of practices that serve the intrinsic *teloi* or ends of those practices. 

### An initial worry 

Thus far, MacIntyre has argued that the modern conception of morality and the attendant conception of the self are fatally flawed; the restoration of virtue requires a restoration of human *telos* as the goal of life, and attention to practices by in which we develop virtues. One worry that many readers have shared is that MacIntyre’s account of virtue, thus far, is simply too relativistic: Is torture a “practice”? Or is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? MacIntyre admits in *After Virtue* that there *might* be evil practices. 

Furthermore, Martha Nussbaum and others worry that MacIntyre is simply defending hidebound conservatism. We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil.) If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. MacIntyre's earlier theory cannot overcome this objection, Lutz argues. He says:

&gt;Unfortunately, the relativism of *After Virtue* cannot be overcome unless its definitions of the virtues are extended to embrace the Aristotelian and Thomistic doctrine of the unity of virtue. MacIntyre's rejection of the unity of virtue in *After Virtue* has grave implications for the rest of his virtue theory because the rejection of the unity of virtue divorces the intellectual moral virtue of prudence from the passional moral virtues of courage, temperence, and justice... Prudence becomes cleverness...The strength of MacIntyre's account of practices is that the pursuit of excellence in a practice entails the pursuit of virtue, but if practices can be evil, and virtues can 'enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to' such an evil practice, and virtues can be anything at all.[@lutz2004tradition 98-101]

Lutz continues by examining the implications of divorcing intellectual and moral virtues: (1) "It constitues the rejection of the Aristotelian practical syllogism that MacIntyre wanted to recover in *After Virtue* because it separates prudent reasoning from virtuous action. (2) It evacuates all falsifiable substantive moral content from the virtues, reducing them to enabling qualities."[@lutz2004tradition 100] 

There have been ethical philosophers who endorse this kind of reductive virtue: Lutz mentions Edmund Pincoff.[@pincoffs1971quandary]  But the commonsense definition of "virtue" includes *goodness*. A virtue is, within our tradition, a quality *admirable for its own sake* or else a quality that enables its bearer to *achieve admirable goals*. 

For all that, MacIntyre vehemently denies being a relativist. 

He devotes the whole of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* to capturing the truth in *relativity* while escaping relativism. To avoid relativism, he must say something to do justice to the assumption that virtues are not neutral with respect to ends, but are actually *good* for their possessor. He must put practice into a broader teleological context and question whether life *as a whole* can be virtuous. He does say that the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] Integrity is not our *telos*, but it is a necessary condition. Even putting human life into a unified, narrative context does not ultimately solve the problem of relativism. For we still might worry: is there a single *telos* for human life? Is there a unity to all the virtues such that “wicked virtues” can be excluded? And if so, is it rooted in our “metaphysical biology” as Aristotle thought? 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third layer in the *After Virtue* account: practical rationality. 

### A second worry ###

We must beware a misunderstanding. Any talk of “returning” to virtue is liable to sound nostalgic. Martha Nussbaum is one of many who have fallen to this misunderstanding.[@nussbaum1989recoiling] She begins her review of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* with an age-old dilemma between the social stability afforded by tradition (with its danger of hidebound error) and the social volatility endemic to critical reflection (with its opportunity of progress toward truth). She alludes to this dilemma as articulated by Aristotle: 

&gt;In the second book of the Politics, Aristotle asks whether it is a good thing to encourage changes in society. Should people be offered rewards for inventing some change in the traditional laws? No, he writes, because this would lead to instability and unnecessary tampering with what is working well. Should we, on the other hand, listen to those who wish to keep ancestral traditions fixed and immune from criticism? No again—for if we reason well we can make progress in lawmaking, just as we do in other arts and sciences.[@nussbaum1989recoiling]

Aristotle’s solution is that it should be hard but not impossible to change societal structures. Of course, we don’t have to pick just one or the other. But, putting it starkly, of the two it is better to risk instability (and gamble for progressing toward truth) than to risk hidebound error (and gamble for stability). 

Strangely, Nussbaum takes MacIntyre to be reversing Aristotle’s balance. She thinks MacIntyre is urging for betting on social stability even if it means sticking closer to existing tradition (and hence surpassing or intentionally avoiding critical reflection) than is compatible with unfettered progress.

This is not an objection to MacIntyre — it is a misreading. MacIntyre's proposed solution is not a sort of *anti-progressive* longing for the past. It is radically progressive. He rejected fideism and conservatism. His solution is not to reverse progress but to abandon the standard of progress set up in the Enlightenment and to continue under an alternative standard of progress. 

At the risk of sounding paradoxical, we might put it this way: MacIntyre's positive ethical positions are *traditional* but not *nostalgic.* In fact, his definition of tradition as an ongoing, socially-embedded argument over time entails necessarily that moral enquiry is dynamic, progressive, and even *modern*. For, to be traditional is not to be past-oriented; to be traditional is to be staunchly future-oriented, since the business of life is not only the pursuit of our telos but the transmission of everything valuable and precious to the next generation. 

### Human nature as practical reasonors

*Dependent Rational Animals* is, in part, a response to the lingering worries about relativism that plague MacIntyre's theory. His answer to this worry is, I believe, the crux of his whole theory of ethics. It appeals to two concepts that are, for him, intimately bound up with each other. The two concepts are practical reason and human nature. Rational animals is *what we are*. If we cannot escape our identity as animals who are (potentially) practically rational, then we cannot escape our need for certain virtues. Furthermore, some activities will militate against our growing up to become fully practical rationality; these are vices. 

This connection highlights what an important truth that Weinstein observes: the primary theme of MacIntyre's work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre 60] MacIntyre defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but the whole domain of *living well*. *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethics as a species of practical rationality. 

The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally significant as our independence, autonomy, or self-sufficiency. In other words, there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate the commonalities between us and other animals. He says: 

&gt;I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

The point, I take it, is that we are practical reasoners. Imagine any scenario of humans gathering and doing what comes naturally, and it will involve group deliberation about what to do: High school students debating about where to sit at lunch; couples arguing over the budget; political leaders proposing new laws; philosophy department meetings making hiring and admissions decisions. The pattern is this: groups of humans engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is impossible (for fully functioning adults) to live life even for a full day without engaging in such reasoning. 

A second point is that human life is not one continuous phase of adulthood; it begins with youth and ends with old age. Regarding point (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says:  

&gt;Virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities that are specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how and why they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9] Not only individual human beings, but entire communities, institutions, and nations need virtues to keep their integrity and to produce the next generation of independent, virtuous, rational animals.

// Transition

How do the arguments of *After Virtue* connect to these points? We may fairly draw this connection: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and the virtues that enable them must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

Whatever definition of virtue we settle on will generate a “list” of virtues. Whatever virtues are included on the list had better not exclude virtues that make human life possible; it had better not exclude (as Aristotle did) women and manual workers from the very possibility of developing virtues. 

We can see how the structural limits on what it means to be human begin to set boundaries on our ethical theories. Empirical study cannot tell us what is good, but it can set limits on *what is not* going to be good for creatures like us. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] But our practical reasoning sets us apart in some respects. We have the burden and responsibility to set the course for our own lives, and to care for the dependent among us who are not yet practical reasoners or who are no longer such. 

The practice of practical reasoning is a common human practice. This makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. Vices harm the dependent and restrict them from becoming independent practical reasoners. 

// This also illuminates why the differences between humans and lower animals is less important than MacIntyre initially assumed. Animals cannot practically reason in quite as sophisticated ways as we can. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality ###

Practical rationality, while it is "human", only takes place within human contexts -- traditions. As MacIntyre says, "We, whoever we are, can only begin enquiry from the vantage point afforded by our relationship to some specific social and intellectual past through which we have affiliated ourselves to some particular tradition of enquiry, extending the history of that enquiry into the present ...”[@macintyre1988whose 401] The tradition of enquiry we inhabit gives us not only abstract standards of reasoning but also facts, connections, concepts, and the very language we speak. Rationality, for MacIntyre, is inclusive of all the resources by which we judge true and false. Rationality itself as tradition-constituted and tradition-constituting. The resources I receive from my tradition are resources I may prune, discard, modify, or add to. 

The means we have of "switching" traditions are first, to identify the inadequacies of our primary tradition; and secondly, to explore via philosophical imagination the resources of a rival tradition. We must empathetically engage with our rivals as if we are learning a "second first language." He says: 

&gt;For each of us, therefore, the question now is: To what issues does that particular history bring us in contemporary debate? What resources does our particular tradition afford in this situation? Can we by means of those resources understand the achievements and successes, and the failures and sterilities, of rival traditions more adequately than their own adherents can? More adequately by our own standards? More adequately also by theirs? It is insofar as the histories narrated in this book lead on to answers to these questions that they also hold promise of answering the questions: Whose justice? Which rationality?”[@macintyre1988whose 402]

By presenting rationality and tradition as almost the same concept, MacIntyre both elevates the concept of tradition and threatens the concept of rationality. Since traditions vary, is there any way to avoid the conclusion that rationalities vary -- and incommensurably so? 

### Practical wisdom ###

To answer this, we need to consider *excellence* in practical reasoning. Our human nature as dependent practical reasoners clarifies why prudence or *phronesis* is the master virtue and also helps to shore up his virtue theory against the accusation that it is relativistic. *Phronesis* complements and completes every other moral virtue. MacIntyre defends Aristotle’s conception of the practical syllogism wherein the major premise is an evaluative judgment about a virtue or action-type; the minor premise is a truth judgment about a situation or action-token; the conclusion is *an action*. For example, “I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting a student’s attempt to bribe me for a higher grade. This student is attempting to bribe me for a higher grade. Therefore, in this case, I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting this student’s attempt to bribe me.” Without moral virtues, prudence is simply the knowledge of *what is to be done*. Without prudence, the moral virtues are simply skills or habits that might be serviceable to bad ends; one might be excellent in achieving *what is not be done*. 

The mastery of prudence over other virtues also unifies the other virtues. *Dependent Rational Animals* advances MacIntyre’s virtue theory in that it supplies a basis for the unity of intellectual and moral virtues, for the unity of the various moral virtues, and for unity of the various stages of the narrative of *human* life. The paradoxical notion of “wicked virtues” are explained only with this broad context of human life, and with this definition of human nature. 

Although these responses to the initial worry about relativism may bring up more questions than they answer, they at least present a coherent picture of human life and the qualities needed to live it well. 

### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

In short, MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

For MacIntyre, moral enquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such enquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. 

## Objections 

MacIntyre’s work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. He is a traditionalist and so has come in for criticism from his fellow Aristotelians or Thomists such as Robert P. George and John Haldane on the fine points of the tradition. I shall not dig deeply into these worries; it seems to me a higher priority to persuade more philosophers of the main points of the tradition.  A second group are MacIntyre's “genealogists.” Some are postmodernists or continental philosophers. Such readers tend to agree with MacIntyre's critique of modernity but reject his rather optimistic alternative. They agree that our choice is between “Nietzsche or Aristotle” -- but they reject Aristotle.[@hill1992macintyre; @korkut2012macintyre] This chapter is not the place to host a debate between the Nietszchean school and the Aristotelian school. Yet it seems a bit cheap to stipulate that Nietzscheanism is false and move on. Perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Perhaps all moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense is simply a mask for the Will to Power. Philippa Foot, at least, has argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Suffice it to say that I have not yet been persuaded by the "masters of suspicion." The third group of critics belong to the tradition of modernity. These mostly analytic modern philosophers are MacIntyre's “encyclopedists.” Such readers (including Martha Nussbaum and Thomas Nagel) find MacIntyre’s diagnosis misguided and so find his solutions needless and radical. They deny that our choice is between *either* “Nietzsche *or* Aristotle." They rather defend some one or other modern moral philosophy, such as deontology, consequentialism, contractarianism, egoism, sentimentalism, or something else. This third group is my primary audience. It will be impossible here to mention let alone do justice to MacIntyre's sizable crowd of interlocutors. Instead, in the following sub-sections, I shall articulate three families of objections about relativism, tradition-constituted rationality, and teleology that seem to me to make the most trouble for MacIntyre's account of virtue. 

### Relativism objections

The most recurring objection is that MacIntyre's virtue theory is viciously relativistic. This weighty objection deserves almost a whole chapter in its own right.  Generally, how do we make sense of these worries? The constellation of (sometimes conflicting) positions that fly under heading of 'relativism' is no small task. Richard Rorty gives one representative expression: relativism is the claim that "there is nothing to be said about either truth or rationality apart from descriptions of the familiar procedures of justification which a given society—ours—uses in one or another area of inquiry."[@rorty1991objectivity] 

Instead of attempting to sift through the enormous literature on relativism, I shall here follow Stephn Lutz's stipulation: "'Relativism' is a thesis about the conclusion of enquiries; every would-be knower wants truth, but is limited by its contingent, historical conditions and/or the perspective of the enquirer. Hence no conclusion is *true* in the sense the enquirer wanted."[@lutz2004tradition 66] In other words, to the relativist, the knower's (individual or cultural) perspective is both starting point and the ending point of any enquiry. 

Now, it is undeniable that in MacIntyre's account virtue is relative to rival traditions of moral inquiry with their conflicting communities and practices. So has he only provided a cultural anthropology of virtue and not a theory of virtue? Is there any way to rationally adjudicate moral conflict? 

There are a variety of ways to specify this worry. For example, Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] Thankfully, not all of these demand equal attention: some are simply misunderstandings, while others are legitimate calls for clarification. I shall quickly summarize how Lutz answers these misunderstandings and clarifications. The other objections that put real pressure on the limits of MacIntyre’s theory I shall address in the next section. 

### Five misguided criticisms ###

The first criticism is that of Susan Feldman.[@feldman1986objectivity] Feldman misinterprets MacIntyre’s project as a failed and incoherent attempt to resolve factious, subjective ethical disputes by judging them from an abstract, objective, ideal observer. But MacIntyre never explicitly presents his theory as an ideal observer theory; rather, he explicitly denies it. The ideal observer would have to *begin* the enquiry from the view from nowhere, which is impossible for us. MacIntyre just is not building -- not even *attempting* to build -- a procedural meta-ethics with which to adjudicate otherwise intractable normative disagreements. 

The second is from Robet Wachbroit. MacIntyre himself responded to Wachbroit in the second edition of *After Virtue*.[@wachbroit1984relativism] Wachbroit's worry is about the fundamental plurality of rationalities. He thinks MacIntyre faces a dilemma. Either MacIntyre himself writes from the view from nowhere, the Enlightenment objectivity, the archimedean point, or he writes from within the Aristotelian tradition. MacIntyre seems to get caught in this dilemma in sentences like these: "It scarcely needs repeating that it is the central thesis of *After Virtue* that the Aristotelian moral tradition is the best example we possess of a tradition whose adherents are entitled to a high measure of confidence in its epistemological and moral resources."[@macintyre1984after 277] To whom does that 'we' refer? The dilemma, again, is that either 'we' are the Enlightened modern liberals or 'we' are the dyed-in-the-wool Aristotelians. On the first horn, if he writes from the view-from-nowhere, then MacIntyre is simply a modern meta-ethicist writing modern meta-ethics. He is criticizing liberalism from within the liberal tradition; he is borrowing the resources of the liberal definition of rationality to posit a theory in which no one definition of rationality has the resources to write books like *After Virtue*. On the second horn, if 'we' are card-carrying Aristotelians, it is trivial and almost tautologous to assert that 'we' take a high measure of confidence in Aristotelianism's epistemological and moral resources. Of course 'we' do! That kind of heady confidence that 'we' are up to standards arises within *each* tradition according to *that* tradition's own standards. 

But Wachbroit misunderstands MacIntyre's theory ever so slightly here. MacIntyre can run through the horns of the dilemma. The 'we' need not be an ideal observer from a God's-eye point of view nor an Aristotelian already subsumed in the Aristotelian tradition. The 'we' can be those of us within broader western culture who have faced or might face the same kind of epistemological crisis that lead MacIntyre (and others) to critically evaluate the present state of western culture. The adherent of liberalism and the adherent of Aristotelianism share a common social, historical, and traditional root. Without too much difficulty, they can learn each other's conceptual vocabulary as a 'second language'. By self-reflecting upon the Enlightenment "branch" of the broader western tradition, and by facing up to its inadequacies and epistemological inconsistencies, the liberal adherent can test for him or herself whether the Aristotelian tradition has more resources for solving problems that are problems *by liberalism's own lights*. If, as MacIntyre did, such a person discovers that the Aristotelian has more resources for solving those problems, he or she might make rejoin with that older but no less thriving tradition. 

The third criticism is this: Mark Colby misunderstands MacIntyre's project as an attempt to develop a new, objective criterion of truth that will solve the problem of epistemological crisis, regardless of one's tradition. On Colby's reading, MacIntyre is a kind of pragmatist, where the truth is just the conclusion of a certain sort of rational enquiry. But MacIntyre denies this. The test of a traditon's rationality is its adequation to reality. Lutz illustrates this with the example of astronomy. 

&gt; Ptolemaic astronomy lasted 1000 years because it solves a set of astronomical problems better than any of its opponents, including the heliocentric models of Aristarchus and Copernicus. Nevertheless, it did not adequately characterize the true nature of planetary motion and so under close evaluation it was plagued by inefficiencies that lead its adherents into a epistemological crisis. The theory that overcame Ptolemaic astronomy did so because it solved the astronomical problems or adequately than the Ptolemaic model, and it was confirmed by its predictive capacity. The fact that Kepler's astronomical model once subsumed into Newtonian physics, could predict novel facts provided confirmation that it was not only a clever description of a puzzling phenomenon, but a more adequate characterization of its object: the true nature of planetary motion.
&gt; what counts as progressiveness in the epistemological crisis resolution is improved adequacy to truths, but it pissed him logical crises only rise *within* traditions. Ptolemaic astronomers overcame *their* epistemological crisis when they abandoned *their own* geocentric beliefs Intertraditional considerations arise only when the adherents of one tradition are able to recongize in the resources of another tradition a more adequate solution to their own epistemological crisis. So progressiveness in epistemological crisis resolution cannot function as an intertraditional norm of rationality. This is no challenge to MacIntyre, however, because MacIntyre does not envision epistemological crisis as a tool for comparative ethics or meta-ethics.[@lutz2004tradition 91]

As I understand Lutz' point here, Colby is conflating the attempt of an enquirer *within* a tradition to resolve his or her epistemological crisis through examining the resources of a rival tradition with the attempt of an inquirier *outside* both traditions to resolve "epistemological crisis" per se by developing an intertraditional or trans-traditional criterion of adequacy. MacIntyre thinks the former is possible (and happens often) but that the latter is impossible. 

Alicia Juarrero Roque surfaces a fourth possible misinterpretation. MacIntyre claims that "comparison" between traditions is possible for an enquirer. But it is not possible by the attainment of an objective, context-free stance. Rather, each inquirier acquires a conceptual framework from his own tradition -- this is like a "first language." But each enquirer has the capacity to learn a "second first language". We can learn another conceptual framework philosophical imagination, through taking it *as if true* even before affirming it *as true*. Why do this? Usually because the enquirer's own tradition has failed him; he sees its inadequacies, he sees its problems and contradictions, he sees that it fails to live up to its own standards. MacIntyre describes what "rare gift of empathy"[@macintyre1988whose 167] that this "philosophical imagination" makes possible: “…understand the theses, arguments, and concepts of their rival in such a way that they are able to view themselves from such an alien standpoint and to re-characterize their own beliefs in an appropriate manner from the alien perspective."[@macintyre1988whose 167] Roque's worry is that the capacity for learning a second first language is an innate, rational capacity that *all people share.* If so, then belief in such a capacity contradicts the definition of tradition-constituted rationality. If not, then the absence of such a capacity renders tradition comparison impossible. MacIntyre's response is flatly to deny this interpretation of his work. The "capacity" to learn another tradition as a "second first language" is a "rare gift of empathy" and in no way part of a supposed bundle of innate capacities. This rebuttal does not make such a capacity unproblematic; we still might wonder whether, for an given enquirer, that enquirer's estimation that he possesses the gift of empathy and philosophical imagination isn't just a re-statement of the trivial thought, "I think I am right."

These four criticisms arise from a worry about relativism but the worry is ultimately unjustified. Below, I shall respond more fully to a few more versions of this worry.

### Tradition-constituted rationality objections ###

The second and related objection is that his theory of tradition-constituted rationality is incoherent, unhelpfully vague, or perhaps incompatible with the very act of writing a book like *After Virtue*. The worries about relativism can be answered by an appeal to practical rationality. But for MacIntyre, practical rationality is tradition-consituted. So at least some worries about relativism reappear at this second order. For this reason, Stephen Lutz's last "relativism" objection I treat as a “tradition-constituted rationality" objection.

The objection is threefold: is MacIntyre’s concept of tradition-constituted rationality even coherent? Suppose some traditions are truly incommensurable to each other, and that MacIntyre himself is truly situated within a tradition. It follows it is not possible to write a book (like *After Virtue*?) from a universal, objective, view-from-nowhere. But MacIntyre wrote such books and defending such theories. This amounts to a performative contradiction. 

Even if his concept is coherent,  is it *clear* enough to be an indispensable feature of an ethical theory? What constitutes a tradition? MacIntyre's examples sometimes lead us to believe that a tradition can be anything from a religion (Judaism) to a discipline (like moral inquiry) to a philosophical school (like Thomism). 

Once the concept of tradition is clarified, how can MacIntyre avoid the charge of relativism at this level? According to MacIntyre's account, members of traditions can leave their primary tradition after undergoing an epistemological crisis. Remember that varying traditions can disagree about a proposition P. Perhaps tradition A finds P true and B finds it false, on best evidence and sufficient reflection. But incommensurable traditions disagree about the standards (say, S1 and S2) by which to judge the truth and even the rationality of other traditions. So A finds P true and rational (by S1) while B finds P false and irrational (by S2). They genuinely disagree. And A judges B to be irrational (since they deny that P) while B returns the favor (since A affirms that P). 

Let's put these abstractions into an example. Consider Annabelle. Annabelle is member of tradition A. Suppose that by A's standards of rationality, S1 contradictory propositions cannot both be true in the same sense. And suppose that A teaches that P. Finally, suppose that P entails both (Q and ~Q). Annabelle discovers a problem with her tradition. She cannot deny P nor can she affirm the contradiction. After some searching about, she concludes she cannot solve the problem and cannot even discover the rational resources with which to solve them. Being passingly familiar with tradition B, she becomes curious why her friends who belong to that tradition deny P and exercises her philosophical imagination to begin to see B "from within." Tradition B is compelling, since it denies that P. She "converts" traditions. However, there is a problem with tradition B, and that is that the standard of rationality of B (S2) allows its adherents to affirm a contradiction. So now, even though Annabelle left A to avoid having to affirm a contradiction (by her standard of rationality S1) now that she has joined B she no longer sees it as irrational to affirm the contradiction (by her new standard of rationality S2). This is surely an odd conclusion. 

A second variation on the same problem is this: how would a born-and-raised member of tradition B, affirming S2, ever come to epistemological crisis? Discontentment with contradictions is not available to B members *ex hypothesi*. They do not see affirming a contradiction as irrational. Their tradition can bear a hundred instances of (Q and ~Q).

The odd conclusion of this thought experiment is a dilemma: either such nonsense is possible, or embracing the law of non-contradiction is a universal standard of rationality in every tradition. The latter option seems to indicate that traditions A and B are *not* actually incommensurable, since they share one rather substantial presupposition. The flow of members from one to the other is intelligible. The former option allows A and B to be incommensurable, but seems to freeze members in their own tradition. Members of A would have no (rational) justification for joining B, while members of B would have no (rational) justification for leaving B. So either all traditions are the same (in which case MacIntyre's definition is unclear) or some people are in principle locked in their own tradition (in which case one kind of relativism is final). 

While "tradition" and "tradition-constituted rationality" were supposed to solve the conundrums MacIntyre faced in his life and philosophical career, the cure may have been worse than the disease. 

### *Telos* objections###

The third and final major objection I shall consider pertains to teleology. This constellation of objections is powerful. Yet in addition to the real philosophical difficulty of the matter, the prejudices and misconceptions surrounding teleology are so thick I shall need more than the sections in this chapter to fully respond to it. I think an adequate response can, ultimately, be made. It will take some philosophical digging around in the structural foundations of our thinking to make progress.  

In this section I shall present three objections from teleology that are especially problematic for MacIntyre's narrative. 

The first is to deny MacIntyre's narrative. MacIntyre has it that modern moral philosophy surgically excised *telos* from natural science, psychology, and ethics. But perhaps modern moral philosophy is not so anti-teleological as all that. Kant's categorical imperative, much vaunted for its austere duty for the sake of duty, is actually aimed at perfection.[@ward1971kant] Keith Ward argued with some impatience almost 40 years ago (10 years before *After Virtue*'s first edition) that Kant should not be interpreted as commending duty as some abstract, context-free obligation. He says: 

&gt;Kant's position is not merely that one must conceive oneself as setting up a purposive order of Nature, according to universal laws, as though one could arbitrarily choose anything whatsoever as one's purpose. One can see this if one takes Kant's list of examples of moral duties in the *Metaphysic of Morals* [sic]. Masturbation is against the *purposes of Nature*, in forming the sexual organs; suicide contravenes *Nature's purpose* in establishing self-love in order to preserve life... Finally, "holiness of will" must be pursued, as this expresses the absolute worth of the human person, in its freedom from sensuous impulses and its transcendence of Nature.[@ward1971kant 341] 

Likewise, it seems that consequentialism is teleological in a plausible sense of *telos*. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). So perhaps virtue ethics can be synthesized with consequentialism. 

Furthermore, Cummiskey has argued that Kant can be understood as a consequentialist of sorts.[@cummiskey1996kantian] The proposal is that Kant's *justification* for moral normative principles was a brute, formal, categorical imperative, but the *content* of such normative principles included agents and the goods they aim to attain. Happiness can be valued as an imperfect duty, though rational agency must be valued as a perfect duty. Without entering into all the interesting details at this juncture, the thought is that perhaps a (thoroughly modern) moral philosophy like deontology can be synthesized with natural teleology. 

A second form of this objection about teleology is that ethics can get along well enough without intrinsic *teloi*. We cannot accept natural teleology since this notion has been exorcised from natural science (and from all rational philosophy) by Darwin and Newton. Thankfully, morality can function without it. The moral law *by itself* guides or forms our actions without a natural *telos* performing that function. For example, Christine Korsgaard's "Authority of Reflection"[@korsgaard1996authority] builds a case that human autonomy -- the ability to be a law to oneself -- is the source of normative authority. How does this work? My own identity as a human being obligates me to behave morally. She argues that "autonomy is the source of obligation" and that "we have *moral* obligations... to humanity as such."[@korsgaard1996authority 93] Because I am self-reflective, I am accountable for what I do. Also because I am self-reflective, I have a self-conception. She says the "thinking self" regulates the "acting self." Korsgaard's notion of practical identity is that we assume identities such as human being, child, parent, teacher, etc. Each identity is functional; it grounds obligations. If I am really to be a teacher, I must show up for class. If I really am to be a parent, I must feed and educate my child. Practical identities may be more or less contingent. All of us are children; not all of us educators. At least one practical identity is necessary. That is our practical identity *as humans*. Humans "need to have practical conceptions of our identity in order to act and live."[@korsgaard1996authority 106] The fact is, we do act and live. Therefore we do have a moral identity. Put another way, she says: “Rational action is possible only if human beings find their own humanity to be valuable.”[@korsgaard1996authority 106] The moral identity is one in which I take up a viewpoint as a member of the "Kingdom of Ends", the community of those who also have a moral identity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 

The point of these objections is to push back on MacIntyre's narrative in which our modern liberal tradition excised *telos*. Either we did not do so, or (even if we did) we could get along without it. 

These three objections -- about relativism, tradition-constituted rationality, and teleology -- are some of the most telling against MacIntyre's theory. In the discussion section I shall attempt to answer each one. 

## Discussion

Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted at being considered a giant in Lilliput but a midget in Brobdingnag;[@swift1965gulliver Part I, chapter 2 and Part II, chapter 1] the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is criticised for excessive rationalism by his co-religionists[@milbank2008theology] and for excessive religiosity by rationalists[@nussbaum1989recoiling]; he too progressive for traditionalists and too traditional for progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. To quote Swift: "Philosophers are in the right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise than by Comparison." 

### Reply to relativism 1 -- relative rationality, absolute truth

MacIntyre's denial of relativism boils down to two points: the first is that even situated enquiry can achieve truth. He accepts -- indeed, argues for -- a certain truth within relativism. That truth is that every enquirer seeks the conclusion of the enquiry at a particular time and place, within a particular social setting, within a language, and within a tradition. Following Lutz, we can say that MacIntyre accepts “relativity”. Relativity (a term borrowed from Michael Krausz[@krausz1984relativism]) is a thesis about *the condition of enquiry.* It is not a thesis about the *conclusion of enquiry.* Lutz approves of Mark Colby's statement that "argumentative situatedness is inescapable."[@lutz2004tradition 89] However such relative situatedness is compatible with objective or absolute or mind-independent or tradition-independent *truth*. 

Returning to Rorty's claim, we can say that MacIntyre agrees that "nothing can be said about... rationality" except what is taken as rational in a given society and tradition; where he disagrees is in equating rationality with *truth.* From the historically- and socially-situated position of enquiry, a philosopher (he argues) may indeed find truth. It is impossible to achieve objective or absolute or tradition-independent *rationality* but it is possible -- indeed, it is the hope and *telos* of enquiry -- to achieve objective *truth.* This may seem a paradox. 

The primary kind of truth we seek in enquiry is "the adequation of the mind to reality."[@aquinas Q.16 and *De Veritate* Q.1, A.1-3. "Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus."] This is the understanding of truth inherent in the Aristotelian tradition.[^3]  Aristotle says, “To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true."[@aristotle *Metaphysics* 1011b25]  Aquinas calls this the adequation of the intellect to the object.

[^3]: On the correspondance theory of truth, Marian David says: "The main positive argument given by advocates of the correspondence theory of truth is its obviousness. Descartes: 'I have never had any doubts about truth, because it seems a notion so transcendentally clear that nobody can be ignorant of it...the word "truth", in the strict sense, denotes the conformity of thought with its object' (1639, AT II 597). Even philosophers whose overall views may well lead one to expect otherwise tend to agree. Kant: 'The nominal definition of truth, that it is the agreement of [a cognition] with its object, is assumed as granted' (1787, B82). William James: 'Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their "agreement", as falsity means their disagreement, with "reality"'' (1907, p. 96). Indeed, The Oxford English Dictionary tells us: "Truth, n. Conformity with fact; agreement with reality'".

However, 'truth' is ambiguous across at least two senses: a metaphysical, substantive sense and an epistemological, logical sense. (There may be a third semantic sense.) The metaphysical sense of truth is simply reality. "Truth" is being itself. The logical sense of truth (which MacIntyre alludes to here) is the adequation of the intellect to those beings. Logical "truth" is knowing the (metaphysical) truth. The third semantic sense of 'truth' would, naturally, be the accurate relation between the content of one's assertions and the beings about which one is making assertions. "Truth" is veridical statements about the (metaphysical) truth.

If we understand MacIntyre to be arguing or assuming that (logical) truth is adequation of mind to reality, we can make sense of his endorsement of "relativity". Rationality is something more pragmatic than truth, something more like "warranted assertability."[@dewey1941propositions 169] That is, the theories we rationally construct are, for us, the "best theory so far".[@macintyre1988whose] It is no contradiction or paradox to assert that our rationality is the best thus far but that others in the future (or the past, or in rival traditions) might be *closer* to the truth. 

The second point is that enquirers from within various traditions can (and often do) come to realize that their tradition is incoherent by its own standards and from this epistemological crisis come to find the resources of a rival tradition superior to their own; Aristotelian (and specifically Thomist) moral enquiry is, he argues, more rationally justified than encyclopedic or genealogical enquiry *by their standards* and *by its own standards*.  

In this way, MacIntyre escapes (one iteration) of the charge of relativism. The truth can be known from within the confines of our tradition and perspective. This answer, of course, puts pressure on his definition of "tradition." We shall return to this concern below. 

### Reply to relativism 2 - unity of virtue ###

Are there evil practices? If so, it seemed that MacIntyre's theory would allow "virtues" to serve wicked ends. The rebuttal to this charge depends on the unity of virtue. 

In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, MacIntyre explicitly retracts his earlier belief that virtues exist without a unity under prudence.[@macintyre1988whose preface, p. x] The consequences of this retraction, Lutz argues, are crucial to refuting the charge of relativism. If virtues are unified, then even though virtues exist only in the context of practices, "no genuine practice can be inherently evil."[@lutz2004tradition 102] Rather, practical reason can judge *apparent goods* as genuine goods. The qualities needed for achieving the spurious goods internal to that "practice" would not be virtues but only *apparent virtues*. Now, such a definition certainly seems ad hoc. But Lutz provides a persuasive illustration: eugenics. Eugenics certainly seems to bear the markings of a genuine practice. Its apparent good is the purification of the gene pool for future generations. However, genuine virtues militate *against* the achievement of that goal. For example, Lutz cites a story of a doctor who had the virtue of compassion found himself unable to pursue the program of euthanizing mentally-disabled children.[@poliakov1979harvest 186-7] We might also recall Huck Finn's internal struggle with his "conscience" in Twain's *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*. Huck decides to turn Jim in to the slave owners. He writes a letter outing Jim, and feels much better after "repenting" of his theft. But after vividly confronting Jim's humanity, his goodness, and their loyal friendship, he wavers. 

&gt;I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now... it was a difficult situation. I picked up the letter, and held it in my hand. I was trembling, because I knew had to make a choice between two things, and the outcome of my decision would last forever. I thought about it a minute while I held my breath. And then I said to myself: “All right, then, I’ll GO to hell"—and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said... I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t.[@twain2014adventures,Chapter 31] 

The humor of this passage arises, in large part, because of the tension between the *apparent good* of treating Jim as legal property and the *actual good* of treating Jim as an end in himself, as a free man just like any other. Huck's virtue (in this case, loyalty or friendship) *cannot* be put to use in the service of a corrupting practice like slave-trading. Just as vice subverts institutions and their worthy practices, virtue "subverts" vicious institutions and unworthy practices. Virtue marks the difference between the coward who disobeys his commanding officer's orders because the obedience would put him at risk of painful death and the courageous person who disobeys his commanding officer's order because obedience would require wrongdoing. Without prudence to discriminate between the two cases, we lack any resources by which to discriminate courage and cowardice, between a virtuous resistance and vicious resistance. 

Some might worry that the distinction between apparent goods and actual goods brings with it more problems than it solves. It is certainly a distinction that leaves many questions unanswered. My first reply is that such a distinction is inevitable and necessary in our practical reasoning. Assume for a reductio that "there is no real distinction between apparent and real goods." Then either *nothing* is "actually good" (everything that appears good is just an apparent good) or that *nothing* is "actually bad though it appears good" (everything that appears good is a real good). But I take it as axiomatic and irrefutable that some things are actually good (life, pleasure, happiness, art, stars.) And some things that appear good are not good: obeying unjust laws, eating unhealthy but delicious food, etc.  Therefore there is a real distinction between apparent and real goods. 

A second reply, however, is that the admitted indeterminacy of MacIntyre's account reflects the real indeterminacy of our moral lives. Consider two phenomena: some individuals and cultures persist in behaviors (that I believe) are wicked and unjustifiable -- slavery, child prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, or what have you. It needs to be explained, from within my tradition, how it could be that otherwise decent and normal human beings could persist in such vileness. The other phenomena is this: some individuals and cultures repent and change (what I believe are) their wicked ways. In other words, there is no magical linear moral progression from wicked to good, in history as a whole; yet, even so, some individuals cultures become more good (by my standards of goodness). How do we explain this paradoxical phenomenon? 

MacIntyre's account explains why vices sometimes persist within pseudo-practices, institutions, and traditions from generation to generation; on the other hand, it explains why practice-enabling virtues sometimes emerge to disrupt a pseudo-practice, a wicked institution, and a corrupt or at least incomplete tradition. The fact is that "many kinds of activities can be, and in fact are considered to be, practices. Some of these may conflict radically, owing to errors and insufficiences in rationlity."[@lutz2004tradition 103] Errors in rationality explain errors in traditions and hence misacriptions of the title 'virtue.' Rationality answers to truth, to the world as it is, not merely to the pragmatic  truth to "dialectical success."[@lutz2004tradition 104] Hence, virtues answer to *what is really good*. They do not merely answer to "what-counts-as-good-for-us", which property is relative to each tradition. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes this iteration of the charge of relativism, while still explaining why rival traditions differ -- and sometimes radically differ -- in their evaluations and opinions. Incomplete traditions can, and do, undergo crisis. Particular persons within that tradition discover and perseverate on inadequacies within the tradition, leading to an epistemological crisis. In response, others within the same tradition may become willing to examine the resources of rival traditions and either quit their primary tradition or re-fashion it, re-make it, update it, and make real moral and intellectual progress. 

### Closing remarks on relativism


MacIntyre has responded to (and he thinks refuted) the charge of relativism multiple times, in his primary works and in “responses to critics.” Yet for many, relativism stains the image of MacIntyre. J. L. A. Garcia says this: 

&gt;MacIntyre’s rebuttal is as radical as it is ingenious. It is, in effect, to outrelativize the relativist. Rather than recoiling from relativism, as I understand his strategy, MacIntyre plunges so deeply into it, as we might say, to fall out the other side… Contrary to what he sees as the relativist’s hasty and facile assumption, MacIntyre insists that it is not necessarily (nor always) the case that everyone is so situated that there is no position whose adoption *by her* at *any* time would be rationally superiors to some particular *set* of alternatives…Now the tables are turned, and it is the relativist who appears the dogmatist, claiming to know in advance and *a priori* that no one can be so situated.[@garcia2003]

 This all appears to me correct. MacIntyre uses the genealogist’s starting points to undercut the encyclopedist — a move which implicitly approves of moral relativism. But he doesn’t stop there; he uses all the resources of intellectual history and contemporary natural and social sciences to defend some (but not all) of the beliefs and values of modernity, such as the value of democracy, the value of university education, the value of history, the belief in the possibility of scientific truth, the belief in progress — a move which seems to endorse the Enlightenment and the liberal tradition as against the genealogists. To both, his challenge is to use the best resources of the past and the best rational resources of the present to defend a particular set of conclusions *as the best thus far*, as the *closest* to the truth. To both, his challenge is to defend a conception of morality and rationality *neither* claiming that any such conceptions are impossible *nor* claiming to have *concluded* the enquiry once and for all.

Even after clarifying the obscure points of the dialectic MacIntyre does endorse, the objection can be resolved but not finally refuted. I would like to offer a suggestion below as to why this is so. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality reply 1 - incoherence? ###

MacIntyre would have us believe that 'rationality' is not a disembodied set of timeless and universal procedures of thinking. My rationality includes whatever standards of reasoning I accept, and all the other resources (facts, authorities, memories) I use to judge true and false. 

From my perspective, and my tradition, every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction. But that is just to say that if Walt Whitman or Nagarjuna denies the law (or reflectively affirms contradictory propositions) then I will necessarily judge them to be irrational.[@sepcontradiction. "Do I contradict myself? / Very well, then, I contradict myself. / (I am large, I contain multitudes.)  (Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself”); "Everything is real and not real.
Both real and not real. / Neither real nor not real. / That is Lord Buddha's teaching." (Mūla-madhyamaka-kārikā 18:8), quoted in Garfield (1995: 102)] 

But I wish to go further and say that this strand of Buddhism *really is irrational*. That is, I wish to affirm that they are irrational -- full stop. I am not sure MacIntyre's theory allows me to affirm that. Unless I am missing something crucial here, this seems to me a limitation of the theory. 

Perhaps a qualified acceptance of MacIntyre's claim about tradition-constituted rationality is that when a tradition does not *seem* share this standard of rationality (the value of logical consistency) I should not be too quick to judge that I have really understood their meaning. Perhaps when I ask them if they affirm (S is P and S is not P) they have a slightly different concept in mind for "not" or for "and." Or perhaps they are speaking of an entity instantiating a property and not instantiating that same property at the same time but in ever so slightly different respects. Walt Whitman may be saying he contradicts himself in ever so slightly different respects in order to grasp apparently paradoxical truths that can be predicated of a transcendental modern man. Or perhaps they are denying both P and not P in favor of some other, different articulation of the predicates a given subject instantiates. In the case of any of these alternatives, the principle of charity recommends I extend my interlocutor the benefit of the doubt before concluding that the appearance of irrationality reflects real irrationality. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality reply 2 - clarity

Even if MacIntyre's account is coherent, is it clear?  John Haldane (among others) questions MacIntyre’s ability coherently to identify what a tradition is. What is tradition A? How do we differentiate it from B? Are two traditions separate and hence identifiable only if they are *incommensurable*? How much difference constitutes separation? How much overlap is compatible with difference? Jewish and Christian traditions share a common origin and bear considerable overlap in authorities, scriptures, and doctrines. 

MacIntyre’s definition makes answering these questions difficult. He characterizes a tradition as “separate and unified when its members or texts have a core set of shared commitments to beliefs, when the tradition is situated in a particular context in a particular set of institutions and when the tradition has an identifiable linguistic difference when compared to other traditions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 83] But is there any universal procedure for identifying such linguistic and institutional differences? 

The right response to this call for clarification, I think, comes from Weinstein. We should not expect, by MacIntyre’s lights, that there is an automatically objective, view-from-nowhere by which we can define tradition itself. Rather, MacIntyre concludes that “the concept of a tradition, together with the criteria for its use and application, is itself one developed from within one particular tradition-based standpoint. This does not preclude its application to the very tradition within which it was developed.”[@horton1994after 295] This is liable to frustrate some readers. But the alternative (by MacIntyre’s lights) is intellectual imperialism wherein one tradition has the *real* scoop on every other tradition. MacIntyre grants that his self-definition of his own tradition arises, in part, from his criteria of that tradition. Traditions change over time. They progress (according to their own unchanging standards) toward unchanging goals or else they abandon old standards. 

I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. This may not satisfy critiques but it cordons off their objections. It pushes back, to demand that the critics self-reflect and specify their own tradition (in MacIntyre’s words) even as they demand a definition of the term ‘tradition’ (in their own words). 

### Tradition-constituted rationality 3 - can rationality justify morality? ###

MacIntyre's theory of virtue makes morality depend on rationality. This has been a common, but contentious, belief in the Aristotelian tradition. I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection. D'andrea points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels a critique against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*. 

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is this: the question “why be moral?” is never asked in the abstract. For example, in describing the "self of the heroic age" MacIntyre says, “In heroic society there is no 'outside' except that of the stranger. A man who tried to withdraw himself from his given position in heroic society would be engaged in the enterprise of trying to make himself disappear.”[@macintyre1984after 126] Even though virtues in twenty-first century North America are not what the same as Homer's day, there is a parallel to be drawn. 

Philosophers often ask “why be moral?” hypothetically. They ask it *as if* speaking on the skeptic's behalf, or as if *they* were skeptics. But hypothetical moral skeptics will not do. We must consider a concrete character, real or fictional. Once we look for a real or fictional skeptic, a problem arises. By MacIntyre's lights, sincere “why be moral?” skeptics are political or social outcasts. For millions of people who are full-fledged members of their tradition, the “why be moral?” question will not usually arise. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” do not arise because they are satisfactorily answered.

By contrast, the emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The *polis* to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the *polis* which belongs to him or her. So MacIntyre's theory makes room for people who are not actually skeptical (to whom an answer to Foot's challenge is not required) and people who are actually skeptical but do not belong to their society (to whom an answer to Foot's challenge would be meaningless).

MacIntyre's theory makes room for one more gruop: moral skeptics *are* members of their own tradition but are seeing the problems within their own tradition and who are troubled by a “border tradition”. This type of skeptic sees the resources of a rival tradition and compares such favorably with the resources of his own tradition. The skeptic is, in a word, entering epistemological crisis. 

Specifically, it might be that the moral skeptic has been raised outside of the Aristotelian tradition and is noticing the inadequacies of his or her own tradition, and is entering epistemological crisis. MacIntyre's response is to invite him or her to do the hard work of resolving that crisis by examining, from within the context of a primary tradition *and* a “second first” tradition, the problems at hand and the available solutions, working toward an ever greater understanding of the truth. 

In short, MacIntyre's theory gives an account of two contradictory phenomena. It explains how a moral skeptic might arise within a community and how that skeptic might be moved to a more adequate grasp of the truth; and it explains why, in healthy, unified, moral societies, *so few people become moral skeptics*.

### *Telos* reply 1 ###

The family of objections against teleology are, I think, most potentially disastrous for MacIntyre's theory. If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover *telos*. 

The type of teleology the Aristotelian tradition takes for granted is natural teleology, of which human or social teleology is a human instantiation. The type MacIntyre needs to make his theory work is unclear. Is MacIntyre insisting on Aristotle's point, that our teleology is a "given" as part of our biological makeup? Or is he treating teleology more narrowly? Is teleological behavior not a phenomenon of nature but only a phenemonon of human beings acting intentionally? 

MacIntyre's view is, I think, satisfying. We can sidestep a conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups are end-directed activities. Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. *Telos* can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With *telos* firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether *telos* exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. One quick example will suffice. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. 

The proof of social teleology is reflection on our experience. The alternative to social teleology is fully Aristotelian natural teleology rooted in the metaphysics or in biology. For Aristotle, human end-direction is a subset of the end-direction that appears in all of nature, at least all of biological nature. 

MacIntyre does not need intentionality to be a subset of natural teleology. Rather, he needs his interlocutor to admit that human action is end-directed. We act to achieve goals. Whether we arise from bed *in order to* give a talk, or drive to work *in order to* do a good job, or pursue a career *for* satisfaction and a profitable retirement, we are directing ourselves toward ends. In groups, too, we deliberate about what to do, about *what is to be done*. We pursue group goals. We are directed at group ends. Congress aims to pass just and beneficial laws. The school board aims to increase enrollment and balance the budget. The university administration builds a football stadium *to draw revenue* and to create a football program.  

Now, the adherent of the modern liberal tradition has two options. Either accept it and claim that type of *telos* as part of modernity; or argue that that type of *telos* is non-existent and therefore unnecessary for morality. The genealogist, again, is free to reject that type of *telos* and therefore reject morality altogether.

MacIntyre has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without *telos* becomes an unintelligible set of rules or traditions. Virtue without *telos* literally has no point. A society that enforces chaste behavior and honors chastity as a virtue but does so without any understanding of how such chastity fits into the fulfilled life of a fully virtuous human being and a fully virtuous community will be open to the criticism that such behaviors and virtues are prohibiting a whole range of pleasurable activities.  

I argued above, on behalf of the objection, that Kantianism and consequentialism are teleological. MacIntyre's response would be, I believe, to concede the point. If Kant himself can be interpreted as a teleological ethicist (of a sort), so much the better for Kantian morality. 

MacIntyre's critique of "emotivist" ateleological ethics may apply only to Kantians or to some readers of Kant. But if MacIntyre's analysis of the problem with modern moral philosophy is inaccurate, his solution is still accurate. Moral rules are unintelligible without an understanding of the *internal* and necessary relation between some actions and some outcomes. Kant himself, perhaps, understood this better than many of his contemporary readers give him credit. 

Consequentialism, however, cannot be made to be "teleological" in the Aristotelian or the MacInterean sense. The reason is that Mill has defined "consequences" so as to be always contingent. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalization. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. This good effects are, for Moore, aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships.[@moore Chapter 6.] 

Charles Taylor explains this feature of modern moral theories:

&gt;...They cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

I said above that the refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. Charles Taylor endorses the notion that “the place accorded the virtues [is] a kind of litmus test for discriminating Aristotelian from modern ethical theory.”[@taylor 25] What could this mean? Behind the means/end distinction is a peculiarly modern assumption that formal and final causes are either not related or not *necessarily* related. There are various ways of cashing out this distinction. In biology, it is the distinction between form and function.[@huneman2006naturalising] In engineering it is the distinction between design and operation. 

For consequentialism, the great intrinsic value is happiness, or pleasure. On the surface, this sounds like a kind of Aristotelian eudaimonism. But Aristotle's eudaimonia is the necessary end of all action and all practical reasoning. The proof that we pursue eudaimonia (something vague) is as robust as the proof that we pursue *anything at all*. For Mill, happiness is something too specific: pleasure, or freedom from pain. He offers precious little justification for this. All that Mill can say to the enquirer who wants to hear about *why* happiness is desirable is that people desire it.

&gt;It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?
&gt;Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfill -- to make good its claim to be believed?
&gt;The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.[@mill chapter 4, "Of what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible"]

Mill's definition of happiness cannot be that thing we all necessarily pursue whenever we act, because then moral rules (guiding us toward the happiness of the greatest number) would be unnecessary. We would all, already, pursue happiness. 

Furthermore, Mill, like Moore, sees the relation between the end (happiness) and the means (actions that bring about happiness) as statistical, contingent, and probable. There is no internal relation between some actions (such as virtues) and the proper end of human life.

But this demand is unreasonable. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constitutive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species *gorilla gorilla* as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics. 

In sum, the rebuttal of the “no teleology objection" is that the sort of teleology we need is defensible: social teleology. On the one hand, Kantian philosophy may be able to accommodate social teleology, and so would escape the brunt of MacIntyre's criticism. On the other hand, the rebuttal of consequentialism, is that it has not often been taken to allow for a necessary relation between some means and their ends. Virtuous action both *causes* and *partly constitutes* virtuous character. Virtuous character traits both *cause* and *partly constitute* the kind of achievement of our human *telos* that makes life worth living. 


## Conclusion

### Chapter summary
MacIntyre's concepts form an organic whole. In this chapter I have tried to present his theory of virtue and practical rationality within traditions. I began by explaining MacIntyre's unique intellectual history and his unique theory of traditions. I then presented his account of virtue as necessarily existing in the context of practices, the narrative of human life, the self, and the achievement of our as-yet-unrealized *telos*. If my summaries have captured the core of MacIntyre's contribution to virtue ethics, we can offer a few conclusions with some confidence. Virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. And each community *needs* the virtues. 

Now, different traditions offer varying accounts of virtue and "lists" of virtues. MacIntyre's career has been one of struggling with the problem of disagreement in its moral, philosophical, religious, and scientific manifestations. So I presented three families of objections to MacIntyre's virtue theory: the relativism objections, the tradition-constituted rationality objections, and the no teleology objections.  

I offered rebuttals of these objections. First, I further explained how MacIntyre's theory of rationality can accommodate "relativity" as a condition of inquiry without collapsing into "relativism" as a conclusion of inquiry. Second, I further clarified the concept of tradition-constituted rationality as necessarily recursive and thus impossible to define outside of the context of a tradition. I did concede that, from within my tradition, there appear to be no legitimate traditions who embrace contradictory propositions or who deny the Law of Non-Contradiction. Third, I defended MacIntyre's use of (at least) "social teleology" as a grounding for the teleological virtue ethics. And I conceded that some modern morality (such as a version of Kantianism) might plausibly be conceived as teleological in the way that MacIntyre's theory demands. But I denied that other modern moralities (such as paradigmatic versions of consequentialism) can be conceived as teleological in the proper way since they treat the relation of means to ends as a merely contingent relation. 

If MacIntyre is right here, then the project of restoring *telos* should invigorate optimism. Ethics, reinvigorated with teleology, might just be able to escape some of its modern quandaries. And not only ethics. Law, political philosophy, and applied disciplines like politics itself, rhetoric and debate, social philosophy, and others disciplines are given new promise and new hope. 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. 

### Two concluding remarks ###

I would like to close this chapter with a reflection on MacIntyre's unique style of enquiry, which is polarizing. 

MacIntyre is a theorist of rationality (and of practical rationality and hence virtue). Hence rationally to assess his theory requires thinking through our own theory of rationality. But thinking about rationality is thinking through our own thinking. The errors we make in thinking are likely to be underscored by our attempts to *think them through*. The Greek proverb is: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” The Latin proverb (from a very different context) is “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” — who will guard the guards themselves? I believe the answer to the rhetorical question is *no one at all* can guard the guards; if water chokes us, there is *nothing at all we can drink to wash it down*. Likewise, if something is deeply wrong with the way we think, how can theorizing about rationality right the wrong? Some of the errors MacIntyre diagnoses in thinkers who belong to the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition will be invisible to those thinkers. 

Even if MacIntyre’s diagnosis is *correct* -- especially if it is correct -- the readers who especially need to hear it will find the diagnosis unintelligible, even irrational. Insofar as the "patient" finds any parts of his theory intelligible, they will seem radical, disastrous in their social implications, and destructive of the very nature and purpose of education. The reason these appearances will be insuperable to MacIntyre’s patient is because the patient is, by his lights, self-deceived. He or she simply denies being part of a tradition, and hence denies having a particular (rather than universal) tradition-bound conception of rationality, and hence denies having a particular, tradition-bound conception of the good (perhaps the good is unbounded freedom to follow the moral law, or to pursue happiness,, and justice unfettered equality). Modernity is the “tradition-less tradition” and hence *must* deny tradition to be consistent with itself. 

The solution to this paradox is that MacIntyre directs *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and other books at the liberal modern who is discontented with the tradition. This "patient" comes to MacIntyre with manifesting symptoms. MacIntyre offers one possible diagnosis, and the patient’s job is to investigate further. The patient needs philosophical imagination to even *consider* the possibility of another truth. The patient needs patience, intellectual courage, and self-reflection. The patient needs to sit in front of the proverbial mirror and mouth the words, (a) “I am part of a tradition” and (b) “my tradition might be inadequate,” and (c) “that other tradition might have the resources more adequately to address the intellectual and practical problems that I now see are insuperable to my tradition.” 

For example, MacIntyre's theory can answer the worry about relativism discussed above. Yet for some critics the worry still clings. I would suggest that full resolution of the criticism can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves. MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the enquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the enquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that enquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the enquiry. 

It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side "just isn’t doing philosophy anymore." My only point here is that *which side that is* is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal philosophers that Thomistic “philosophy” isn’t philosophy at all.[@lutz2004tradition chapter 5.] It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian-type philosophers that modern secular “philosophy” isn’t philosophy at all. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

A second concluding remark is my tentative suggestion as to MacIntyre's legacy. One feature we might observe about great thinkers — Plato, Aquinas, Kant, and a dozen of others — is that they present a totalizing theory that explains many phenomena but also explains why critics criticize. Great thinkers present not only philosophical solutions to philosophical problems, but a definition or understanding of philosophy itself. They are always philosophers *and* metaphilosophers. This feature satisfies their followers and frustrates their critics. For to criticize such a thinker feels like falling into a well-laid trap. One of the signs, I believe, of MacIntyre’s greatness is just this feature. He presents not only isolated theories but a theoretical system in which critics, depending on their criticism, receive a name, a number, a category, a classification, and a designated response. Adherents, too, are accommodated. But to criticize MacIntyre is much trickier business than one might suspect at first. Critics find themselves dipping into one of many already well-poisoned wells, and falling into pre-laid traps. The critic who would escape the battery is more likely to flee rather than engage; but the critic who would escape by engaging and overcoming is liable to meet her match. Again, while this may be infuriating, I believe it to be a sign of greatness.

            <Text>Some people believe “nature is it” — nature (spacetime, energy, and whatever the smallest bits of matter are,in various configurations) is all there is. Some others believe nature is not “it.” There is nature, spacetime, matter, energy, etc. plus something else. These views are not compatible. As contrary statements, one must be true and the other false (I don’t see how both could be false, other than to say that there is neither nature nor anything else... but let’s ignore that.) 

A catalog of the beliefs of all the philosophers and scientists would list some of each on either side. 

As philosophical disagreements go, the view that nature is or is not “it” — the “whole show” — is something more than a philosophical agreement. Each thought runs down deep into the heart and mind of the person who thinks it, tying together a dizzying array of related beliefs: is there a god? Do we have souls? Is matter (or the entire cosmos) eternal? How old is the cosmos? Is there an objective meaning or significance to human life? What is death?

As such, these respective views are banners of not merely the philosophical framework in which all of life, let alone scientific and philosophical inquiry, but of differing cultures. 

It is difficult to confront someone from a widely varying culture. Once, on a trip to Mongolia to teach English to high schoolers, I had an argument with a middle-aged, drunk Mongolian man about American “imperialism.” With his mistress on his arm (his wife was at home), he smiled and shouted at me to “go home,” to take my American clothing, religion, language, music, and movies back to America with me and leave him in peace. I did not, at the time, understand his worry or his anger. I was a freshmen in college and had lived in the U.S. my whole life, and had only visited Mexico and Canada. What do you mean “American clothes”? I just thought of them as clothes.  I was the fish that did not know he was wet. Another time, on my first visit to New York, I dialogued with a Muslim on the street outside a mosque. “You believe that God is the creator, and all-merciful, and the father of men, right?” He was incensed. “No, God is not my father. That would make me, his son, a god. God is my creator, my ruler, my master, not my father.” He did not understand me, nor I him. 

The peril of miscommunication in such conversations between people of radically differing cultures is great. So when discussing the view that “nature is it”, a proportionally great caution is needed. Merely citing the writings of thinkers on either side of the debate is not enough. We must be (or become) sensitive to the differing emotions, motivations, and all-important implications of each side. 

Most people prefer others who think, talk, and act like themselves. As much as possible, human nature likes to “live and let live.” But there exist reasons, some highly important reasons, for transgressing into the boundaries of another culture and “making converts.” If Richard Dawkins sees supernaturalism (the view that nature is not all there is) as militating against proper scientific research, enslaving millions in falsehood and irrationality, he cannot simply stand by and let delusions be delusions. If Edward Feser sees the view that nature is it as militating against proper religious belief, enslaving millions in falsehood and irrationality, he cannot simply stand by and let delusions be delusions. 

Professional philosophers have a professional interest in persuading other philosophers of their views. But anyone on either side of this intellectual fault line probably knows and cares about someone else on the other side — “the far side.” It might be close friends, colleagues, public intellectuals, their own parents or children. The stakes are high. 

As a universal affirmative categorical proposition, “All that exists is a natural thing,” a single instance of a non-natural thing (whether sub-natural or super-natural) furnishes a contradiction. The universal affirmative disjunctive proposition, “All that exists is either natural or non-natural” is trivial in being necessarily true. Better then to frame the disagreement as a universal negative categorical statement on the one hand, and a particular affirmative categorical proposition on the other: “No things that exist are non-natural things,” as against “Some things that exist are non-natural things.” As a logically contradictory pair, the disagreement is clear. Naturalists really do affirm the first; non-naturalists really do affirm the second. 

What kinds of entities or properties are thought to be at least possibly non-natural? Aquinas’ God and angels, St. Paul’s human souls, Plato’s forms, heccaeties, Spinoza’s monads, Hegel’s geist, Moore’s property of goodness, and more. A middle class of possibly non-natural objects are numbers, universals, properties, propositions, sets, moral values. 

The goal of this paper is to examine a set of the best arguments in favor of the existence of any non-natural entities and a set of arguments opposed to their existence. But a subsidiary goal, necessarily more speculative and obscure, is to examine the motivations and deeper and broader cultural differences between these sets of arguments. Why think nature is it? Why think nature is not it? And, more deeply, why? </Text>

            <Text>Does virtue ethics rest on the ideally virtuous exemplars or real, virtuous exemplars? 

It seems that virtue ethics defines virtue with reference to what the ideally virtuous agent would do. The right course of action is “What a virtuous agent would, characteristically, do in the circumstances.”Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics p. 17. 

On the other hand, Aristotle himself uses Pericles as an embodied, historical, flesh and blood moral exemplar. 

I argue that the hypothetical virtuous agent is neither action guiding nor content-full. 
Each exemplar embodies a tradition. MacIntyre says that “characters are the masks of ethical theories.”After Virtue  32? % 33? This is no objection against my view since I stand unabashedly in a broader western and narrower religious tradition. But it might be taken as an objection from a secular person who does not identify with either any religious tradition nor even with his or her own “civilization”, which is after all sexist, racist, classist, imperalist, or what have you.

            <Title>How do I deal with objections and objectors?</Title>
            <Text>How I deal with objections
One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocutors, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproariously funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocutors are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergraduates are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to let the dead bury their own dead. 

While writing a platonic dialogue is a form of art I still find appealing and still use, that is not the best vehicle for this dissertation. So I am forced to give the views I think mistaken the best hearing I can give them in my own voice. 

The challenge of metaethical inquiry, I think, is to engage readers who do not already agree with you. A constant danger to which we are all liable is assuming too many crucial propositions and arguing at length about a bunch of relatively peripheral propositions. Metaethicists who steer clear of this danger are the likes of Alan Gibbard and Robert Adams. There is some value to articulating, clarifying, and defending a view that reader and author both (already) share. But that is not the valuable enterprise I aim for. 

The test, I think, shall be whether these pages find readers who disagree with the core thesis I present in Chapter 3, and, if so, whether they can recognize "their own" purported view in the pages that follow. If they can not only recognize but resoundingly affirm the view expressed in that chapter, then my objections may have some bite and may earn the high honor of receiving a rebuttal. 

It would not be a failure if no one found these pages; most such essays do not find readers, even if they deserve them. Failure would be for some ethical naturalist to pick up the book or a chapter on a shelf or online, glance at the view expressed, and to disown what I claim is his own. </Text>

            <Title>Brown, Moral Virtue and Nature </Title>
            <Text>Stephen Brown

Brown's project is to advance the cause of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism.  His opening lines are these: 

&gt;Human beings are a species of social animal for which there is a characteristic way of life. An individual human being may be evaluated as good or bad according to how well that individual realizes the human way of life. I argue that there is teleology in nature; that the fact/value gap — however we reasonably construe that idea — not an overriding concern; and that neo-Darwinism is no threat to the theory. (Brown 2008, 1)

In this chapter, I provide a detailed summary and analysis of Brown’s primary theses. 

Naturalism?
Brown's aim is to defend a species of ethical naturalism that is cognitivist and in which "important ethical norms and evaluations are grounded in natural facts." (2008, 2). He does not reject outright but rather brackets the supernatural. And he defines 'nature' as "what[ever] our latest and best science tells us it is" including psychology and sociology along with physics and biology. 

Brown’s naturalism plays a stronger role than he makes it seem to here. In fact, the assumption that “human beings are continuous with nature” is essential to his project. But this is a highly tendentious assumption. It is an assumption that naturalists regularly make. But it is justified? 

%% Stopped here in writing intro sequences


Explanandum
What is the explanandum for ethical naturalism? There are several. Each may need to look to its own science for an answer. 

* How an individual comes to have the norms he or she does: psychology, personal history. 
* How a group comes to have the norms they do: sociology, anthropology, etc. 
* For Brown, it is important to distinguish virtue ethics from “decision theory”. Virtue ethics may not tell us what to do.
He admits, and seems melancholically resigned to the fact, that what we "end up with [might be] a mere description and not, alas, a justification..." (Brown 3).

Teleology 
The metaphysical framework in which Brown wants to build ethical naturalism is this: nature is teleological. (Compare Nagel's natural teleology.) He doesn't want to reduce ethics to biology or physics, but to explain ethics in "terms of the rest of nature" (Brown 5, quoting Bernard Williams).
But what is the "rest of nature?" Especially if human beings are radically continuous with nature, as he avers, why do we even keep such locutions as "the rest"? He means that "the rest" of nature includes non-human stuff (rocks, stars, trees) and non-ethical human stuff (psychology, biology, culture, etc.). But wait. Does ethical naturalism have to ground normative facts in non-normative facts? No. He, along with Nagel, finds this dogmatic starting point unjustified. Rather, some normative facts are brute (for their domain at least) and ground other normative facts. These natural normative facts are natural teleological facts. "Teleology allows us to infer normative conclusions" (Brown 5). 

Values as Real and Scientifically Knowable
He also wants to account for our criterion that ethics seems objective. He also wants to account for the sense that ethics can be or should be a science or something like a science or continuous with another recognizable science or (at the very least) not inconsistent with other recognizable sciences. 

Social Utility
As a social group, we have a common good. For Aristotle -- and Brown seems to agree -- your good, my good, and our social good are intimately interrelated. 

Social and political pluralism has pros and cons. Brown hopes a naturalistic ethical theory may be of some use in negotiating the "methods of dealing with conflicts among divergent belief systems" (2008, 10). Rather than rooting putative ethical truths in contentious religious claims, we may hope to root ethical truths in a universally accessible nature. We may hope to have "freedom *of* religion as well as freedom *from* religion", enjoying whatever truths might originate from a religious tradition without relying on that religion (10). We may hope that the one thing that unites us, our common human nature, may be a source of commanility in guidance on how to live. 


#### Telos and Function - General considerations
The way we discover our common nature is by examine our *ergon* (our proper work). Brown says that this ergon is almost *function*, but not quite. He summarizes Aristotle's famous argument that *eudaimonia* is our good but seems to favor the second argument. 

&gt;If we know a thing's function, then we can easily figure out what it is for the thing to function well. A thing's functinong well is its best good. Thus, if we know what the function of a human being *qua* human being is, then we can figure out what it is for a human being to function well, and this well functioning of a human being is the best good for that sort of being. (Brown 23)

The function of a thing, in Aristotle, is the work it performs that is not also the function of other things. Each thing like 'hammer' has a differentia from all non-hammers -- namely, pounding or hammering. And each type of hammer has a differentia from other hammers: framing, finishing hammer, mallot, sledge, etc., all pound but pound different objects or do so differently. But human beings live and grow and metabolize like plants; we sense perceive like horses, oxen, and other animals; our ergon 'expresses' or 'requires'  *reason* (or as Foot would have it, speech). Our function is to reason; our good is reasoning well. 

How reasoning well relates wth virtue is a bit trickier. Are virtues simply (by definition) the reasonable activities? If so, then the connection between reason and virtue remains tight. But if not, they need to be connected. 

I was illuminated by Brown's discussion of three related concepts:

* the human good
* the good human being
* good for a human being

Here is one way of putting it: If virtue is the human good, then a good human is virtuous, and virtues are (as we say of spinach and broccoli) "good for us." By "virtue is the human good" we seem to mean our good qua species. By "good for us" we mean something more specific to individual members of the species. Something related to the human good is good for us in that it feels good, actualizes our potential, fulfills us, perfects us, or something like that. 


#### The function of artifacts and natural kinds
What is the function of a horse? Brown's discussion effectively explores all the options here. Unlike a knife or other artificial object, the function of a horse would not be defined by human artifice. Nor is a horse's function or ergon obviously some work relating to human use (riding, pulling, etc.). It is implausible to suppose that a species is indexed to another species, that a the species is incomplete without being used by humans; furthermore, the individual jobs horses do might be more effectively done by other species (oxen, etc.). But horses have been in some part bred by humans for human purposes (riding, showing, fighting, hunting). So it might be that the *current* breeds of domesticated horses *are in fact* more like knives than wild dogs. Even so, what about other non-domesticated horses? Either they have no ergon at all, or their ergon is something unrelated to human artifice. 

Take the first option: horses have no ergon, no function, no discernable final cause, no unique activity they do that nothing else in nature does. Does this option mean we are giving up on "natural teleology" for biology? Plato and Aristotle both speak as if all of nature was teleological. So it would mean giving up on the platonic or Aristotelian version of teleology, for whatever that is worth. But Plato's teleology in the *Timaeus* is admittedly mythical and speculative, while Aristotle explores non-teleological explanations of natural phenomena in his *Physics*, the he says that "Nature does nothing absurdly or to no purpose" (*De Caelo* 291b14). So we haven't quite given up on Aristotle yet. Rather, we need to hear how, if at all, he articulates the natural teleology of individual biological species. 

#### An argument by analogy?
Brown highlights that Aristotle's argument by analogy amounts to a rhetorical question with which he is trying to "badger" us.  Aristotle's human craftsmen have jobs or functions -- the carpenter works with wood, the horse trainer trains horses, and so on -- so are we to say that humans have no function?

* Humans A, B, C, etc. (qua roles we play, mothers, fathers, craftsmen, etc) all have functions. (via observation)
* Therefore humanity (qua species) have functions. (via inductive generalization)

* Humans (qua members of the species) are like craftsmen.
* All craftsmen have functions. (via observation)
* Therefore humans (qua species) have functions. (via analogy to first premise)

But in what way are humans "like" craftsmen? Aristotle's argument crucially depends on whether one accepts the fundamental comparison between humans qua biological creatures and the roles humans play. 


#### Contemporary methods
Brown's suggestion is to apply more familiar methods for finding function. Suppose we find a mysterious artefact in an archeological dig. How would we discover its function? We would compare it to similar known objects of the same time and place, if possible. If there are no similar objects, then we might use the object for various purposes to ascertain what it does (not just what it does *uniquely well*). Of course, multiple objects do the same thing: Brown mentions that phones and email both communicate across long distances. 

A response: His example doesn't tell. The "primitive human stumbling across various items" does not have time to familiarize herself with the telephone and email. He does not mention that, given time and/or instruction, the primitive human would discover what we industrialized moderns already know: that email is most often best for asynchronic communication, and phone most often best for synchronic communication. 

Regardless, Brown suggests that the biologist looking at organs "faces similar problems"  (Brown 2008, 30). She can compare the functions of similar organisms; if no similar organs are forthcoming, she can see what it *does*. And she can "look at the organ from an evolutionary standpoint" -- that is, "see what effects the existence of the organ has on the survival and reproduction of the organism" (Brown 2008, 30). This last does not invalidate the Platonic/Aristotelian method of looking for what the organism does best, but supplements it. 

#### The human function
So what about human beings qua species? Forget my individual telos for a moment. When we examine the function of any old item of human life, say, a knife, we see that it cuts. 
&gt;What is the purpose of cutting vegetables? To prepare them for cooking. Why prepare vegetables for cooking? So we can eat them. What is the purpose of eating? so we can go on living. The series could stop there, but one could continue on and ask what the purpose in living is. In that we confront an existential question. (Brown 31-32)
Before strongly arguing for or against any of the options, Brown mentions and considers several. 
He briefly considers just ending the series by repeating the last answer: we eat in order to keep living, and we live in order to keep living -- the end. He also considers that the question loses its species-indexed meaning at this point and becomes member-indexed -- what is *my* purpose.  He also considers whether that question has any meaning — perhaps it is an idle and ill-framed question — but ultimately endeavors to answer it. Finally, he considers what would be the significance of answering in the negative. If I qua member of my species have no intrinsic purpose does that mean that any of my self-selected purposes — from social work to suicide — are equally good? 
Brown ultimately concludes that we have no purpose qua human being. We have roles which are inseparable from purposes, even if there is no “humanity” at the base of these roles by which to judge a deeper or ultimate purpose. 
A response: I don’t think feeble speculations to the contrary will very satisfyingly hinder a suicidal person, in the grips of existential despair, from contemplating the wildest and most irrational deeds of harming self and other. That is not to say that my philosophy would. For the bar is set high for philosophies that would explain (a) why most people prefer to live and indeed love life, and (b) why, in spite of arguments to the contrary, (a) is still true. 
Carrying on with the notion that our roles define us, Brown considers a theological version of the story. The function of life is “to love God, to do His will, to serve Him.” (Brown 2008, 33). One’s job is not only one’s career but one’s calling to live for God in every respect: professionally and personally and so on. 

Eudaemonism
Brown is not eudaemonistic. His relationship to eudaemonism is interesting and complex. He affirms the proposition that human have a natural end. He denies that the natural end is happiness. Rather, the natural end is reproduction (and only indirectly, survival). Individual and group survival, characteristic freedom from pain, the well-functioning of the social group — the ends he provisionally accepts from Hursthouse’s account — these contribute to the passing on of genes. They are good because they so contribute. They get what value they have from the ultimate value, reproductive success. But is this value even good? 


Facts and Values
Brown’s discussion of the infamous fact/value split is excellent. He distinguishes between five alleged gaps, and dispenses with the concern that makes such a gap seem so devastating. They are the ontological gap, the logical gap, the semantic gap, the epistemological gap, and the motivational gap. 
The one Brown thinks is truly a worthy opponent is the “motivational gap”. He says “this might be the problem of ethics” (95, original emphasis). If there is a real motivational gap this might be evidence for the ontological gap (95). “The proponent of the motivational gap holds that values can motivate someone to act or give them reasons to act, whereas non-values cannot” (%Brown 95). But if values reduce to non-values then it seems that we act for every reason but a reason: animal instincts, desires, fears, or neurophysiological flukes. 
The externalist about motivation thinks that the gap can be bridged by desires (95). So perhaps all moral reasons for acting are desires. But desires are hypothetical  — if you want to eat a burger, eat at Joe’s — and aren’t moral reasons categorical reasons? If moral reasons all have an antecedent like “if you are a human being, then do x” then the hypothetical imperative amounts to a categorical one. The antecedent holds true for all of us. 

A response: This is a bit cheeky. 

Moral Virtue and Nature (Evolution Objection) 

In chapter five, Brown asks this question: is naturalized virtue ethics an ‘evolutionary ethic’? That is, does virtue ethics merely describe and explain the way we happen to live ethical lives, judge ourselves and each other, and strive for a variety of ends? 

William James wrote about natural selection: "The entire modern deification of survival per se, survival returning into itself, survival naked and abstract, with the denial of any substantive excellence in what survives, except for more survival still, is surely the strangest intellectual stopping-place ever proposed by one man to another".[3]

Michael Ruse (% 1986): “Our moral sense, our altruistic nature, is an adaptation—a feature helping us in the struggle for existence and reproduction—no less than hands and eyes, teeth and feet. It is a cost-effective way of getting us to cooperate, which avoids both the pitfalls of blind action and the expense of a superbrain of pure rationality. “Evolutionary Ethics: A phoenix arisen.” Zygon Journal of Religion and Science, 21, p. 99. Available online athttp://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/educational_materials/Ruse1986/Ruse1986.pdf

Our place in nature
“In a sense … the evolutionist's case is that ethics is a collective illusion of the human race, fashioned and maintained by natural selection in order to promote individual reproduction. … ethics is illusory inasmuch as it persuades us that it has an objective reference. This is the crux of the biological position.” % Ruse, p. 235.

Brown says, “Naturalized virtue ethics assumes continuity between human beings and the rest of nature.” So, human beings are “an evolved species”Brown 101.%   Some think that this implies that there is no human nature, or that humans are “sub-optimal” or that ethics has no normative authority. He refutes the first two worries but concedes the third. 


Brown’s description of our place in nature is quite lovely, even if (as I think) it is false. “Human beings are a kind of animal that live in various terrestrial environments on a small planet in the corner of a medium-sized galaxy in the midst of a very large universe. ‘Man’ does not just have a place in nature: we are nature. Not only are we creatures susceptible to the vicissitudes of the environments in which we make our way, but we are also ourselves environments, and parts of environments for other creatures. The continuity of human beings and nature is a fundamental assumption of naturalism. The distinction between the ‘artificial’ creations of humans and the ‘natural’ creations of other plants and animals has its roots in a collective illusion under which almost all of us dwell, except perhaps when at our most reflective. This collective illusion is that humans are different from nature: and not just different in degree from the ‘lesser’ animals, but different in some way that, for lack of a better term, we might call metaphysical. That said, there is perhaps a basis of truth in many illusions. Human beings have some phenotypic traits that, we suspect, are not shared by the other animals. One of our special traits allows us to reflect and to theorize.
	“In the usual Linnaean taxonomic scheme, human beings are of the kingdom animalia, the phylum chordata, the class mammal, the order primate, the family hominid, the genus homo, and the species sapiens. To differentiate modern humans from our more immediate ancestors, our subspecies is indicated by adding another ‘aspens’ to the binomial nomenclature, making us Homo sapiens sapiens. Apparently, H. s. Sapiens has been here for some time, at least by human historical standards. The oldest discovered evidence dates to approximately the Late Pleistocene of 120,000 years ago. Presumably, we got here — here in the sense of ‘this place and time’ as well as here in the sense of ‘the way we are’ — in more or less the very way in which all the other kinds of organisms did. We evolved” (% Brown 104). 

Darwinism Two Objections
There is no teleology
Brown presents two Darwinian obstacles to naturalized virtue ethics. The first is that flourishing is not possible for haphazardly constructed animals whose only design plan is that chance and natural selection preserve all non-lethal genetic mutations. In a word, human beings are “a mess” % Brown 104. The second is that Darwinism might undermine natural teleology. Teleology, we recall, is the basis of natural normativity at least in living things. 
But Brown rejects “global teleology.” The only teleology is such as evolutionary theory underwrites rather than undermines. That is, his view “does not commit one to believing in an ‘orchestral score’ according to which we should each play our ‘special part’.”% Brown 110. Rather, human life is more like a “jazz improvisation.”Brown 111 %.  Evolution has to explain the unity and diversity of human nature. The unity is that human nature is a “set of adaptations shared by all races and ethnic groups.”Brown 110. % Yet for each individual there are “many paths a human being could take in this life”Brown 110. %  Human nature provides  a “deep structure” defined by those adaptations of our species. Brown makes the analogy to Chomsky’s insight about grammar being innate, while first languages vary widely according to culture. But, he says, “from the gene’s point of view, as it were, culture is just mor environment and thus provides different adaptive problems to solve.”Brown 111. % In terms of teleology, it exists within the song according to the intentions of the musicians. 

A responses: 
1. Just how evolutionary explanations underwrite (non-global) teleology is not clear to me. 
2. Erik Wielenberg argues that evolutionary debunking arguments fail. 
x-scrivener-item:///Users/KEDB/Google%20Drive/Dissertation/dissertation.scriv?id=385
The evolutionary debunking argument proceeds as follows:
1. If moral belief that P is explained by evolutionary processes, then the belief is not warranted. 
2. Moral beliefs are explained by evolutionary processes. 
3. Therefore, all moral beliefs are not warranted. 


We are a mess
A satisfactory life, Williams objects, is not possible for evolved creatures. We are “doomed to be sub-optimal.”Brown 112. % Brown is willing to concede this point. But he thinks it not devastating. “We should not expect to be fully happy, insofar as happiness requires an ideal match between our evolved psychological processes and current environments.”Brown 112. % 

Brown concedes that a completely satisfactory life is perhaps not possible. That is, if we take ‘satisfactory’ to be denoting the subjective state of the human, “this is not a problem for a naturalistic ethical theory that makes no assumptions about the possibility of human happiness.” Brown 106.%  So Brown’s concession — and Williams’ objection — tells against eudaemonism but not a fully naturalized virtue ethic. Brown suggests (to my mind, suggests rather weakly) that “Aristotle thinks [the fully virtuous human being] will be happier than someone who lacks the virtues”Brown 106. % 

A response: I find this sanguine interpretation of Aristotle far too quick. 
The philosopher who wrote that “the activity of this in accordance with its proper virtue will be perfect happiness”Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book X. %

“If happiness is activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable that it should be in accordance with the highest virtue; and this will be that of the best thing in us. Whether it be reason or something else that is this element which is thought to be our natural ruler and guide and to take thought of things noble and divine, whether it be itself also divine or only the most divine element in us, the activity of this in accordance with its proper virtue will be perfect happiness.”

“But such a life would be too high for man; for it is not in so far as he is man that he will live so, but in so far as something divine is present in him; and by so much as this is superior to our composite nature is its activity superior to that which is the exercise of the other kind of virtue. If reason is divine, then, in comparison with man, the life according to it is divine in comparison with human life. But we must not follow those who advise us, being men, to think of human things, and, being mortal, of mortal things, but must, so far as we can, make ourselves immortal, and strain every nerve to live in accordance with the best thing in us; for even if it be small in bulk, much more does it in power and worth surpass everything. This would seem, too, to be each man himself, since it is the authoritative and better part of him. It would be strange, then, if he were to choose not the life of his self but that of something else. And what we said before' will apply now; that which is proper to each thing is by nature best and most pleasant for each thing; for man, therefore, the life according to reason is best and pleasantest, since reason more than anything else is man. This life therefore is also the happiest.”


A response: Brown confidentially assuring us that perfect virtuousness, suboptimal functioning, and full happiness are not possible is sort of like a visitor to Kentucky confidently assuring us that there is no such thing as the perfect bourbon whiskey. Meanwhile, we are sipping on a nice mellow two fingers of Woodford Reserve on the rocks, none the wiser. Poor us. Brown is not persuading me about the possibility of happiness and virtue; he is confessing that he does’t know many happy and virtuous folks. I suggested that one aspect of criteria four above might be that our ethical theory explain why joyful people are joyful, explain the phenomenon of powerful and glorious happiness. These people are empirical data. Their lives give the lie to this false pessimism Brown is preaching. 

Our end is reproductive success which may not even be good? 
Brown aims for a “theoretical unification” of the ”natural human ends” of which virtues “reliably enable the realisation [sic %]”.Brown 113. % He understands that a resistance to this conclusion might drive some philosophers to give up on theoretical unification, or to give up on ethical theorizing altogether. But he thinks following the argument worthwhile. 
The de facto end of evolutionary processes is reproductive success. Perhaps reproductive success is the ultimate end to which the other four characteristic ends are only proximate? The good functioning of the social group does after all contribute to the survival of the members of the group and of the species. In this final chapter, all the living richness of Aristotle’s ethics and all the careful and contoured considerations Brown has constructed flatline into the simple, monolithic, two-dimensional plane of survival. The only possible ultimate natural end of human life is reproductive success. Brown’s almost hypnotic repetition of the phrase “reproductive success” emphasizes his insistence on according his philosophical view with the current scientistic vogue. 
 
The final worry Brown considers whether this ultimate end is even good. His answer is that Aristotle was right: the good is that at which all people aim. And all people aim at reproductive success. So (perhaps) reproductive success is good.  
He admits that he hasn’t really answered the question. “That is all the naturalist has”Brown 122. % It is desired but is it desirable? It is loved but is it lovable? It is praised but is it praiseworthy? It is valued but is it really valuable? 

A response: if the end of all biological life is the same (reproductive success) then there is no unique end for each species. Hence there is no unique end for humans. This conclusion fits with Brown’s earlier claim that we have no purpose. But it contradicts Aristotle’s scheme that each logos includes a unique end, which is one of the properties that differentiates it from other species. It contradicts the notion (that Brown seems to accept) that we can identify a thing’s function by empirically researching its characteristic functions. He is not willing to take that notion out to inanimate objects — we should not conclude that stars aim to twinkle on the basis of the empirical observation that they twinkle better than asteroids. (The unwillingness to accept this conclusion rests more rhetorical force, perhaps, on the word ‘twinkle’ than on the ridiculousness of the thought.) But he has not commented on whether the notion applies universally for animate objects. What would be his response? 

“The naturalized virtue ethics advanced by Brown is a goods-based view according to which the goodness of the virtues derives from the goodness of our ultimate end. So virtues, while not theoretically fundamental, are ethically fundamental; they are the marks for which we look when evaluating individual human beings as good instances of the kind human being.” Former O’Hagan’s review (https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23896-moral-virtue-and-nature-a-defense-of-ethical-naturalism/)</Text>

Outline of chapters

In chapter 1, I argue that normative realism is true. Chapter 1 has 2 parts. In the first, I summarize what I take to be the facts that need explaining. These explananda are the variety of kinds of normative discourse and objects of normative discourse represented in our life as lived. In the second, I argue that the best explanation of these phenomena will be normative realism: that is, normative discourse is truth-apt, that normative propositions are either true or false when they represent or fail to represent the normative facts. These arguments are not intended to persuade normative nihilists, whose objections are far too subtle for me, or perhaps anyone, to pursue. 

In chapter 2, I assume that naturalism is true, but far too vague to be useful. Chapter 2 has 2 parts. In the first part, I tell the history of naturalism as a philosophical doctrine and the concept of nature, science. In the second part, I taxonomize contemporary naturalisms and push for clarification of its key terms, namely, nature and science. 

In chapter 3, I argue that either normative realism is true or reductive physicalism is true. But normative realism is true, so physicalism is false. Chapter 3 has 3 parts. In the first part, I lay out the naturalistic metaethical options: physicalist functionalism, and relaxed naturalistic consequentialism. In the second part, I argue that the first is false. In the third part, I argue that consequentialist physicalism (even of the non-reductive sort) is hopelessly inadequate to the facts laid out in chapter 1. 

Chapter z has x parts. In chapter 4, I argue that Thomas Nagel’s anti-metaphysics is true but not true enough.  a sort of rationalistic quietism of Thomas Nagel, the scientific consequentialism of Richard Boyd and the Cornell Realists, the neo-Aristotelianism of Philippa Foot. I shall argue against quietism, and consequentialism.


Chapter v has x parts. In chapter 5, I argue that neo-Aristotelianism is true as a virtue ethics and a metaethics. 

Chapter y has x parts. In chapter 6, I argue

            <Title>#### Virtue Relativism</Title>
            <Text>#### Relativism Objection

Perhaps the most recurring objection to MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy is a cluster of worries about relativism. Virtue, it seems, is relative to practices, to communities, to institutions, or to “rival versions of moral inquiry” — in a word, virtue is relative to traditions, and traditions are (or might be) incommensurable to each other. Acceptance of a tradition entails acceptance of *a* particular definition of virtue and list of virtues; denial of a tradition (or denial of *tradition itself*) entails the rejection of any definition of virtue and list of virtues. In light of this interpretation of his ethical theory, all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that group consider to be virtues, not what virtues actually are. The inquirer interested in, say, which tradition is *correct* or which version of moral inquiry is *correct* is at a loss. 

I should point out that accusing a theory of relativism is only an “accusation” if relativism is false. Relativists rejoice. MacIntyre, in their view, is an aid in the fight of undermining the kind of philosophical ethics that arrogates itself as objective, universal, and absolute. The relativist of morality (and what’s more, the relativist of rationality) is not my primary audience, so I shall assume that relativism is false or at least undesirable, and treat the charge of relativism as an accusation. 

#### Relativism Objection Reply 

MacIntyre has responded to (and he thinks refuted) the charge of relativism multiple times, in his primary works and in “responses to critics.” Yet the stain of relativism remains, for many, in the image of MacIntyre. 

Stating this objection adequately is important to both understanding and critiquing MacIntyre. I argue that several of his critics misunderstand the dialectic and criticize errors MacIntyre agrees are errors, and errors he does not make. But even after clarifying the obscure points of the dialectic MacIntyre does endorse, the objection can be resolved but not finally refuted. Rather, the resolution of the criticism  can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves; hence MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the inquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the inquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that inquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the inquiry. 

#### Relativism Objection

Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] That of Susan Feldman misinterprets MacIntyre’s project as a (failed, incoherent) attempt to resolve factious, subjective ethical disputes by judging them from an abstract, objective, ideal observer. According to Lutz, MacIntyre accepts “relativity” as a condition of inquiry but denies “relativism” as the necessary conclusion of all inquiries. From the historically- and socially-situated position of inquiry, a philosopher (he argues) may indeed find truth.

Mendola assumes physicalism. 
He argues that Material Morality "comes as close to robust normativity as possible given physicalism."

He has an act-consequentialist, simple-desire based account. Other objectivist or hedonist accounts either "is inconsistent with physicalism or collapses into a desire-based view". "Ideal-desire" accounts are "plagued with indeterminacy." 

Consensus congruence, i.e., all or many people having the same preference, is reason giving.

            <Title>#### Incoherence of Tradition Objection</Title>
            <Text>#### Incoherence of the concept 'Tradition' Objection

Another, related, objection queries the concept of tradition through which, in part, MacIntyre defines virtue. This objections states that his tradition-constituted definition of rationality is self-contradictory. MacIntyre says on the one hand that, according to Tradition A, X is rational. According to Tradition B, X is not rational. They disagree and seem to genuinely disagree. A member of Tradition A can reasonably affirm that X cannot be both rational and irrational. Now, MacIntyre says that a member of Tradition B can discover some internal contradiction in Tradition B that makes her reconsider her tradition as aw hole. Perhaps she discovers that, according to Tradition B, Z is both rational and irrational. She is disconcerted by the contradiction. She decides to imaginatively entertain the possibility that Tradition A is more adequate and comes to see, over time, that Tradition A’s critique of Tradition B is compelling. The odd conclusion is this: affirming a contradiction is irrational for anyone in any Tradition. Now, I endorse this conclusion; if someone affirms a contradiction, and they persist in it in spite of repeated attempts to explain to them the contradiction, I would find them not just mistaken but fundamentally mentally impaired —  irrational. But the point is not whether the law of non-contradiction is true and a reliable criterion of rationality. The point is that MacIntyre cannot say so without contradicting himself. 

Suppose first that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational, while Tradition B teaches that logical contradictions can be rational. Then the member of Tradition B that affirms a contradiction (Z is both rational and irrational) will not, by her own standards, see a problem with her affirmation. A member of Tradition A will see the problem (by his own standards), but this is nothing surprising or new. The member of Tradition B has in principle no path out of her tradition, no motivation to see her tradition as mistaken, and hence no motivation to consider Tradition A. 

Suppose now that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational and Tradition B teaches the same. Now, according to MacIntyre, they agree (at least on this point) about a standard of rationality. They disagree about whether Z is rational or not, but they agree that Z cannot be both irrational and rational at the same time in the same respect. Are Tradition A and B now part of the same tradition, since they agree about the law of non-contradiction? Or are they different traditions, since they disagree about the rationality of Z? 

#### Incoherence of Tradition Objection Reply

I think it true that tradition influences our standards of rationality, justice, and virtue, but demonstrably false that it *constitutes* such standards. The law of non-contradiction is the counterexample. 

Every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction; every tradition denies rational agents the right to believe (P &amp; ~P). Any tradition that denies the law of non-contradiction, it seems to me, is an irrational tradition. And I don’t just intend to say it is irrational relative to my own standards of rationality, but that it is irrational full stop and possible to “step outside” my tradition far enough to see that. If there even does exist any person (such as Nagarjuna) or community or tradition that affirms (P &amp; ~P), we ought not interpret them as having a different standard of rationality but rather we ought to interpret them as believing that rationality is an obstacle to nirvana. Affirming contradictions is still irrational, but it is the kind of irrationality needed to do violence to the limits of rationality and transcend them. 

So I think MacIntyre’s unqualified claims about tradition constituting rationality should be limited to claims about other standards for acceptable kinds of evidence, etc.</Text>

            <Title>#### No Telos -- Metaphysical Biology Objection</Title>
            <Text>4. **No Telos — Metaphysical Biology Objection.** 

MacIntyre himself rejected Aristotle's "metaphysical biology" in *After Virtue*. He later changed his mind on this point. But critics might worry that the notion of social teleology is too bound up with discredited pre-modern notions about nature. 

### Metaphysical Biology Objection

MacIntyre's whole ethical case is built on the recovery of telos. Without telos, there can be no virtue. 

### We need telos for virtue because deontological virtues are too hard ##

He has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without telos becomes unintelligible. A society that highly values some virtue (say, chastity) but does so only out of habit --  without any wisp of certain knowledge about the effect chastity has on a man or woman's whole life --  will not long retain that high opinion. Chastity as a white-knuckle fiat not to engage in sexual intercourse with anyone other than one's opposite-sex spouse is simply too difficult, psychologically and morally, to seem valuable to someone who has no clue why chastity is so good for us, and why sexual license is so disastrous for humans, families, and societies. 

### Telos and virtue (and life, and self) are an organic whole ##

If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover telos. That is, we must discover or re-discover the organic holism of the narrative unity of my life, my identity and self-concept, the telos of human life as a species and my own specific telos as a member of that species, and the virtues that are the qualities that enable me to achieve my telos. Not one of these parts can be left out of the whole. 

### What if there are no ends in nature? ##

One powerful objection to the recovery of telos is that there is no teleology in nature. There are no *ends* (τελοι). Call this position *teleological nihilism.* There are two forms of teleological nihilism: extreme and moderate. Extreme teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no "purposes" or natural ends anywhere in the world *including* in human actions. Even our practices, behaviors, and lives are purposeless, even to ourselves. Moderate teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no natural purposes *except* those in human actions, intentions, and societies, etc. On moderate teleological nihilism, human purposes are not instances of a broader category that includes the tendency of an acorn to become an oak and the tendency of deer to survive and reproduce; human purposes are sui generis phenomena that spontaneously emerge out of our brains at a certain level of complexity. Final causation thinking is then projected out onto the world by us; we observe that the beaver gathered wood and that the beaver built a dam and we say "the beaver gathered wood *in order to* build the dam." But really the beaver did no such thing. This is what philosopher of biology Ernst Mayr calls "teleonomic" natural behavior, but not genuinely teleological.[@mayr1992teleology] 

Teleological nihilism claims as its evidence *modern science* as a whole. Natural sciences have dismissed the notion of final causation for three or four centuries now and have gotten along well without it. In fact, natural sciences and the experimental, empirical methods that advance them have progressed far more than anyone could have dreamed. In part, this success is the result of giving up magical thinking. 

### What if ends are reducible? ###

Teleoreductionism has taken one of two popular forms: the first reduces 'teleonomic' (that is, apparently teleological) biological functions to causal contributions to a system and the second reduces teleonomic biological functions to naturally selected effects. A proponent of the first reduction is Donald Davidson; a proponent of the second is Ruth Millikan. 

### Reducible reply ###

Neither forms of 'teleoreduction' can account for the normativity of the biological function in question. If hearts simply cause %%

James Barham elaborates:  I was aware of well-known criticisms of both of the then-current reductionist accounts of function: the "causal-role" theory and the Darwin-inspired "selected-effects" theory. In a nutshell, the problem is that neither theory can explain the normative character of biological processes in a coherent manner. (Biological processes are "normative" in the sense that they may either succeedor fail in fulfilling their functions.) With respect to the "causal-role" theory, there is no way to distinguish between functional and non-functional parts of a biological system without presupposing the normative character of the overall system as a whole -- which begs the question at issue.
With respect to the "selected-effects" theory, the problem is that selection history is conceptually irrelevant to the identification of function. True, it has a role to play in explaining how present-day functions have come to exist. But selection history cannot possibly explain what it is about a biological process that constitutes it as a function. This is a logical point that Darwinists simply miss. The reason is that our concept of function in no way depends on evolutionary history. If it did, then biologists like Aristotle, Galen, Harvey, and innumerable others who lived long before Darwin would not have had the means to identify the functions of organs, which they of course did. Sometimes, they got it wrong, as when Aristotle placed the seat of perception and thought in the heart, instead of the brain (though some of his predecessors got it right). But Aristotle's mistake was due to his inadequate knowledge of physiology, not to his ignorance of evolution."

Millikan bites the bullet on this objection. She isn't trying to do "conceptual analysis" of the term 'function.' She is willing to admit that her concept of proper function only applies to functional objects with histories and that hypothetical counterexamples involving functional objects without histories prove that two objects with one and the same "*mark* of purposiveness" can have different functions.[




### No Telos Reply ###

### Even if there were no natural teloi, human action is teleological

MacIntyre has a powerful response to this objection. It is, I think, satisfying. And that is that the conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology can be side-stepped. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups (the Republican or Democratic Party, the YMCA, the U.S.A., the Parent Teacher Association, Starbucks) is end-directed actions and practices. That is enough. Call it "social teleology." 

Christine Korsgaard has defended the notion of practical reason as the faculty we discover in ourselves *after* we are already acting in the world and reflecting upon our actions.[@korsgaard1996authority] It is not really up for debate that we are reflective creatures; everyone reading this is capable of reflecting on their actions, asking for and providing *reasons* for action that may or may not justify the action. This is close, I think, to MacIntyre's way of thinking. 

Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. Telos can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With telos firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether telos exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

### Human action is teleological

One thesis I would like to extract, develop, and defend is this: human practices are necessarily end-directed (teleological). “Social teleology” has at least two and possibly three aspects: individual, collective, and human. The first aspect of social teleology is the end-directed behavior of each agent; the second is the end-directed behavior of social groups, like families, nations, clubs, congregations, and so on. The third, and most objectionable, aspect, is the end-directed activity of our species as a whole. What, if anything, does every human being intentionally pursue? 

The answer to this question is bound to be controversial. But before we try to answer it we can pause and point out that MacIntyre has made the question intelligible and urgent. 

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. And if it is correct, it demands the re-evaluation of some cherished assumptions. 


### Biological Teleology

Teleological realism in biology is making a come-back. There are those who protest teleological nihilism. Arnhart persuasively argues that teleology is assumed in medicine.[@arnhart1988] Zammito clarifies ongoing relevance in biology, since organisms seem to be intrinsically purposeful.[@zammito2006teleology]


In a series of important articles and books over the past decade or so, Bedau (1990, 1992a, 1992b, 1993), Cameron (2004), Christensen &amp; Bickhard (2002), Jacobs (1986), Manning (1997), Maund (2000), McLaughlin (2001, 2009), Mossio et al. (2009), Mundale &amp; Bechtel (1996), Nanay (2010), Nissen (1997), Perovic (2007), Walsh (2006), and Zammito (2006) have cast grave doubt on the coherence of any reductive analysis of function. Some of these authors (e.g., Jacobs, Maund, Zammito) call explicitly for a reconsideration of the possibility that teleological phenomena in biology might be both objectively real and irreducible. 
The very word 'teleology' is liable to sound quaint to modern ears. Barnham clarifes the range of terms that denote identical or similar concepts: 

&gt;"By “teleology,” I have in mind such words and concepts as “purpose,” “end,” “goal,” “function,” “control,” and “regulation,” as well as the real- world biological phenomena to which these words and concepts refer. This means that the word “teleology” should always be construed here in its internal or “immanent” sense—purposiveness existing in living beings themselves—and never in its external or “transcendent” sense of an overarching cosmic principle" (Barnham 1). For a similar distinction, see Lennox (1992) and Brown (2001). 

We can add "purposive" and "goal-directed" to the constellation of concepts in the offing.

            <Text>##Rosalind Hursthouse

Rosalind Hursthouse has become, in recent years, the premier voice of virtue ethics. Dialoguing fluently not only with Aristotle but Plato and Kant, Hursthouse has synthesized much of John McDowell and Philippa Foot into her own original, articulate vision of a respectable modern virtue ethics. 

###Naturalism
Hursthouse’s account consists of a few interrelated and important theses: virtues benefit their possessor (Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics, Chapter 8). In the case of human virtue, the virtues are “those traits that human beings need to live well as human beings, to live a characteristically human life” (Hursthouse 192).  

But what is this characteristically human life? What is a human? 

In guiding action, virtue ethics appeals to the virtuous agent.

P.1. An action is right iff it is what a virtuous agent would characteristically (i.e. acting in character) do in the circumstances.
An objection is that P.1. suffers with respect to rival theories in failing to be action guiding or informative. But Hursthouse’s reply (which smacks of a tu quoque until we realize that ethical inquiry is hard for everyone) is that utilitarianism and deontology suffer in virtually the same respect. To make this clear, she rephrases the first premise. 
P.1. An action is right iff it is what an X agent would characteristically do in the circumstances.
To this, she adds: 
P.1a. An X agent is one who has and exercises certain character traits, namely the Xs.


  “The other first premises, taken strictly, are equally uninformative. We overlook this point because the utilitarian specifications of best consequences are so familiar, and all the deontologists we know cite familiar moral rules. But, for all that is said in the first premise of either, strange things might emerge in the second” (30). 

Hare would have it that 'good' was somehow functioning differently in ethical utterances than in phrases like 'the 2003 models have good enginges.' Hursthouse explains Foot's observation about attributive adjectives in this way: 
&gt;You can evaluate and choose things according to almost any criteria you like, you must select the noun or noun phrase you use to describe the thing you are calling good *advisedly*, for it determines the criteria of goodness that are appropriate. Hare can call a cactus a good one on the grounds that it is diseased and dying, and choose it for that reason, but what he must not do is describe it as a good *cactus*, for a cactus is a living thing. He can describe it as a good ‘decorative object for my windowsill’ or ‘present to give my detestable mother‐in‐law’, but not as a good cactus. And it was part and parcel of what used to be thought of as Foot's ‘naturalism’ in ethics that, following Anscombe in ‘Modern Moral Philosophy’, she denied that this grammatical feature of the word ‘good’ and its related terms suddenly underwent a mysterious change when we started doing ethics. What goes for ‘good cactus’, ‘good knife’, ‘good rider’, also goes for ‘good human being’ even when we use that phrase in ethics (195). 


### Hursthouse on Naturalism?
“Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism—broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being” (Hursthouse 193). But the question is whether “human nature” is purely descriptive set of properties, ranges, relations, etc., or includes normative content from the outset.  As Hursthouse summarizes the worry: “Ethical naturalism hopes to validate beliefs about which character traits are virtues by appeal to human nature, and this may seem a vain hope. For either we speak from the neutral point of view, using a scientific account of human nature—in which case we won't get very far—or we speak from within an acquired ethical outlook—in which case we will not validate our ethical beliefs, but merely re‐express them” (Hursthouse 193). 

Her path through the horns of this dilemma is the one blazed by John McDowell. Ethical inquiry is neither scientific in the sense that we must start with a neutral 3rd-personal point of view to attain “objectivity” nor is it foundational in that we must start “from within” the 1st-personal point of view, using a core proposition or set of propositions whose truth is certain and unproblematic and working out from there. Rater, within an ethical outlook we modify our ethical outlook. It is the ship of Neurath. 

“This chapter aims [give] some fairly specific details of how, in naturalistic terms, I might set about finding the rational credentials for my beliefs about which character traits are the virtues” (Hursthouse 194). 


How naturalistic is this virtue ethic? [I have argued that we cannot simply adopt the title for social reasons if we deny the majority view of what nature is.] How Aristotelian is neo-Aristotelianism? We ought not expect that every jot and tittle of Aristotle be preserved as sacred, but we ought to expect that some of Aristotle’s own core commitments overlap with a neo-Aristotelian’s core commitment. 

R. Scott Smith argues that MacIntyre’s virtue ethics assumes realism (Smith, Virtue Ethics and Moral Knowledge). Without the assumption, it loses coherence. 

An objection is that P.1. suffers with respect to rival theories in failing to be action guiding or informative. But Hursthouse’s reply (which smacks of a tu quoque until we realize that ethical inquiry is hard for everyone) is that utilitarianism and deontology suffer in virtually the same respect. To make this clear, she rephrases the first premise. 
P.1. An action is right iff it is what an X agent would characteristically do in the circumstances.
To this, she adds:

We overlook this point because the utilitarian specifications of best consequences are so familiar, and all the deontologists we know cite familiar moral rules. But, for all that is said in the first premise of either, strange things might emerge in the second” (30). 

“Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism—broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being” (Hursthouse 193).

The suggestion here that we cannot understand ‘courageous act’ (‘honest act’, ‘loyal act’, ‘temperate act’, ‘charitable act’, etc.) until we have (so to speak) got our hands on the exemplar, the agent with the virtuous character, is an assertion of the ‘primacy of character’ with a vengeance.

So where do I stand on the ‘primacy of character’? For a start, I need a phrase which explicitly disavows any foundational or reductivist (p.83) role for it, so I shall say I subscribe to the thesis that the concept of the virtuous agent is the focal concept of ethics. Then, summing up the preceding discussion, I shall say that by this I mean, at least, that we need it to understand both action guidance and action assessment, to understand why it is sometimes so difficult to see what should be done and why we accept advice, to understand irresolvable and tragic dilemmas and the unity of the virtues, and to fine‐tune, and thereby fully understand, our virtue and vice concepts.

One question that has been begged here is just what we find the world to be like, for instance the question of whether or not we find it to be a world of God's making. It is often assumed that deontology is the only possible normative ethics for a theist, but this squares ill with the fact that Aquinas, Anscombe, and Geach are all virtue ethicists rather than deontologists. They all regard ‘Do not lie’ as an absolute prohibition, and, accordingly, would deny much of the above. For a start they would, I take it, deny that the virtue of honesty was consistent with telling white lies; someone who is scrupulous about telling the truth in other contexts is not dishonest the way someone who will lie whenever it suits her is, but is still failing in honesty. The rule ‘Do not lie’ is sacrosanct, and it is not a mistake to think that one lie leads to another; getting into the habit of telling small social lies ‘corrupts our practical wisdom’.

One of Hume's most instructive mistakes is his conviction that he can dismiss ‘celibacy, fasting and the other monkish virtues’ without (p.243) making any assumptions about ‘the end of man’. Of course he cannot. He can dismiss them only if he assumes that human nature is as conceived by atheists and that thereby ‘the end(s) of man’ are given by ethical naturalism rather than supernaturalism. For the monkish virtues (supposing them to be agreeable neither to their possessor nor to others) are not shown to be useless tout court by showing that they are of no use to their possessor or to others in this life, on the assumption that there is no God. They are traditionally recommended as being ‘useful’ for bringing one closer to God in this life and as preparing one's soul for the life hereafter.

All we need by way of ethics can be grounded in facts about the natural world as ‘the province of scientific understanding’ (MVR: 182), including, e.g. facts about ‘what animals of a particular species need in order to do well in the sort of life they naturally live’ (MVR: 176). (This is actually a form of naturalism that Philippa Foot comes quite close to exemplifying.) This form of naturalism, in fact, has the same narrow conception of nature as many subjectivist non-naturalists but differs from them in claiming that an understanding of the animal side of human nature can give us sufficient direct ethical guidance without the additional intervention of some personal act of prescribing or endorsing which can be performed or withheld at will.

McDowell refers to a naturalism based on this richer conception of nature as an ‘acceptable naturalism’ (MVR: 197), a ‘relaxed naturalism’ (MW: 89) and a ‘liberal naturalism’ (: 98). He often introduces it by reflecting on Aristotle's account of the virtues, and he refers to it as ‘Greek naturalism’ (MVR: 174), ‘Aristotelian naturalism’ (MVR: 196), ‘naturalism of second nature’ (MW: 86), or ‘naturalized platonism’ (MW: 91). The richer conception of nature behind this sort of naturalism is also called a ‘partial re-enchantment of nature’ (MW: 97) though there is clearly meant to be nothing supernatural about it.

Such a ninth conception of nature would be an unrestricted conception. It would express the idea that there is one world only, and that that world is the realm of nature, which is taken to include the cultural, artificial, mental, abstract and whatever else there may prove to be. There are no realms above or beyond nature. To be is to be in nature and to be in continuity with everything else in nature. Even the greatest and deepest differences are differences within nature rather than differences between nature and something else.

The Athenian doesn't just leave the concept physis to the ‘men of science’. He does not first accept their conception of nature and then confront them with the claim that there is something extra-natural—the soul or the gods—which they have disregarded and which is in fact prior to nature. No. Like McDowell the Athenian is eager to have nature on his side. He therefore challenges the scientists' right to restrict the term ‘nature’ to the soulless, partly necessary and partly accidental combinations of the elements.

- Highlight Loc. 335-42  | Added on Wednesday, April 22, 2015, 05:51 PM

With reference to Plato and Aristotle I have characterized two sorts of contrasting or restricted conceptions of nature, a materialist and an idealist. Each of them could be seen as underlying a sort of naturalism in ethics or in other branches of philosophy. The materialist conception of nature is at the root of bald, empiricist naturalism and of the many different modern forms of naturalism that let one or other interpretation of the results of present day science define what belongs to nature and what not. (A materialist conception of nature is also being taken for granted by most forms of non-naturalism, whether subjectivist or super-naturalist). The idealist conception of nature is at the root of the natural law tradition of naturalism that is still alive. The philosophical impulse behind both these sorts of naturalism is to see the ethical in continuity rather than discontinuity with nature understood as that which is most primary in existence and most objective in experience. They just happen to disagree about what that is.

McDowell has convincingly shown that what Bernard Williams calls the absolute conception of reality is merely restricted, bald naturalism ideologically presented as absolute (MVR: 112–31, esp. sect. 5). Nothing less than a naturalism that deserves to be presented as absolute could help break the spell of bald naturalism without merely replacing one restricted sort of naturalism with another and thus keeping the oscillations going.

Must it not quite generally be the case that anyone who ‘finds it hard’ to help another possesses only the inferior, ‘continent’ form of this virtue? No, for here we come to one of Kant's (p.98) philanthropists, the one whose mind is ‘overclouded by sorrows of his own’. To say of him, when he does what is charitable, with difficulty and without pleasure, that he thereby acts less well, or shows himself to be less perfect in the virtue of charity, than someone else who does the same gladly, would be a mistake, for what ‘makes it hard’ for him to act well here does not show that his virtue is incomplete.

We should not forget that Kant and Aristotle significantly share a strongly anti‐Humean premise about the principles or springs of movement (or ‘action’ in the broad sense of the term). According to Hume, there is only one principle of action, the one we share with animals, namely passion or desire; according to both Aristotle and Kant there are two, one which we share with the other animals, and (p.103) one which we have in virtue of being rational. Of course we all know that the ideal Kantian agent acts from a sense of duty, not from inclination, but if ‘inclination’ is that‐principle‐of‐movement‐we‐share‐with‐the‐other‐animals, then the virtuous Aristotelian agent doesn't act from inclination either, but from reason ( logos) in the form of ‘choice’ (prohairesis).

Tradition offers us a few alternatives. We might say that the fifth end was the preparation of our souls for the life hereafter, or that it was contemplation—the good functioning of the theoretical intellect. But to adopt the first is to go beyond naturalism towards supernaturalism, and even philosophers have baulked at following Aristotle and endorsing the second.

So if ethical naturalism depends on identifying what is characteristic of human beings as a species in the way their pleasures and pains and ways of going on are characteristic of the other species, it looks doomed to failure. ‘The way’ human beings live varies enormously from place to place, from time to time, from one to (p.220) another. When we look at the other species, although we do find regional and temporal variety (for instance, between the town‐dwelling and country‐dwelling members of those species of creatures that have fairly recently taken up doing both) and some idiosyncrasies, the variation in us is of quite a different order.

Ethical naturalism looks to be doomed to failure if it depends on identifying what is characteristic of human beings as a species, in the way their pleasures and pains and ways of going on are characteristic of the other species. By and large we can't identify what is characteristic of human beings as a species in this way—there is too much variety. And even if we could, it looks as though we would not allow anything we identified to carry any normative weight if we thought it was something we could change. So is ethical naturalism, after all, a non‐starter?

Not yet, for there is a standard claim to the effect that there is something characteristic of human beings, that we do have a characteristic way of going on, but not in the way that is true of the other animals. Their characteristic ways of going on are many and have to be described in detailed terms, specifically related to such things as the acquisition of nourishment, mating, feeding the young, hunting, selecting leaders, etc., and are discovered by observation. Our way of going on is just one, which remains the same across all areas of our life. Our characteristic way of going on, which distinguishes us from all the other species of animals, is a rational way. A ‘rational way’ is any way that we can rightly see as good, as something we have reason to do. Correspondingly, our characteristic enjoyments are any enjoyments we can rightly see as good, as something we in fact enjoy and that reason can rightly endorse.

The question is, admittedly, wildly speculative, but on the face of it, it rather looks as though the species and familial bonding that are part of our biological, animal nature, and make us ‘partial’ to our own species and children, play an essential role in sustaining these two ends. This is not to lapse back into resting content with our nature as we find it, not to deny that we could reshape our nature in such a way that we no longer (p.226) cared particularly about our own species and children. Maybe we could. It is to draw attention to the fact that, with respect to the continuance of the species and the good functioning of the social group, our natural tendency to bond to other human beings and our children seems to be serving us rather well. The onus is on those who recommend impersonal benevolence as a virtue to provide at least a speculation about how a species of rational animals who had brought themselves to care naught for their own children or each other's company might still be a species of social animals who, moreover, nurtured their young—and, indeed, went to the trouble of giving them a moral education and bringing them up to be impersonally benevolent in their turn.

Ethical naturalism, in the context of virtue ethics, aims to capture Anscombe's and Foot's idea that, when we talk about ethically good human beings, we have not suddenly started to use the word ‘good’ in a totally new ‘moral’ or ‘evaluative’ way. There is a structure (not necessarily of the sort I have outlined, but some structure) in the botanical and ethological evaluations of other living things as good or defective specimens of their kind, which supervenes on evaluations of their parts and behaviour as good or defective in the light of certain ends, and this carries over (mutatis mutandis) into evaluations of ourselves as ethically good or bad as human beings in respect of our characters. Moreover, in preserving the structure (and hence the four ends appropriate to social animals), the particular subject matter has been kept ‘natural’; we evaluate ourselves as a natural kind, a species which is part of the natural biological order of things, not as creatures with an immortal soul or ‘beings’ who are persons or rational agents. And, so far, the ethical and the non‐ethical evaluations are analogous. However, they are also disanalogous. For a start, according to (p.227) the form of ethical naturalism I am defending, what is particularly evaluated are character traits, not, directly, actions or lives. (I have found, in discussion, that this is a point that can hardly be emphasized too often.)

In the last chapter (pp. 202–5 above) I listed five points ‘worth noting’ about the evaluations of other living things. The first was that the truth of such evaluations did not depend in any way on my wants, interests, or values, nor indeed on ‘ours’. They are ‘objective’ in the most straightforward sense of the term. Indeed, I added, given that botany, ethology, etc. are sciences, they are scientific. The fifth was that the truth of the overall evaluation depends in part upon the needs and (as we ascend the ladder of nature) the interests and desires of the xs in question. Do these two claims remain true of our evaluations of ourselves?

the conclusions of ethical naturalism do not depend on our interests and desires because they are arrived at from within an ethical outlook.

Alongside teaching children the personal benefits they can expect to derive from being e.g. honest, we point out some of the things in their social life that honesty sustains such as (depending on their age and circumstances) their being able to leave things in their school desks, getting reliable directions, the school library (with its amnesty day for returns), acquiring qualifications and references.

Now virtue ethics certainly denies one sort of objectivity to ethics, namely the sort of objectivity that Kant aspires to. In the version I am defending, it denies another sort too. The sorts of facts it appeals to are not all ‘empirical’ and accessible from ‘a neutral point of view’. The long‐term naturalistic project of validating the standard list of the virtues is Neurathian, and proceeds from within our ethical outlook. It is not a matter of reading the standard list off the book of nature as if human nature and our characteristic ways of going on were brute givens. But neither is it a matter of deciding in advance that our standard list is the correct one. Whether it is correct will be discovered when we discover the extent to which we can give a coherent account of the roles the character traits on the list play in our lives, an account that coheres not merely with our ethical outlook but with all the empirical and other facts that we bring into play. This seems to me to be enough to count as objectivity—not a priori or scientific objectivity—but a kind of objectivity appropriate to the subject matter.

The first proviso concerns the universality of the claim that all discussions of objectivity in ethics which do not come to nothing come back to the proper understanding of ethical disagreement. Might one not say that, even if everyone agreed on some particular ethical judgement, there would still be room for the thought, ‘Why do I/we believe this? Can I/we give any grounds for it, and, if so, what are they? Might I/we be wrong, and, if so, how could I/we find out?’ (In my experience, what leads many beginning students to despair of any objectivity in aesthetics is not a worry about people who might disagree with their belief that Shakespeare's or Mozart's productions are great works of art (for they are often sitting in classes where everyone does agree), but the discovery of their own inability to say anything about why they believe this, beyond ‘Oh, but the plays/the music are just so wonderful!’)

But, as has already been admitted, we do not have ‘characteristic ways, etc.’ laid down by nature, or at least, nothing like enough to guarantee that character traits which ‘apparently’ conduce well to two of the ends and ill to the others can always be dismissed as resulting in what is ‘uncharacteristic’. So there really is a question, in our case, ‘Mightn't the four ends fall apart? And where would the naturalistic criterion for virtue be then?’ And the bold claim embodied in thesis (3) is, in effect, ‘Don't worry, they can't. Given human nature, thesis (1) and thesis (2) are interrelated; given human nature, the four ends of naturalism cannot fall apart.’ (Just as we can see a hint of the threat of serious conflict in the advocate of self‐control (p.251) with respect to sex, we can see the hint of the bold advocacy of thesis (3) in the advocate of real temperance. The former says, ‘Well, I know there's a bit of a conflict between the conducing to the third end and the others, but overall, given the constraints nature imposes on us, self‐control is a virtue.’ The latter says, ‘There isn't any conflict. Given human nature, as both sexual and rational, we can achieve harmony between our sexual desires and our reason and acquire a character trait that conduces without conflict to all four ends.’) According to thesis (3), human nature, quite generally, is such that we can develop character traits that meet the two criteria given in theses (1) and (2). ‘We have the virtues neither by nor contrary to [our] nature,’ Aristotle says, ‘ we are fitted by [our] nature to receive them.’ If we had the virtues by nature, then moral education would be unnecessary. If we had them contrary to nature, we would not enjoy their exercise at all, and other aspects of our nature would war against them even if we did enjoy their exercise. To say ‘we are fitted by nature to receive them’, by contrast, is to say that, having acquired them through the sort of moral education and self‐improvement appropriate to rational social animals, we can enjoy their exercise and that other aspects of our morally educated, ‘second’, nature will not still contain recalcitrant aspects at war with our enjoyment of their exercise. They ‘suit us’, as I have heard Philippa Foot say. It does not just happen to be the case that those character traits which benefit their human possessor, enabling her to live a satisfying and fulfilling life, coincide with those character traits which are the good‐making characteristics of human beings. They benefit her in this way because of her nature as a human being, the sort of rational social animal that human beings are.

The oldest objection to it in our tradition comes from Plato himself, put into the mouths of his characters Glaucon, Adimantus, and Thrasymachus in the Republic. Although nowadays a Thrasymachus ‘figure’ will often be used to represent the imagined view of the wicked mafioso drug baron challenging us to provide him with a motivating reason for being virtuous, this is not quite how the characters appear in Plato. They do not just dig in their toes over their personal values or desires; they advance a particular claim about human nature. The claim is that human nature is, biologically, so intrinsically egoistic that a ‘conventional’ moral upbringing which inculcates the virtues as second nature distorts and perverts it, producing defective human beings instead of good ones.

Serious consideration of Nietzschean views does not leave the outlook unchanged, for we may find ourselves led to modify our concepts of, for instance, compassion and justice somewhat, and to take seriously (in a way naturalism has anticipated when it noted the division of labour amongst other animals) the fact that there are some exceptional individuals we commonly admire. Quite aside from the question of what we should say about them if their admirability coincides with their possession of at least some of the vices (the Gaugin problem), there is the question of what we should say about them even if they are free from any such taint. Are they the best human beings, head and shoulders above all the rest of us, notwithstanding the fact that not even all the most virtuous (by the standard list) amongst us can aspire to being exceptional in (p.255) comparable ways? Or are they, like the best amongst the rest of us, unusually good qua human beings, though not in the standard way (supposing them to be not particularly well endowed with some of the virtues)? (And if so, does someone who is capable of being unusually good in either the standard or the non‐standard way have reason to choose one way rather than the other?) Or are they (supposing them to be as well endowed as the best of the rest of us) unusually good qua human beings and also great artists, or leaders, or statesmen, or whatever?

From early on, Williams has expressed pessimism about the project of Aristotelian naturalism on the grounds that Aristotle's conception of nature, and thereby human nature, was normative, and that, in a scientific age, this is not a conception that we can take on board. In both Morality and Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy this was supported in ways that made it look very much like an objection that encapsulated some of those I have considered—that nowadays we hold no truck with nature as we find it, that we know we do not have characteristic ways of going on because we know so much about cultural variation, and so on. It also looked like an objection that encapsulated a more abstract one—that Aristotle's conception of nature is teleological, whereas our modern, scientific one is not. And all this looked as though it could be defused by claiming that the project was not to be conceived of as, in any ordinary understanding of the terms, either ‘scientific’ or ‘foundational’, by pointing out that the ethical evaluations the naturalism (we hoped) yielded were never supposed to be strictly analogous to the (p.257) deliverances of biology/ethology.

He identified this as follows. Speaking of reasons against ethical naturalism, he says: The second and more general reason lies not in the particular ways in which human beings may have evolved, but simply in the fact that they have evolved, and by natural selection. The idea of a naturalistic ethics was born of a deeply teleological outlook, and its best expression, in many ways, is still to be found in Aristotle's philosophy, a philosophy according to which there is inherent in each natural kind of thing an appropriate way for things of that kind to behave. On that view it must be the deepest desire—need?—purpose?—satisfaction?—of human beings to live in the way that is in this objective sense appropriate to them (the fact that modern words break up into these alternatives expresses the modern break‐up of Aristotle's view). Other naturalistic views, Marxist and some which indeed call themselves ‘evolutionary’, have often proclaimed themselves free from any such picture, but it is basically very hard for them to avoid some appeal to an implicit teleology, an order in relation to which there could be an existence which would satisfy all the most basic human needs at once. The first and hardest lesson of Darwinism, that there is no such teleology at all, and that there is no orchestral score provided from anywhere according to which human beings have a special part to play, still has to find its way into ethical thought. One thing this passage draws to our attention is that the non‐ethical evaluations of living things that I have outlined are ‘Aristotelian’ rather than Darwinian. They do, as I have been at pains to emphasize, rely on the idea that there is, in relation to each natural kind of thing, ‘an appropriate (= characteristic) way for (p.258) things of that kind to behave’ in relation to which they are evaluated as good or defective. The evaluations do not—as they might in a post‐Darwinian age—evaluate members of species of living things simply as good, or not so good, or downright defective, as replicators of their genes.

suspicion at Williams's suggestion that the idea that human nature is not harmonious ‘still has to find itself into ethical thought’. The suggestion is that this is a new idea—‘the first and hardest lesson of Darwinism’. But it seems to me to be a very old one, as old as misanthropy and despair—as Williams himself suggests in another passage. The most plausible evolutionary stories currently available, he says, suggest that human beings are to some degree a mess, and that the rapid and immense development of symbolic and cultural capacities has left humans as beings for whom no form of life is likely to prove entirely satisfactory, either individually or socially. Many of course have come to that conclusion before, and those who have tried to reach a naturalistic morality which transcends it have had to read the historical record, or read beyond the historical record, in ways that seek to reveal a partly hidden human nature which is waiting to be realised or perfected. The evolutionary story, to the extent that it can now be understood (and to the much more modest extent to which I understand it myself) seems to me to give some support to the view that in this respect the historical story means much what it looks as though it means. Now I don't know about ‘many’ but I am sure that some people, long before Darwin, have looked at the dismal course of human history and reached the conclusion that human beings are just a mess.

with all of them. Any human being who, at the end of her life, is able to look back and say, sincerely, ‘That was satisfactory; I lived well’, has been astonishingly lucky, and no inculcation of character traits, no supposedly rational plan of one's life or attempts at supposed self‐improvement or supposed improvement of our societies can make anyone one whit more likely to be lucky; all such attempts are futile. There is no point in looking for a set of character traits that benefit their possessor, and no point in looking for a set of character traits which are the good‐making characteristics of human beings. There aren't any. Expressed in these terms, the view amounts to complete moral nihilism. (Note that even Kant and utilitarianism will be affected by this pessimism, since we cannot be required to adopt the happiness of others as an end, or its maximization, if happiness comes only through astonishing luck.) The belief that harmony is possible for human beings, that we have the virtues neither by nor contrary to nature, but are fitted by (our) nature to receive them, is, I think, an essential part of the ethical outlook even of the minimally virtuous—any of us who think that being right about ethics matters. We manifest it when we try to inculcate the virtues in our children. We manifest it when we try to make ourselves (as we think) better people and try to improve our own and other people's ethical views. We manifest it when we try to bring about social change.

We read it as arising from greed, injustice, callousness, selfishness, folly, intolerance, overweening ambition, licentiousness, cowardice—and the defect (which I think myself Aristotle rightly identified as opposed to megalopsuchia, ‘greatness of soul’) through which ‘good men do nothing’. Of course such a reading is not available from a neutral point of view. But what we should be struck by is that it is available, from within the ethical outlook, supported by a mass of details which cannot just be dismissed as mere myth‐making nor shown to be such by some vague appeal to Darwinism.

Atheists may find it hard to recognize the point nowadays, but believing that human nature is harmonious is part of the virtue of (p.265) hope. Something at least very like it used to be called belief in (God's) Providence; to believe in Providence was part of the virtue of hope; to doubt it is to fall prey to the vice of despair. And that seems to me to be right. To view oneself and one's fellow human beings as, by nature, battlegrounds between passion and reason, or self‐interest and sociality (or an unholy combination of both), so that there is no hope of human beings' living well, ever, however much theoretical and practical rationality we exercise now and hope to pass on to future generations, is a counsel of despair. But hope, as a virtue, is not without its own validation. We could give it a sort of ‘necessary condition of our practice’ justification. The practice of the natural sciences, it might be said, has to be based on the non‐scientifically validated assumption that nature is intelligible; if we suppose it is not, the whole practice collapses. And we know there is no refutation of scepticism about that assumption. But the practice is worth going in for, there is no practicable alternative for us, so we have to take the assumption on board. Analogously, the practice of ethical thought, as we know it, has to be based on the assumption that human beings, as a species, are capable of harmony, both within themselves and with each other. If we suppose they are not, the whole practice collapses. There is no refutation of scepticism about this assumption. But the practice is worth going in for, there is no practicable alternative for us, so we have to take the assumption on board. </Text>

3.5 The objects of demarcation Various proposals have been put forward on exactly what elements in science or pseudoscience criteria of demarcation should be applied to. Proposals include that the demarcation should refer to a research program (Lakatos 1974a, 248–249), an epistemic field or cognitive discipline, i.e. a group of people with common knowledge aims, and their practices (Bunge 1982, 2001; Mahner 2007), a theory (Popper 1962, 1974), a practice (Lugg 1992; Morris 1987), a scientific problem or question (Siitonen 1984), and a particular inquiry (Kuhn 1974; Mayo 1996). It is probably fair to say that demarcation criteria can be meaningfully applied on each of these levels of description. A much more difficult problem is whether one of these levels is the fundamental level to which assessments on the other levels are reducible.

Hence, after showing that creationism is in some respects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th century, one author maintained that “if such an activity was describable as science then, there is a cause for describing it as science now” (Dolby 1987, 207). This argument is based on a fundamental misconception of science. It is an essential feature of science that it methodically strives for improvement through empirical testing, intellectual criticism, and the exploration of new terrain. A standpoint or theory cannot be scientific unless it relates adequately to this process of improvement, which means as a minimum that well-founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are accepted. The demarcation of science cannot be timeless, for the simple reason that science itself is not timeless.

Nevertheless, the mutability of science is one of the factors that renders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult. Derkson (1993, 19) rightly pointed out three major reasons why demarcation is sometimes difficult: science changes over time, science is heterogenous, and established science itself is not free of the defects characteristic of pseudoscience.

criterion for a scientific theory or hypothesis to be scientific, rather than pseudoscientific or metaphysical. Instead he proposed as a criterion that the theory be falsifiable, or more precisely that “statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations” (Popper 1962, 39). Popper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between statements belonging to the empirical sciences and “all other statements – whether they are of a religious or of a metaphysical character, or simply pseudoscientific” (Popper 1962, 39; cf. Popper 1974, 981). It was both an alternative to the logical positivists’ verification criteria and a criterion for distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. Although Popper did not emphasize the distinction, these are of course two different issues (Bartley 1968). Popper conceded that metaphysical statements may be “far from meaningless” (1974, 978–979) but showed no such appreciation of pseudoscientific statements.

However, even logical falsifiability can create problems in practical demarcations. Popper once adopted the view that natural selection is not a proper scientific theory, arguing that it comes close to only saying that “survivors survive”, which is tautological. “Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program” (Popper 1976, 168). This statement has been criticized by evolutionary scientists who pointed out that it misrepresents evolution. The theory of natural selection has given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in field studies and in laboratory settings (Ruse 1977; 2000).

In a lecture in Darwin College in 1977, Popper retracted his previous view that the theory of natural selection is tautological. He now admitted that it is a testable theory although “difficult to test” (Popper 1978, 344). However, in spite of his well-argued recantation his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in defiance of the accumulating evidence from empirical tests of natural selection.

4.4 Criteria based on scientific progress Popper's demarcation criterion concerns the logical structure of theories. Imre Lakatos described this criterion as “a rather stunning one. A theory may be scientific even if there is not a shred of evidence in its favour, and it may be pseudoscientific even if all the available evidence is in its favour. That is, the scientific or non-scientific character of a theory can be determined independently of the facts” (Lakatos 1981, 117).

In a somewhat similar vein, Daniel Rothbart (1990) emphasized the distinction between the standards to be used when testing a theory and those to be used when determining whether a theory should at all be tested. The latter, the eligibility criteria, include that the theory should encapsulate the explanatory success of its rival, and that it should yield testable implications that are inconsistent with those of the rival. According to Rothbart, a theory is unscientific if it is not testworthy in this sense.

5. Unity in diversity Kuhn observed that although his own and Popper's criteria of demarcation are profoundly different, they lead to essentially the same conclusions on what should be counted as science respectively pseudoscience (Kuhn 1974, 803). This convergence of theoretically divergent demarcation criteria is a quite general phenomenon. Philosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their views on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in the community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of demarcation. There is widespread agreement for instance that creationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing, ufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian catastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences. There are a few points of controversy, for instance concerning the status of Freudian psychoanalysis, but the general picture is one of consensus rather than controversy in particular issues of demarcation.

Philosophical reflection on pseudoscience has brought forth other interesting problem areas in addition to the demarcation between science and pseudoscience. Examples include related demarcations such as that between science and religion, the relationship between science and reliable non-scientific knowledge (for instance everyday knowledge), the scope for justifiable simplifications in science education and popular science, the nature and justification of methodological naturalism in science (Boudry et al 2010), and the meaning or meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural phenomenon. Several of these problem areas have as yet not received much philosophical attention.

se two divisions of theory of reality or metaphysics. Materialism is distinctly an onto- logical theory, a theory of the stuff of reality. Its polar opposite is usually taken to be mentalism of some kind. Naturalism, on the other hand, is a cosmological position; its opposite is super- naturalism in the larger meaning of that term. I mean that naturalism takes nature in a definite way as identical with reality, as self-sufficient and as the whole of reality. And by nature is meant the space-time-causal system which is studied by science and in which our lives are passed. The whole nature of nature may not be exhaustively

above I have employed the term naturalism as the logical term for my position. In that I have stressed novelty and gradients in nature I have called it evolutionary naturalism. Undeniably there are other species of naturalism resting upon a different epistemology. Thus there is the pragmatic kind of naturalism with its beloved word experience. I am quite ready to acknowledge that there is much in the drift and tendency of pragmatism with which I have sympathy; and yet the neglect of epistemology and the almost complete lack of cosmology debar me from anything but a very general feeling of kinship. It still strikes me as a pseudo-naturalism, an outlook which is too much of a holdover from idealism to represent the nature of common sense and science. Panpsychism is another species of naturalism which cannot be ignored. At one time, it was the expression of Kantian phenomenalism and was well under the control of ideal- istic motives-as witness James Ward's and Mr. Carr's revival of monadism-but in the hands of Professors Strong and Drake the naturalistic perspective has come to the front.

The critical realism which underlies evolutionary naturalism precludes the appeal to a neutral, semi-experiential stuff which can be taken alternately as mental and physical according to context.

I am frank to confess that some of the extrinsic weaknesses of materialism have followed from intrinsic weak- nesses.

In the strict sense, in short, matter is only a part of a material system. There is energy; there is the fact of pattern; there are all sorts of intimate relations. There has been, in other words, something of the abstract and reductive about our thought of matter and of material systems. There is heterogeneity, qualitative diversity in the material world.

            <Text>##McDowell's critique of empirical ethics in bald naturalism
The critique we find in McDowell is the "just too different" point. Bald naturalism, as a realm of unbroken and perhaps unbreakable law, is just too different from the space of reasons. 

McDowell agrees about Foot's rejection of supernaturalism and of naturalistic subjectivism. [@mcdowell.mvr]



#John McDowell’s View from Somewhere, and Intersubjective Norms of Reason and Practical Reason

##Introduction

Richard Bernstein calls John McDowell’s naturalism a much needed “novel twist” on the stalemate between those who think naturalism will eventually make good on its promise to naturalize reason and those who are sick of waiting and ready to give up. 

He quotes Joseph Margolis and Mark Gottlieb as saying that: 

Naturalism in the current analytic sense may well be the dominant programmatic orientation of Anglo-American philosophy. It may be characterized as an informally linked family of doctrines and strategies broadly in accord with 'ancestral' themes of W. V. O. Quine's "Epistemology Naturalized." The original themes feature in Quine include: a preference for physicalism of one sort or another, a strong emphasis on the continuity of science and philosophy, particularly at the explanatory level, and the effective replacement of legitimative inquiries of a typically noncausal sort by causal inquiries centering on belief." (Berstein 58) 

The "specter of Kant keeps surfacing in thinkers like Putnam and Habermas who are convinced that reason cannot be naturalized" (Berstein 59). The "novel twist" comes from John McDowell. Berstein says that “at first glance, it seems that McDowell fits right into the tradition of Kantian anti-naturalism — a tradition that runs from Kant right up to Putnam and Habermas” since he thinks “reason can’t be naturalized” (Bernstein 62). But his arguments, Berstein thinks, against bald naturalism amount to some sophisticated question-begging via sleight of hand. Even so, when we look at particular “first order claims


##John McDowell

###Mind and World
The “oscillation” between two false and fearful alternatives is the backdrop against which McDowell’s unique beliefs about mind and world come to light. 


John McDowell shares with Thomas Nagel a radical lack of curiosity about the metaphysics — that is, the traditional metaphysics — of morality. As a type of Kantian, he doesn’t think such answers are possible to find and so such questions not much worth asking. 
Second nature is the key concept for John McDowell. Second nature is that realm of human intersubjectivity wherein we are sensitive to reasons (that is, reasons for thinking and reasons for acting). Bald nature is not sensitive to reasons. Supernature, hypothetically, would be but is not natural and so is spooky.

            <Text>#### The human function
So what about human beings *qua* species? Forget my individual telos for a moment. When we examine the function of any old item of human life, say, a knife, we see that it cuts. 
&gt;What is the purpose of cutting vegetables? To prepare them for cooking. Why prepare vegetables for cooking? So we can eat them. What is the purpose of eating? so we can go on living. The series could stop there, but one could continue on and ask what the purpose in living is. In that we confront an existential question. (Brown 31-32)
He briefly considers just ending the series by repeating the last answer: we eat in order to keep living, and we live in order to keep living -- the end. He also considers that the question loses its species-indexed meaning at this point and becomes member-indexed -- what is *my* purpose.


Is there teleology in nature? Are some natural causes final causes? Are final causes natural? 

Brown distinguishes four kinds of teleology: two agent-centered kinds and two others. The first is intentional actions, the second artifacts. The third is formal teleology, the fourth functional. 

Number  Type   Name    Definition Example
1. 1.1 Intentional Doing something for a reason. Bob jumped to beat the world record.
2. 1.2 Artefactual Making something for a reason. Bettie designed the bridge to withstand earthquakes. Jimmy made a knork for cutting and stabbing meat.

3. 2.1 Formal A thing's structure or organization serving some purpose. A knee joint allows for both motion and static rest. A sharp tooth is sharp in order to be able to puncture, pin, and scratch. 
4. 2.2 Functional A thing's activity serves some purpose. A running animal can catch prey or flee from predeators in order to survive. </Text>

            <Text>Hi Dr. Bradshaw,

I'm wondering if you have some time to sit down in the next couple of weeks and talk about dissertation direction. 

The thought hit me pretty hard two weeks ago that I might want to adjust my research direction towards naturalism, specifically ethics and philosophy of mind. 

Here's my thinking. I've wanted to and planned to study ancient at a professional academic level since 2005. My two heroes from that season of life were Platonists. I read a lot of Plato, Plotinus, Proclus, as well as some classic scholarship like Conford, J.A. Stewart, and others. I did and still consider Plato my "master" when it comes to thinking, teaching, and dialoguing. It just made sense. I haven't read as much of the secondary scholarship as I will need to, of course, but there is time for that in the coming years. 

Two things changed. Firstly, I realized that I haven't been able to take many ancient classes. Eric's 500 level Greek Metaphysics class, his Parmenides seminar and your Aristotle independent study are the only three. The rest have been in ethics (Anita, Tim) or philosophy of mind (Clare) or Kant (Stefan). I did email Eric and he graciously agreed to be on my committee. But with him on sabbatical this semester and your naturalism class, I am realizing that my time for more Ancient seminars is quickly running short. (Of course, independent studies or focused reading classes could do much on this front.)

Secondly, I reflected on the papers I've been writing and simply found that naturalism is on my mind. At Talbot, I took a metaphysics class and a philosophy of mind class that were both aimed at setting up and critiquing naturalistic alternatives to classical theism. Here, my first seminar Kant paper for Stefan was all about how McDowell's 'second nature' might compatible with non-naturalistic theism. My paper for Aristotle and Aristotelians on Mind was all about a non-naturalistic (hylomorphic) account of the mind. My paper for Philosophy of Religion was about how miracles are likely in spite of naturalistic prejudices. My paper for Tim's metaethics class was all about how Gibbard's norm-expressivism fails to live up to its own naturalistic standards, and thus indicts ethical naturalism. My most recent paper for Clare is not directly about naturalism but is closely in dialogue with the naturalists while arguing for a virtue ethical or moral realist view of imagination. (And now this paper has been accepted for a conference.) 

It just strikes me that naturalism, philosophy of mind, and ethics are on my mind. 

So this provokes the question: should I continue that apparent mental "momentum" into my doctoral research or stay the course with my decade long intention and do ancient? 

(I do not think answering this question is quite the urgent matter that it feels to me at the moment. I probably have a year before I have to answer it. Nevertheless, I want to plod in the right direction.)


There are five self-reflections I am wrestling with and trying to weigh (and hence would covet your feedback). Please forgive the inevitable narcissism the following inquiry involves. 

1) Since I haven't written much or presented anything in ancient, I am feeling insecure about the potential quality of that writing. It's not that I've proven myself unable to -- but I haven't proven myself able to write excellently in that area, given the language and exegesis prerequisite to even getting to the arguments. 

So should I push through this insecurity and see if I can do it or go with what's already working? 

2) Pragmatically, I am highly motivated to start my dissertation as soon as possible finish it in a strict, timely manner so I can get on the market. If I had to start tomorrow (thank God I don't!) imagining sitting down to write 200 pages on Plato sounds very daunting, given the amount of scholarship I need to become familiar with and the level of language/exegesis required. (I am going to continue with Greek regardless -- it's a lot of fun and very useful). Imagining sitting down to write 200 pages on naturalism in ethics and metaphysics, on the other hand, sounds very motivating. The scholarship I am much more familiar with, a lot of it is Anglo-American, and one could in one sense "get straight to" the arguments. 

Is that kind of pragmatic consideration a worthwhile one or is it always that case that dissertation writing becomes overwhelming at some point or another so the "daunting" factor shouldn't be a factor?

3) Interest wise, I would love teaching ancient or ethics/philosophy of mind at my first job. During the 720 proseminar, you put the AOS in terms of "What would you be comfortable/interest in teaching graduate seminars on for the next 10 years, as well as writing/publishing etc.?" Well, on that front naturalism is a hot topic for me, and has additional draw of that urgent feel of spiritual warfare. We need more folks out there who understand and can offer sustained critiques of the dominant orthodoxy. Plato and Aristotle, on the other hand, will always fascinate me and I hope one day to teach at a liberal arts or great books school such that I can teach them no matter what my specialty is. So on this front either it is a draw, or the naturalism side pulls me a tiny bit more. 

Should I spend more time reflecting on this consideration or is either research area going to inevitably be interesting and become boring/aggravating (especially during the writing phase) before it becomes interesting again? 

4) Jobs wise, it seems that the market has more ethics and metaphysics or phil. mind openings than it does ancient openings. That could change in 3 years, of course. 

But right now, in the interest of making myself desirable on the market, is one or the other research area advisable? Should I even be worrying about that? 

5) Finally, regarding my committee... I applied to UK out of a desire to work with the author of Aristotle: East and West. I was and am inexpressibly grateful that the program accepted me and that you have extended such a hand of friendship and guidance. Hence the thought of having a different advisor than Dr. Bradshaw seems to me quite a crazy one. If I did choose a research topic outside of ancient I feel as if I'd be missing out on studying with you, which weighs heavily against it. 


There may of course be a simple solution to this dilemma. Perhaps there is a topic within naturalism somewhere on which you would feel comfortable being my advisor. 

Or perhaps I could do ancient but focus on Platonic (and Aristotelian) ethics, for instance, or Platonic philosophy of mind. That would open up a possible chapter devoted to discussing contemporary applications (perhaps titled "Rampant Platonism: A Defense" in honor of John McDowell?), but would keep the bulk of the research/writing in Plato. 

But I'm not sure. 

That's my dilemma as of now, in writing. I'd love to sit down over coffee if that's the best way. Feel free to respond in writing if you prefer. I know it's a busy time. 

Thank you, and happy first full week of the semester

According to Descartes the science of geometry, with its demonstrative reasoning from the simplest and clearest thoughts, constitutes the paradigm for the goal of unifying all knowledge. In adapting the scholastic image of knowledge, Descartes's tree holds that metaphysics are the roots, physics the trunk, and that the branches are mechanics, medicine and morals. Leibniz proposed a general science in the form of a demonstrative encyclopedia. This would be based on a “catalogue of simple thoughts” and an algebraic language of symbols, characteristica universalis, which would render all knowledge demonstrative and allow disputes to be resolved by precise calculation. Both defended the program of founding much of physics on metaphysics and ideas from life science (Smith 2011) (Leibniz's unifying ambitions with symbolic language and physics extended beyond science, to settle religious and political fractures in Europe).

Kant saw one of the functions of philosophy as determining the precise unifying scope and value of each science. For Kant, the unity of science is not the reflection of a unity found in nature; rather, it has its foundations in the unifying character or function of concepts and of reason itself.

More generally, for Kant unity was a regulative principle of reason, namely, an ideal guiding the process of inquiry toward a complete empirical science with its empirical concepts and principles grounded in the so-called concepts and principles of the understanding that constitute and objectify empirical phenomena (on the systematicity in this ideal and its origin in reason see Kitcher 1986).

In Great Britain this idealist unifying spirit (and other notions from an idealist and romantic turn) took form in William Whewell's philosophy of science. Two unifying dimensions are these: his notion of mind-constructed fundamental ideas, the basis for organizing axioms and phenomena and classifying sciences—e.g., space (geometry), limit (analysis), symmetry (crystallography), cause (mechanics), life or similarity (biology), etc.—and the argument for the reality of explanatory causes in the form of consilience of induction, wherein a single cause is independently arrived at as the hypothesis explaining different kinds of phenomena.

Their preoccupation with the historical dimension of the human phenomena, along with the Kantian emphasis on the conceptual basis of knowledge led to the suggestion that the natural sciences aimed at generalizations about abstract types and properties, but the human sciences studied concrete individuals and complexes. The human case suggested a different approach based on valuation and personal understanding (Weber's verstehen). In biology, Ernst Haeckel defended a monistic worldview (Richards 2008).

Empiricists assumed methodological individualism, but not without qualifications. Comte followed his Enlightenment predecessors in combining an analytical sense of conceptual order and a historical sense of progress. He emphasized a pyramidal hierarchy of disciplines in his “encyclopedic law” or order, from the most general sciences about the simplest phenomena to the most specific sciences about the most complex phenomena, each depending on knowledge from its more general antecedent: from inorganic physical sciences (arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, astronomy, physics and chemistry) to the organic physical ones, such as biology and the new “social physics”, soon to be renamed sociology (Comte 1830–1842).

The Weltbild tradition influenced the physicists Max Planck and Ernst Mach, who engaged in a heated debate about the precise character of the unified scientific world-picture, and culminated in the first two decades of the twentieth century with the work of Albert Einstein (Holton 1998). Mach's more influential view was both phenomenological and Darwinian: the unification of knowledge took the form of an analysis of ideas into elementary sensations (neutral monism) and was ultimately a matter of adaptive economy of thought. Planck adopted a realist view that took science to gradually approach complete truth about the world, and fundamentally adopted the thermodynamical principles of energy and entropy (on the Mach-Planck debate see Toulmin 1970). These world-pictures constituted some of the alternatives to a long-standing mechanistic view that, since the rise of mechanistic philosophy with Descartes and Newton, had informed biology as well

In the 1890s, Gottlob Frege and Hilbert had aimed at setting the mathematical sciences on rigorous foundations. The ideal had the form of an axiomatic system. Frege aimed at founding arithmetic on axioms of logic and Hilbert proposed that geometry be founded upon purely formal axioms. In 1920, Hilbert proposed his general formalist research project for the axiomatic formalization of mathematics, which he also extended to physics. He hoped that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity could be synthesized with the theory of electromagnetism to form a foundation for all of physics. Mathieu Leclerc du Sablon published his L'Unité de la Science (1919), exploring metaphysical foundations, and Johan Hjorst published The Unity of Science (1921), sketching out a history of philosophical systems and unifying scientific hypotheses.

Otto Neurath, by contrast, favored a less idealized and less reductive model of unity predicated on the complexity of empirical reality. He spoke of an “encyclopedia-model”, instead of the classic ideal of the pyramidal, reductive “system-model”. The encyclopedia-model took into account the presence within science of uneliminable and imprecise terms from ordinary language and the social sciences and emphasized a unity of language and the local exchanges of scientific tools. Specifically, Neurath stressed the material-thing-language called “physicalism”, not to be confounded with the emphasis on the vocabulary of physics. His view was not constrained by Carnap's ideals of conceptual precision, deductive systematicity and logical rigor. No unified science, like a boat at sea, would rest on firm foundations. This weaker model of unity emphasized empiricism and the normative unity of the natural and the human sciences.

In general, it is useful to distinguish between ontological unity and epistemological unity, even if many accounts bear both characteristics and fall under both rubrics. In some cases, one kind supports the other salient kind in the model. Ontological unity is here broadly understood as involving relations between conceptual elements; in some cases the concepts will describe entities, properties or relations and the models will focus on metaphysical aspects of the unifying connections such as holism, emergence, or downwards causation. Epistemological unity applies to relations or goals such as explanation. Methodological connections and formal (logical, mathematical, etc.) models belong in this kind. I will not draw any strict or explicit distinction between epistemological and methodological dimensions or modes of unity.

Two formulations by logical positivists in the United States about the ideal logical structure of science again placed the question of unity of science at the core of philosophy of science: Carl Hempel's deductive-nomological model of explanation and Ernst Nagel's model of reduction. Both were fundamentally epistemological models, and both were specifically explanatory. The emphasis on logical structure makes unity of explanation and reduction chiefly of the synchronic kind. Nagel's model of reduction is a model of scientific structure and explanation as well as of scientific progress. It is based on the problem of relating different theories as different sets of theoretical predicates.

At the end of the day one should not lose sight of the larger context that sustains problems and projects in most disciplines and practices. We are as free to pursue them as Kant's dove is to fly, that is, not without the surrounding air resistance to flap its wings upon and against. Philosophy was once thought to stand for the systematic unity of the sciences. The foundational character of unity became the distinctive project of philosophy, in which conceptual unity played the role of the standard of intelligibility. In addition, the ideal of unity, frequently under the guise of harmony, has long been a standard of aesthetic virtue (This image has been eloquently challenged by, for instance, John Bailey and Iris Murdoch; Bailey 1976; Murdoch 1992). </Text>

His evidence is that, of course, he has examined everything in the whole lab and there are no eyeballs there — none detached and awaiting inspection.  We do not want to be like that scientist!

            <Title>5 kinds of metaethical objections/questions</Title>
            <Text>Darwell’s essay argues that metaethics (or analytic ethics or critical ethics) is best practiced within a dynamic union with normative ethics. (The combination of the two, Darwall suggests, might be called philosophical ethics.) Not only was this how Moore approached ethics in 1903, but it is how many contemporary writers are approaching ethics, despite the trend in the middle of the century to write either about metaethical issues or ignore them for the sake of normative ethical ones. 

I take my task to be to advance anglophone virtue ethics but to do so by virtue of addressing head on some of the most pressing, most challenging, and (to me at least) most interesting objections and questions. Objections come from opponents and questions from often confused bystanders.  
In one sense, the normative ethical content of virtue ethics is simple: go become virtuous. There is much more to it than that. But virtue education tries to instill virtues in children; virtue politics tries to create polities in which it is “easy to be good” and politicians who are scrupulous, upstanding, wise, honest, and trustworthy; virtue epistemology tries to show what character traits are necessary or beneficial or sufficient for being the kind of person who can know things. And so on. 
But then the questions begin: which traits are virtues? What do you mean by “virtuous”? Is there really happiness? 

Many of the objections and questions for virtue ethical writers like MacIntyre, Foot, Hursthouse, and McDowell are objections and questions with correlates outside of virtue ethics. 



1. Words. Moore’s analytic ethics was part of the linguistic turn in philosophy. He thought the failure of much ethical writing before him was a lamentable inattention to the terms deployed in that writing. What is a virtue? What does it mean to say that the natural end of human life is happiness? 
2. Properties. Moore argued that goodness was a simple, undefinable concept and a simple, non-natural and irreducible property. Just what are we talking about in the nexus of related locutions like the following? Virtues are good for people; happiness is the good; for people like us, goodness is virtue. What is a virtue (not the word now, but the thing)? 
3. Knowledge. Moore argued that the belief “X is good” is based on noticing the property of goodness — intuited directly — and neither requires nor admits of support from any other belief. How do I know which traits are virtues? 
	3b. Disagreement. If I can intuit that X is good but you cannot, is there any way to adjudicate our disagreement? In the context of virtue ethics, how do I know which list of virtues to ally myself to? 
4. Human Nature. Moore argues that the greatest intrinsic goods are, for us, the pleasures of friendship and the pleasures of beauty (in art and nature). These are the goods worth pursuing, and the production of these goods justifies right actions. But what are we? And what is our relationship to nature? What are human beings such that we enjoy friendship and create and consume beauty? In this vein, is there really a human nature such that happiness or eudaemonia even makes sense conceptually? 
5. Nature (all of reality). Moore opens up the discussion for a cosmic rather than merely human perspective when he includes the beauty of nature. This cosmological perspective is welcome.Panayot Butchvarov, “Ethics Dehumanized” in Metaethics After Moore. % Human beings need not and ought not occupy “center stage” of our ethical thinking. 
	5b. Under this heading, is nature teleological? Is there such thing as natural normativity?  

So each of the thinkers I will examine are virtue ethicists but also address, more or less explicitly, these five metaethical topics and these (or closely related) objections and/or questions. </Text>

            <Title>#### No need for telos</Title>
            <Text>#### No Need for Telos Objection

It seems that morality (not to mention politics and society) can get along well without teleology. To make good on what is possible, one must simply furnish an example of what is actual. To definitely prove that egg-laying mammals *are possible*, one simply needs to furnish a platypus. To make good on the usefulness and adequacy of a non-teleological ethics, one simply needs to furnish such an ethics. Two broad schools of thought take themselves to supply such an ethics: the Kantian deontologists and the consequentialists. 

Objection 1. It seems that the moral law *by itself* tells us what actions are wrong or not wrong. @korsgaard1996authority argues that the autonomous moral law delivers judgments -- and generates categorical obligations -- without regard to teleology. These duties or laws are generated by our *practical identity*. That is, there are some actions that violate my practical identities. Trivially, if I call myself a baker I must bake things. If I refuse to bake I disintegrate that practical identity. Though she does not say it like this, I would state that identities are *functional concepts.* To be a farmer is in some sense to *do what farmers do*. To be a sea captain, or a teacher, or a father, is to *perform the functions* prescribed by or definitionally built into those concepts. Even if the exact limits and boundaries of a functional concept are sometimes fuzzy or flexible, they are still intelligible. Now, my first and fundamental practical identity is that of human being.[@korsgaard1996authority] I simply must value my own humanity if I am to value anything at all. And I do value things; therefore, I do value my own humanity. Anyone who values anything values their own humanity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 

Objection 2. It seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of telos. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). 

On the other hand, however, these modern moralities are either covertly teleological or they are incoherent. Charles Taylor argues this point persuasively.[@taylor] We do not need to take the point on authority. We can rediscover it ourselves rather quickly. 

As a sample for review, examine Kantian deontology and its base-line foundation: Kant famously pronounced: "Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of it, which can be called good, without qualification, except a good will."[@kantgroundwork] This is the first principle of Kantianism: the categorical imperative, the value of humanity, the value of autonomy, the identification of a will that obeys the categorical imperative with 'the good will'.  The good will is good because it follows the good law; the law of autonomy (all other laws being heteronomous); the categorical imperative is the unconditional obligation on all practically rational beings whatsoever to treat other rational beings as ends in themselves, others being equally autonomous, others being equally human and therefore equally valuable. This is all very consistent. 

But why are humans valuable? Kant can give no answer to this. It is his own emotive assertion. 

Take any other modern moral philosophy such as Humean sentimentalism, utilitarian consequentialism, psychological egoism or contractarianism. Consider its base-line foundation, its summum bonum, its first principle, its Great Platitude, and you will discover the same baseless base, the same groundless assumption. 

For Humean sentimentalism the first principle is the relation between the good and my affections. "To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to feel a satisfaction of particular kind from the contemplation of a character." (*Treatise of Human Nature* 471)

For contractarianism it is the value of keeping promises. "The moral theory of contractarianism claims that moral norms derive their normative force from the idea of contract or mutual agreement." But such a value is a western prejudice.

&gt;Contracts require independent agents who are able to make and carry out promises without the aid of others. Historically, while white men have been treated as these pure wills of contract theory, Blacks and women have been treated as anti-will: dependent and irrational. Both ideals are false; whole people, she says, are dependent on other whole people. But by defining some as contractors and others as incapable of contract, whole classes of people can be excluded from the realm of justice. This point has been explored by other critics of contractarianism, first by Allen Buchanan (1993) and more recently by Eva Kittay (1999), who points out that not only are dependents such as children and disabled people left out of consideration by contractarian theories, but their caretakers' needs and interests will tend to be underestimated in the contract, as well.[@sepcontractarianism]

For consequentialism it is the value of happiness or pleasure. All that Mill can say to the inquirer who wants to hear about *why* happiness is desirable is that people desire it.

&gt;It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?
&gt;Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfill -- to make good its claim to be believed?
&gt;The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.[@mill chapter 4, "Of what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible"]

This kind of hand-waving does not inspire the confidence of eudaimonist virtue theorists who think that the "proof" of the principle of eudaimonia is "susceptible" of something much more robust. 

Reply to Objection 1. Korsgaard's point here is not far off from MacIntyre's (nor I assume far from Sandel's or any other communitarian's). Her thesis is that a moral identity qua practical identity is fundamental and supports other practical identities (like son, brother, citizen, teacher). Insofar as human nature is a real thing, MacIntyre can agree that humanity is a functional concept. If I am to be human, there are some deeds I must do. MacIntyre (and, I presume, other communitarians) would simply query whether I can discover my identity qua human before discovering it qua American or member of the Buhler family or "westerner". What is deepest metaphysically is last epistemologically. MacIntyre might argue that Korsgaard cannot discover her identity qua human without her western education, without reading Kant, without the benefit of being a part of the Enlightenment tradition. Korsgaard takes for granted her identity as a westerner and falsely construes that particular identity -- invisible to her -- as *the* universal human identity. Would Christine Korsgaard, the particular human being, have the same belief about human identity if she were raised not in the U. S. but in the E. U. or the U. A. E. in a different moral tradition? 

Reply to Objection 2. Consequences may be "external" or "internal." That is, consequences of an action may be non-natural or natural. The oxygenation of the blood is a natural consequence of breathing. Our biological make-up determines that the act of breathing and the oxygenation of the blood an organic whole. A natural consequence of holding your breath is a build up of carbon dioxide. Winning a world record for holding your breath underwater is a non-natural consequence of holding your breath. Consequentialists either do not distinguish between the two or are explicit that there are no ends or consequences related internally or naturally with some means. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;But before proceeding to this discussion I propose, first, to deal with the third kind of ethical question—the question: What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalization. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. Good effects Moore argues are aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships. Strangely enough, the same Moore defines the necessary relation between parts and a whole as an "organic whole" or "organic unity." But he sees no organic unity between (some) means and their ends. Some means are partially constitutive of their ends. We might say that the *means* and the *end* form in that instance an organic whole. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constitutive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species gorilla gorilla as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics. 

The problem here is inconsistency and self-deception. The modern tradition, the “traditionless-tradition” either helps itself to Aristotelian telos while vehemently denying it, or (if honest) collapses into the “truthless-tradition” of postmodernity. 

#### Ends/means Objection. ####

I said above that the refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. Charles Taylor endorses the notion that “the place accorded the virtues [is] a kind of litmus test for discriminating Aristotelian from modern ethical theory.”[@taylor 25]

What could this mean? 

Behind the means/end distinction is a peculiarly modern assumption that formal and final causes are either not related or not *necessarily* related. There are various ways of cashing out this distinction. In biology, it is the distinction between form and function.[@huneman2006naturalising] In engineering it is the distinction between design and operation.

            <Text># MacIntyre: The Telos of Practice (The *After Virtue* Project)

## Introduction

Modernity is a disaster. 

If this statement sounds false to you — needlessly polemical, reactionary, exaggerated — then MacIntyre’s life work will seem much ado about not much. If it sounds true to you, or near the truth, then MacIntyre’s life work will be of great interest. 

There are very few positions in between. 

In this chapter, we shall explore and analyze the ethical thought of Alasdair MacIntyre, especially his notion of practice and tradition. Practices (such as farming, teaching, and moral inquiry itself) are inherently teleological or end-directed activities that take place in the context of traditions. But this claim needs to be unpacked. 

MacIntyre’s ethical oeuvre spans many decades and has evolved through many ideologies. He has been a Marxist, Aristotelian, and (now) a Thomist. What has persisted is his criticism of post-Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] For this reason, his work is an excellent starting point for these dissertation chapters. If a coherent and intelligible and socially useful and personally enriching concept of virtue can be constructed within the confines of modern moral philosophy, then MacIntyre’s dire diagnosis is mistaken. If, however, his diagnosis is correct, then much of modern moral virtue ethics has the same contagion. 

I shall  mostly treat his later work (from *After Virtue* to *Dependent Rational Animals*). These are most relevant to the kind of philosophical ethics I aim to study. At the same time, building his account of virtue requires foundations in moral psychology, epistemology, and philosophy of action. So I shall seek to elucidate the concept (or concepts) of virtue operative in MacIntyre’s theory, especially as virtue is a concept related to practice. 

The first section will summarize and interact with a limited set of important theses and show how he situates those claims in a historical context. For MacIntyre, the backdrop of successful moral inquiry must be the realization that modern moral philosophies have largely failed — failed by their own standards of success. Later sections will critically respond to these writings, citing objections from various critics as well as pressing novel objections. Finally, I shall attempt to adjudicate the case and draw from it lessons we can endorse for a sound account of virtue. 

### MacIntyre’s View
A few words in pre-payment about MacIntyre’s conclusions is in order. Although he is perhaps best known as a critic — and widely dismissed as a radical or polemical critic — he has also constructed a powerful positive account of virtues. He views his positive ethical positions as inheriting a tradition from the past, but vehemently denies that they are *nostalgic.* We might even point out that his positive accounts are modern. They are "traditional" in the sense that tradition needs to be *both* received from the past *and* modified, improved, corrected, clarified, and augmented in the present before being passed on to the future. To be traditional, we can rightly say, is to be staunchly future-oriented -- since the work of life is to pass on to the next generation everything that is precious and valuable. 

Most broadly, MacIntyre thinks that virtues are good and useful for transforming communities and persons. At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) would do well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. Even though such a common vision of and pursuit of virtue is impossible to scale up indefinitely for 300+ millions people (in the U.S., for instance), it is possible and beneficial at smaller, local scales. And indeed, this is already happening. 

At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

### What I Endorse
The first thesis I will extract from MacIntyre and defend is that success in moral inquiry is possible because moral inquiry answers (or can answer) to the moral facts. But moral inquiry, as he will argue, must be conceived (like psychology) as a process rather than (like mathematics) a static and ready-made argument about universal relations between propositional truths. The object studied by ethics is not merely ethical principles but ethical persons; but the subject studying ethics is also the ethical person. So, unlike mathematics or physics, the subject is also the object. One feature of persons is that we are living a finite life, beginning in complete ignorance (as children) and progressing toward death. So moral inquiry, when successful, is that part of our life when we become sensitive to reasons, and begin (usually under guidance) to reflect on our own nature as practical reasoners. We first reflect on our projects, commitments, and priorities, and secondly begin to adjust our projects to pursue worthy ends by better means or to pursue ends we find more worthy. MacIntyre vociferously criticizes G. E. Moore’s Principia Ethica as beholden to false presuppositions and a naive, ahistorical attempt to do moral inquiry in a vacuum. 

The second thesis from MacIntyre I shall defend is that moral inquiry depends indispensably on natural teleology, specifically social teleology.  Social teleology is different from a global natural teleology. The differences are worth pointing out here. Some ends are real and natural; some end-directed motions, processes, and actions are real and natural. The notion of natural teleology has been disregarded, maligned, and misunderstood for many generations. So clarifying and defending my version of it will be an important piece of this chapter. As a brief pre-payment, I shall distinguish between various kinds of end-directed activity, from least controversial to most: (A) the end-directed (definitely intentional) actions and speech-acts of individual human subjects (e.g., going to the gym to get fit or uttering a sentence to communicate a proposition) and (B) the end-directed (definitely intentional) actions of groups, associations, societies; (C) the end-directed (intentional?) actions of all human beings in virtue of their humanity; (D) the end-directed (possibly intentional) processes of non-human animals (e.g., a deer fleeing a predatory to survive or a turtle swimming ashore to lay eggs); (E) the end-directed (though non-intentional) functions or processes of organic systems (the heart pumping blood to oxygenate the body, the optical photoreceptors converting light signals to electricity to produce sight); (F) the end-directed (though non-intentional) processes of individual non-organic substances (the piece of ice melting at 33 degrees Fahrenheit, the sunlight streaming through the atmosphere to make the plants grow); and (G) the end-directed (though non-intentional) global or cosmic process by which the universe seems to be moving (forming planets that can bring about life; abiogenerating life so as to bring about complex organisms). Having distinguished these, not all of them shall I defend.

Rather, the centrality of at least some human social or natural teleology (A)-(C) to normative virtue ethics cannot be understated. And the centrality of natural teleology — some subset of (C)-(G) — to giving a plausible foundation of virtue will be seen in not only MacIntyre, but Foot, Hursthouse, and Brown. Briefly, in *After Virtue* MacIntyre presented a “socially teleological” account of human virtue and practice rather than a “biologically teleological” account — one that “does not require the identification of any teleology in nature."[@macintyre1984after 183] I shall try to defend both. But for now, we must turn to a survey of MacIntyre’s ethical theory. 

## The After Virtue Project

### The Problem: Moral and Metaethical Disagreement

MacIntyre’s ethical oeuvre is best seen as a response to the problem of moral disagreement. His earlier writings focused on ethics. These writings took for granted some of the major modern assumptions about what moral inquiry is and what it can and should do. But he noticed that the state of the art was disarray. Professional ethicists disagreed with each other on any normative point you can think of (the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation), on normative frameworks (deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism), and on metaethical points (moral realism, moral epistemology, moral semantics), and more. He was frustrated (as we have all been) but the apparent impossibility of settling some moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreeing on the formal and material propositions under dispute. The apparent impossibility of settling moral disagreements over weighty primary normative issues, like abortion, sexual ethics, torture, war, the proper uses of technology has become the defining datum of modern reflection on morality and ethics. 

There is a striking similarity between moral/philosophical disagreements and kinds of disagreements in natural sciences. Those familiar with the philosophy of science conversation about methodology and disagreement may notice this. MacIntyre certainly did. Thomas Kuhn’s watershed Structure of Scientific Revolutions challenges the widespread naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquires has been growing, steadily, in a straight line, since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. The paradigm is a research program around which many can unite as well as a stable scientific system of doctrine that can be added to or pruned. But lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm, once revolutionary, becomes the stable scientific system of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyarabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call it MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] But unlike Kuhn, MacIntyre is not a postmodernist; while Feyerabend ended in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology, a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists, MacIntyre’s theory attempts to avoid relativism. Some would say he was unsuccessful. But this is getting ahead of myself.  

The fact is that people disagree about morals. Many metaethicists react such widespread, rampant, shrill, and apparently intractable moral disagreement by giving up on moral realism. The old project was a searching for the objective moral facts, the self-evident moral truths, or fundamental moral principles by which moral disagreements can be peaceably and reasonably settled without browbeating, censorship, name-calling, and ejection from the conversation. The new project is to accept the painful truth that there are no such facts, no such truths, no such principles: agreement is either impossible or is going to come about by different means: social contract, say, or disparate communities accepting disparate sets of “common values”, each set incommensurable with the others but also invincible to criticism.

Other metaethicists react to widespread moral disagreement by redoubling their efforts to restore moral agreement by reference to moral facts, truths, or principles. Kantian (Korsgaard), utilitarian, contractarian, and now virtue ethical theorists compete in the marketplace of metaethics for the proper way to secure morality. 

It may not be obvious to those of us reading deeply in the discipline, but a moment’s reflection on modern metaethics reveals an iteration of the problem of moral disagreement. The disagreement among metaethicists (since Moore) about the proper explanation of and solution to disagreement among ethicists (since Hobbes, Hume, and Kant) has become the new problem of disagreement. 


### The Solution: The *After Virtue* Project 

MacIntyre engaged in this metaethical dispute for some years. After a while, he gave up. Instead, he initiated a new project, which some call the “*After Virtue* Project”.[@murphy2003alasdair]  That project aims to justify joining and advancing the Aristotelian tradition of moral inquiry as a replacement of modern moral philosophical projects. The project explains the failure of metaethics to solve the failure of primary ethics. not only moral disagreement but the failure of metaethical explanations of moral disagreement. The key works in this project are *After Virtue* (1984), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988), and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry* (1990), and *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999). Each lays out more pieces of an unfolding ethical theory, (arguably) culminating in *Dependent Rational Animals*. But the MacIntyrean spirit of inquiry demands that we not treat his last statement of his theory as the final (ultimate) statement of the theory — it is simply “the best so far.” 

*After Virtue* most clearly states the problem of moral disagreement in modern moral philosophy, putting it in historical context. It argues that the problem at the root of the problem of moral disagreement is a series of fragmentations, facts from values, the self from the community, my good from the common good, and our concepts of justice and rationality from tradition. Each of these elements contribute to making modern, secular, rationalistic moral enquiry a hopeless endeavor. The upshot is that we have a dilemma: If modern rationalistic morality is hopeless (moral inquiry as encyclopedia), then we must either embrace Nietzsche’s self-justifying amoral Will-to-Power (moral inquiry as genealogy), or embrace the Aristotelian tradition of virtue (morality as tradition). 

If the deconstructive argument is correct, then modern moralities like deontology and utilitarianism (including all their trappings and purport of objectivity) are just as expressivistic as emotivism. A recurring theme in *After Virtue* and beyond is that there are two possible prognoses of this illness. The first is to abandon the purport of objectivity: follow expressivism and, ultimately, side with Nietzsche. We unmask all rational justifications of morality. We opt for cunning rather than wisdom; amplify our means to deteriorated ends. But we should not embrace Nietzsche. 

The second prognosis is to abandon the totalized fiction of community-free autonomous individual self that animates modern liberalism. “We lack,” he says, “any coherent rationally defensible statement of the liberal individualist point of view”.[@macintyre1984after 241] If we see ourselves, again, as members of a community within a shared tradition, with shared origins, goals, and standards, then the objectivity and rational basis of morality becomes intelligible again. That is the Aristotelian tradition. We should get back to tradition to go forward. 


### Modern Moral Philosophy is a disaster

Let’s look at the problem in a bit more detail. 

The first and most obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in a despair of ever reaching agreement.The dual aspect of modern moral philosophy is that disputants on either side purport to be presenting the objective moral truth and they possess no unavailable rational standard for supporting their own view, let alone convincing others on purely rational or evidential grounds.  Individually, these aspects are not puzzling: One pattern is that when I meet people who do not share my tastes or preferences, I do not browbeat; I simply I live and let live. Another pattern is that when I meet people whom I view as ignorant or mistaken,  I try to persuade them by appealing to evidence to ascribe to the same rational, putatively objective standards I endorse But moral discourse doesn’t fit either of these non-puzzling patterns. how can my own, arbitrary, unaccountable opinions and preferences form the basis for browbeating those who do not share the same opinions and preferences as if they were not just different from me but ignorant and mistaken? Moral discourse with its expression of moral disagreement still retain the appearance of rationality at the same time that the seem to have given up on the rationality and publicly-accessible nature of morality. 


### Practice, Virtue, Telos, and Human Nature

#### Preforatory Remarks
Now let’s look at the putative solution in a bit more detail. MacIntyre does not simply recommend a “return to virtue.” Any talk of “returning” sounds like it is a nostalgic and anti-progressive longing for the past. The solution is not to reverse progress but to propose an alternative standard of progress. 

MacIntyre revisits the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”: the *Nicomachean Ethics.* There we find the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Hence our practical rationality is natural even though it is not material. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The telos of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 


### Virtue 
So what is a virtue, for MacIntyre? His first definition of virtue is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices”[@macintyre1984after 191]. 
This definition demands elaboration on “practices” and “internal goods”. Consider the practice of farming. A practice may be understood not as a mere action (like scratching an itch) but an intelligible set of actions organized around a goal and embedded in a social context. Farming is not just one action, but an intelligible set of actions (tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc.). Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 
Eventually, MacIntyre’s account of virtue transcends even this notion of practice, or at least transcends the narrowest definition of practice. His account of virtue includes three layers or dimensions: individual skill (like farming), social activity (like statesmanship), and human activity (like practical reasoning about how to live well). But it is essential to groups the first layer. 
So how do virtues enable the achievement of goods internal to practices? A virtue like courage enables a farmer who possesses it to achieve the goods internal to farming, namely, edible food. “Internal goods” are those goods necessarily related to the practice, that are natural to the practice. A farmer might be famous in his town for hosting a yearly fair. He may receive praise, admiration, or extra financial income from this fair, but such goods are no part of *farming* per se. A farmer might be physically fit, strong, and able-bodied due to his manual labor. But he does not set about farming *in order to* become fit. 
The absence of virtue, by contrast, “effectively presents” achieving the goods internal to practice. A cowardly farmer might overreact to a year of bad weather, change his methods in radical ways, upset delicate balances, and ultimately grow less edible food in the coming years. 
But this definition of virtue (in terms of practices) demands an explication of the concept of practice. I used farming as an example but thus far left the definition of practice implicit. 

#### Practices
A practice, for MacIntyre, is a term of art denoting an activity carried out in a community (of fellow practictioners) according to a common history, common standards, and common goals.  Examples include chess, medicine, farming, politics. Lutz summarizes MacIntyre’s famous passage in this way:  a virtue is “(1) a complex social activity that (2) enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. (3) Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, (4) the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.”[@lutz2015]

#### An example of a practice
To get this definition in a bit clearer view, take MacIntyre’s favored example of a practice: political activity. Political activity can be done for reasons internal or external to the practice. That is, political activity can be done in order to bring about those objects necessarily political: the health, securing, and flourishing of the polis. Or it can be done in order to achieve “external” (unessential) goods like fame, power, prestige, or book deals. Effectiveness in attaining these external goods does not constitute virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice are temptations. Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

Now, practices are distinct from (but related to) institutions or traditions. For example, a university is an institution defined by a set of practices in which professors and students engage. Thomas is a tradition defined by a set of arguments playing out over time embedded in a social community. 

This distinction helps us to build up the second dimension of virtue.  Virtues indexed to practices are only one part of MacIntyre’s account; the second layer or dimension is social. This dimension stands to reason: agents are individuals but not merely individuals. 

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]


#### Detachable self? 
The notion of a detachable self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self. Rather, each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture. Furthermore, it is very often in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. Injustice, cowardice, “corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] The persuasive examples are those of a present day black American whose identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites, or a present day Irishman whose identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century English to 18th century Irish. The if the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

#### Objection to virtue indexed to practice
But thus far, by the first and second dimensions of his account of virtue, the account virtually begs to be read as a type of relativism: Is torture a practice? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. But MacIntyre denies being a relativist[@macintyre1984after xii-xiii in the 25th anniversary edition]. The full answer to the charge of relativism I detail and respond to below. For now, we only need to see how this objection forces MacIntyre to add the third layer or dimension to his account of virtue. He admits that there might be evil practices. We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil. If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. So the account must do justice to the assumption that virtues are good for their possessor. 

#### Human Virtue 
The third level, then, is the broadest — that of humanity. Individuals and societies or social groups do not share much (anything?) but what we are as biological and psychological creatures. MacIntyre admits that defining virtues in terms of practices necessitates questioning whether life as a whole can be virtuous — the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] Integrity is not our telos, but it is a necessary condition. So, from this broadest view, even practices and institutions can be judged by how well they accord with our overall purpose, our overall life, and our overall nature.

### Human virtue as practical reasoning since human nature is practical reason
As for human nature, human beings are practical reasoners; we are dependent, rational animals. That is what we are. And yes, we have natures. That word and that concept are not out-dated, outmoded, irrelevant, obsolete, unscientific, or any other such slur. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] And we are practical reasoners (more on that below). We are in a position to see how MacIntyre’s account of virtue works. We find ourselves in a tradition (or more than one). Within that, we find ourselves engaging in practices. We engage in some of these practices inside, and others outside, institutions. Virtues are those skills that enable us to perform the practice excellently; virtues are also those skills and habits by which we perform various social roles excellently; but finally virtues are those qualities by which we aim our practices toward an excellent human life, and by which we integrate our various social roles toward human ends. For instance, the most general virtuous qualities contribute to the flourishing of human being qua practical reasoner. The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. The “human nature” that is universally distributed across each member of our species is the capacity (sometimes unrealized) to become practical reasoners. This  makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. 

### Virtue and related concepts — *Eudaimonia*

So much for a summary of MacIntyre’s account of virtue. Some further comments are needed to fill out the relationship of virtue to eudaemonia. Talk of human nature and telos are inseparable. For MacIntyre, the loss of telos (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But telos unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear telos is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

MacIntyre’s provisional conception of our human telos is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human telos is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our telos consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single telos governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative. 

### The Relation Between Virtue and Telos
With this in mind, the relation between virtue and telos comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our telos. MacIntyre says: “The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good."[@macintyre1984after 219] The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of telos as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist. A cheeky paraphrase would be to: our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human telos (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the telos might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our telos consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate telos of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eadaimonia. 
	
### *Dependent Rational Animals*

This discussion has, so far, kept itself mostly to *After Virtue*, only alluding to other works in the “*After Virtue* Project.” I would like now to continue the story by including some themes and details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to a critical response. 

The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally important as our independence, our autonomy and self-sufficiency. There are virtues of both dependence and autonomy. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate or overshadow the commonalities between us and other animals. “I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Regarding (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says he “virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities they're specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how do while they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.” (Op. Cit.). 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9]

So we may fairly draw this connection between *Dependent Rational Animals* and *After Virtue*: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and virtues must be sensitive to all three of these points. On the one extreme, we cannot treat ourselves as slavish worms (without any practical reason whatsoever) nor on the other extreme can we treat ourselves as autonomous gods (without any dependency whatsoever). A human being is a practical reasoner in a human community. I would venture so far as to suggest this axiom as a definition of our species. (It is more accurate than flat-nailed featherless bipeds.) We are social animals by nature, and we are practical animals by nature, and we are reasoners by nature. 

### We are practical reasoners
Observations we can readily make to support this axiom are so abundant it is hard to know where to start. A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. Each of these situations, I hope, so familiar that my analysis will not (yet!) be controversial. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

If this is true, the converse would be true: those who are not practical reasoners, or not in community, are not human. Regardless of whether this strikes a false note for the reader, it is at least intelligible. this corollary is the natural extension of the Greek view that exile was on par with, if not worse than, public execution. To remove you from your community is in an important sense to destroy you as a person. A hanging or poisoning only destroys you as a body. An exile is far worse than that. It rips you from your context, tears out from the social fabric the thread that you are. It turns you, while existing, into a non-being, a non-entity, an object. Regardless of whether we can sympathize with this way of thinking about exile, we can understand how one can be demoted from human status. 

We should not say that a non-practical-reasoner is not human, but that they fail to be exemplary. Brain-dead, or mentally handicapped, or injured etc., persons are not non-human but they are importantly defective qua humans, as I think common sense can recognize. 

### Why by moral? 
One answer to a perennial question of moral philosophy falls out of MacIntyre's picture of humanity as dependent animals/practical reasoners. That question is: "why be moral?" MacIntyre's point would be that we cannot pose such a skeptical challenge in the abstract. Who is the moral skeptic? Where does he come from? Where are his father and mother, his siblings, cousins, and his friends? If we answered these questions, we might learn something important about the abstract questions of moral motivation. 

The quotation marks are always ascribed to someone, however vaguely sketched the speaker is in the imagination. Perhaps we imagine a debonair 21st century immoralist who is getting away with whatever they can for the sake of thrills, or the angry and tumultuous bully like Thrasymachus (and Callicles), or brick-headed moral dunce, the psychopath whose conscience seemed broken at birth. It matters which we are imagining. 

Most of us have confronted by —  or have been — real, embodied moral skeptics. Those of us who professionally teach non-philosopher undergraduates have confronted a variety of moral skepticisms "in the wild," in actual human beings. But skepticism in the wild is rarely (and in my experience, never) identical to the petri dish skepticism from our thought laboratories. Actual moral skeptics in my experience are staunchly dogmatic about morality in general, even fanatically authoritarian, but are radically skeptical about one or two pet issues: say, sexuality and politics. One skeptic I am thinking of was so radically in favor of equality (a substantive moral principle if ever there was one) that he thought it morally acceptable to steal from corporations. 

Moral psychologists study a phenomenon that, I think, we can all observe: growing up in a family and with friends causes a majority of moral development. We learn our first deontological rules from our parents. We first have the fear of God put in us, those who fear God, by our God-fearing parents. But we also learn our first utilitarian principles from our siblings, friends, classmates, playmates, distant cousins, and — in a word, our peers. 

Davidson and Youniss, interpreting Piaget’s *The Moral Judgment of the Child,* argue that “the construction of identity and the construction of morality are aspects of the same construction.” [%1991, 112] In other words, MacIntyre’s close tie between the self (as a narrative unity), practical reason, and morality is justifiable on empirical psychological grounds as well. 

Apply this close tie to the amoralist or the moral skeptic. Do they have a home country, a family? John “Jack” Ames from Marilynn Robinson’s Pulitzer prize winning novel *Gilead* is an apparent amoralist.[@robinson2015gilead] Yet we know his family, the Boughton family, well. The unconditional love that Lila and the elder John Ames have for Jack eventually does seem to have an effect on him. But his behavior is both an expression of his self and forms his (new, different) self. 

The point of all this is that the question "why be moral?" has a clear answer for most people, but may have no answer in the abstract. The question “why be moral?” is, for those with a clear sense of self and a strong community, almost unthinkable. Not that there is no answer, but that the answer is so obvious the question becomes bizarre and bewildering. So, briefly, for MacIntyre, we can say that the answer to “why be moral?” in the proper social and ethical context is for us like the question “Why be yourself?” An answer may be possible, but it would be halting, awkward, and difficult. More likely than answering such a question, the virtuous agent with a clear sense of self rooted in a narrative about the community and the agent’s place within it would return the question, “Why would anyone ever consider not being themselves? Why would anyone ever consider not being moral?” 

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. For MacIntyre, moral inquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such inquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. 

## Objections

MacIntyre's philosophy is highly interesting, but forms such an interconnected whole that it is difficult to pick out and criticize just one part. For those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are “historically extended arguments."

MacIntyre's work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. Most broadly, on the one hand, defenders of what MacIntyre lumps together as "modernity" or "modern liberalism" object to the historical narrative by which they (all!) get somehow lumped together by a single (quite despairing) diagnosis of unintelligibility. On the other hand, even critics of modernity who accept his diagnosis might dispute the prognosis. For example, even Thomists with whom he ostensibly shares a philosophical school dispute his Thomism. 

By far the largest group of professional philosophers belong to one or the other of the two remaining rival versions of moral inquiry. And professional philosophers, of which he is a quite successful, may be tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy. (I treat 'success' here as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) "A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."[@hauerwas2007]

The three rival versions of moral inquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. But "Encyclopedists" dispute his historicism and the implied relativism of ethical theory. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, aperspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality. 

And (somewhat ironically) relativists like Gilbert Harman reject his moral realism. These think that his emphasis on traditions is well-taken, and that he should not therefore try to extricate any universal moral truths. 

"Geneologists" and postmodern philosophers agree with his critique of liberalism but choose, in a word, Nietzsche over Aristotle. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocuters, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful. 

First, an objection that amounts to an interpretive challenge: Call this the Primary Virtue Objection. It simply asks: Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of ’virtue’ is the primary sense of virtue? Aristotle’s conception of virtue is that virtues are acquired human qualities (habits) that contribute to (and are at least partially constitutive of) eudaemonia. Those qualities that contribute to the good internal to a practice are certainly skills, “know-how”, technical knowledge or what have you. But not all practices contribute to human flourishing.  Grand theft, torture, etc., are contrary to other virtues (respect for private property, kindness). Other practices can be plausibly seen as value-neutral (table tennis?). Therefore, not all MacIntyrean virtues qualify as Aristotelian virtues, in the sense that many assume virtues are beneficial to their posessor. 

A second objection we can just call the Relativism Objection. Virtues are relative to practices, to communities, and to human life as a whole. There is disagreement across cultures (even when there is agreement within a culture) about the end of human life, about the proper ends of communities and individuals. So all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that group consider to be virtues, not what virtues actually are. 

A third related objection is the Incoherence of Tradition Objection.  While not strictly about his ethical theory, since virtues are defined in part by traditions, it is important to consider the concept of tradition. This objections states that his tradition-constituted definition of rationality is self-contradictory. MacIntyre says on the one hand that, according to Tradition A, X is rational. According to Tradition B, X is not rational. They disagree and seem to genuinely disagree. A member of Tradition A can reasonably affirm that X cannot be both rational and irrational. Now, MacIntyre says that a member of Tradition B can discover some internal contradiction in Tradition B that makes her reconsider her tradition as aw hole. Perhaps she discovers that, according to Tradition B, Z is both rational and irrational. She is disconcerted by the contradiction. She decides to imaginatively entertain the possibility that Tradition A is more adequate and comes to see, over time, that Tradition A’s critique of Tradition B is compelling. The odd conclusion is this: affirming a contradiction is irrational for anyone in any Tradition. Now, I endorse this conclusion; if someone affirms a contradiction, and they persist in it in spite of repeated attempts to explain to them the contradiction, I would find them not just mistaken but fundamentally mentally impaired —  irrational. But the point is not whether the law of non-contradiction is true and a reliable criterion of rationality. The point is that MacIntyre cannot say so without contradicting himself. 

Suppose first that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational, while Tradition B teaches that logical contradictions can be rational. Then the member of Tradition B that affirms a contradiction (Z is both rational and irrational) will not, by her own standards, see a problem with her affirmation. A member of Tradition A will see the problem (by his own standards), but this is nothing surprising or new. The member of Tradition B has in principle no path out of her tradition, no motivation to see her tradition as mistaken, and hence no motivation to consider Tradition A. 

Suppose now that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational and Tradition B teaches the same. Now, according to MacIntyre, they agree (at least on this point) about a standard of rationality. They disagree about whether Z is rational or not, but they agree that Z cannot be both irrational and rational at the same time in the same respect. Are Tradition A and B now part of the same tradition, since they agree about the law of non-contradiction? Or are they different traditions, since they disagree about the rationality of Z? 

## Critical Response

While I agree with much of MacIntyre’s picture of the development of western civilization, there is far more in his proposals than I can comment on, let alone defend. 

Incoherence of Tradition. I’ll respond to the last objection first, since it seems to me the most tangential to MacIntyre’s ethical theory. I think it true that tradition influences our standards of rationality, justice, and virtue, but demonstrably false that it constitutes such standards. The law of non-contradiction is the counterexample. Every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction; every tradition denies rational agents the right to believe (P &amp; ~P). Any tradition that denies the law of non-contradiction, it seems to me, is an irrational tradition. And I don’t just intend to say it is irrational relative to my own standards of rationality, but that it is irrational full stop and possible to “step outside” my tradition far enough to see that. If there even does exist any person (such as Nagarjuna) or community or tradition that affirms (P &amp; ~P), we ought not interpret them as having a different standard of rationality but rather we ought to interpret them as believing that rationality is an obstacle to nirvana. Affirming contradictions is still irrational, but it is the kind of irrationality needed to do violence to the limits of rationality and transcend them. 

So I think MacIntyre’s unqualified claims about tradition constituting rationality should be limited to claims about other standards for acceptable kinds of evidence, etc. 

**Relativism Objection.**  MacIntyre has himself refuted the charge of relativism multiple times. J. L. A. Smart’s refutation I find the most instructive. 

**Primary Virtue Objection.** Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of virtue is the primary sense? I would disagree that virtues enable an agent to achieve the goods internal to any individual practice (like chess-playing). Those qualities are akin to virtues but not virtues except in a derivative, analogous sense. If I were to emphasize their difference from virtues in the primary sense, I would simply call them individual skills; if I were to emphasize their commonalities, I would call them virtue-skills.  Skills are ‘acquired human characteristics’ that share certain features with virtues: they are habitual, learned, and can contribute to an agent’s character. But they are only derivative in that they contribute to goods of this or that particular practice rather than of the general project of living flourishing human lives. MacIntyre seems to concede this distinction when he concedes that some practices might be oriented toward wicked ends. So virtue-skills are not, by definition, traits that benefit their possessor. 

The second layer of virtue is a skill that emerges within social practices. Skills related to political activity is an example. These skills are not even conceivably individualistic; they are always performed by people with other people within a community. And yet this layer or dimension is not, I would argue, the primary sense of ‘virtue.’ The reason is that communities can be corrupt. An entire social group can engage in a social practice that is itself vicious, that is antithetical to human flourishing. The social practice of trading slaves might be an example. A community composed of members who each have the skill of performing that activity in such a way as to achieve the goods internal to slave-trading would seem to count as “virtuous” by MacIntyre’s loose standard, but this feels forced. The intension of the term ‘virtue’ is partly, by definition, good activities (meaning good for creatures like us). 

So it seems to me important that only MacIntyre’s third layer or dimension of virtue is properly so called. Virtues that contribute to the goods internal to the “practice” of human life as a whole. We must conceive of human life as a narrative unity, with beginning (birth and childhood) middle (maturity and adulthood) and end (decrepitude and death). Those qualities such as courage, moderation, kindness, generosity, affability and so on that contribute to success qua human flourishing are properly virtues. They help us to flourish, they are necessary conditions of a flourishing human person and community. Of course, this is the sense of the term ‘virtue’ that Aristotle gave millennia ago. 

So if only this third dimension of the MacIntyre’s concept of virtue deserves the unqualified epithet ‘virtue,’ and if that concept was already explicated in detail by Aristotle, then is MacIntyre’s painstaking construction of a three-layered account pointless? There is a point of importance to be extracted, I think. That important point can only be seen if one builds up to the concept of virtue from (potentially value-neutral) individual practices or skills to (potentially value-neutral) social practices. 

### Endorsements

One thesis I would like to extract, develop, and defend is this: human practices are necessarily end-directed (teleological). “Social teleology” has at least two and possibly three aspects: individual, collective, and human. The first aspect of social teleology is the end-directed behavior of each agent; the second is the end-directed behavior of social groups, like families, nations, clubs, congregations, and so on. The third, and most objectionable, aspect, is the end-directed activity of our species as a whole. What, if anything, does every human being intentionally pursue? 

The answer to this question is bound to be controversial. But before we try to answer it we can pause and point out that MacIntyre has made the question intelligible and urgent. 

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his (2008) Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought. This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. And if it is correct, it demands the re-evaluation of some cherished assumptions. 
	
	
## Conclusion

MacIntyre’s work is difficult to pick apart and summarize or critique in fragments. The compressions of his orchestral arguments in this chapter are inevitably going to leave some readers dissatisfied, perhaps even dismayed, by what I have made it appear that he is saying. Readers are of course invited to revisit the source. But if my summaries have captured with any accuracy the outline’s of MacIntyre’s contribution to virtue ethics, then we can say a few things with some confidence: virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practicitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. 

Differing traditions explain differing accounts of virtue. Though MacIntyre’s career began in straightforward engagement in dialectical disputes about philosophical ethics, it turned a corner when he thought to treat ethical disagreement in a manner analogous to the way Kuhn treated scientific disagreement. The result of turning this corner — MacIntyre’s own paradigm shift — was an account wherein he argues (similarly to some postmodern philosophers) that malleable traditions define standards of rationality, justice, and virtue. But he also argues, to the chagrin of postmodernists, that traditions are answerable to the world, and can be falsified.  He argues that a thoroughgoing cultural relativism (or “tradition-relativism”?) is inadequate. Such a theory holds the promise to explain why various cultures disagree about what qualities are virtues (humility or pride? acquisitiveness or contentment?) and why the same culture disagrees over time with itself about what exactly defines a particular virtue (is chastity moderation of sexual pleasure or just abstinence?) 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences.

he is pointing out that there are two ways for the project to develop, one where the natural facts are taken to be external to practical reasoning and work upon it, the other where these facts are taken to be an indispensible part of practical reasoning. He rejects the first, both in its own right and as a reading of Foot’s project, and urges the second as the way to go. [3] Instead of seeing McDowell as opposing Foot and her fellows, this paper will follow the line that it is the task of naturalism to give a satisfying account of how it is that natural states of affairs, including crucially what type of creature you are, inform and take their place in practical reasoning.

empirical naturalism, here taken to mean that an empirical study of us and our place in our environment can furnish us with objective facts about our ethical lives. This is done through use of Bernard Williams’s treatment of ‘the representation problem’, which is the observation that when we engage in practical reasoning we do not draw reasons from biological facts in their own right, but instead through some representation of those facts within a culture.

at what type of fact empirical naturalism might refer to as an indication of a good condition for a life-form. Because it builds its ethical view on a foundation of scientifically respectable investigation, we are going to have summations of observations, very much in the form of ‘human beings make more progress in their childhood if they grow up in stable circumstances’ – what Michael Thompson calls 'Aristotelian categoricals'.

2. Empirical Naturalism Because the object of ethical investigation is the lives of agents, there seems little reason not to find matters of ethical significance in the life-sciences. For instance, it seems a simple matter of fact that you get healthier organisms and less healthy ones, and it us up to biology to explain what it is for some organism to be better-off. It is easy enough to see how quite rich notions such as healthiness and fitness in one’s environment could be extended further until they give a plausible naturalistic theory of well-being.

For argument’s sake, let us say that some biological facts give us a reason to act one way rather than another. According to empirical naturalism, we have this reason in virtue of the type of beings that we are, that is, our human nature presses on us this course of action. There are two ways in which this could go, but together they form a dilemma in which empirical naturalism is caught. Firstly, to some degree or another, the directive might show itself as a disposition to act in the relevant way which is placed by nature in the agent.

once one generation has been raised by a home-bound mother, her daughters have that precedent to follow when they themselves start families, and, if they continue on the same track, their daughters have the precedent of two generations, and theirs three, and so on. At what point, if any, are the reasons for living that way still biological rather than institutional? That is the representation problem: the courses of action we have empirical naturalistic reasons to adopt cannot straightforwardly be separated from the directives of our culture.

If we do not accept this, we need to explain the fact that certain objects of our observation seem to act defectively in systematic ways but without harm coming to it. Without setting such a limit on diversification of forms of life, there will be no way for the excellence naturalist to draw reasons for action for particular states of affairs, because on this account recognising reasons depends on recognising forms of life.

For all its failings, empirical naturalism doesn’t share this problem: there is a straightforward way to draw moral conclusions from available biological facts. Excellence naturalism has a far more satisfactory account of reasons, but does so at the cost of adding another layer of sophistication. It needs to move from available biological fact to distinctive forms of life, and from those to moral conclusions.

What about things no one has thought of yet, but that are logically possible? They exist only potentially. Those thoughts do not actually exist until, in fact, they actually exist. If they could exist before that, then they would have to be supernatural (because they would then have to be irreducibly mental). What does it mean to potentially exist but not actually exist? It means the physical universe is capable of producing such things in the right conditions, yet those conditions still do not require anything irreducibly mental (or if they did, then naturalism would be false).

Because a potential ratio can be a ratio of anything possessing the property of quantity. Hence, obviously when we think solely of the ratio we leave blank what it is a ratio of, we thus "abstract" the ratio from its particular instances, and the resulting impression is of a number divorced from any physical fact. But that's an illusion, if we take it as anything other than a formalism of physical computation ("x:y = 326,519,438.004:1" where x and y = "wires or sticks or pounds or persons or...[ ad infinitum]," there being too many possibilities to state or imagine all at once, so we don't). This was explicitly stated and explained by Aristotle over two thousand years ago. Someone really ought to get the memo. Even when abstracted, a word like 326,519,438.004 is meaningless unless it describes some actual or hypothetical ratio between physical quantities. The blank must be potentially fillable. Otherwise numbers would be meaningless sounds. (I discuss this mistake more broadly in Sense and Goodness without God, pp. 31-32, essential to which is the whole discussion of pp. 29-35).

            <Text>### Theorist of Rationality ###

MacIntyre is a theorist of rationality (and of practical rationality and hence virtue). Hence rationally to assess his theory requires thinking through our own theory of rationality. But thinking about rationality is thinking through our own thinking. The errors we make in thinking are likely to be underscored by our attempts to *think them through*. The Greek proverb is: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” If something is deeply wrong with the way we think, how can theorizing about rationality right the wrong? The Latin proverb (from a very different context) is “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” — who will guard the guards themselves? I believe the answer to the rhetorical question is no one at all can guard the guards. If water chokes us, there is nothing we can do to wash it down and clear our throat. Similarly, some of the errors MacIntyre diagnoses in thinkers who belong to the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition will be invisible to those thinkers. 

Even if MacIntyre’s diagnosis is *correct*, especially if it is correct, the patient will find the diagnosis unintelligible, even irrational. Insofar as the patient finds any parts of his theory intelligible, they will seem radical, disastrous in their social implications, and destructive of the very nature and purpose of education. The reason these appearances will be insuperable to MacIntyre’s patient is because the patient is, by his lights, self-deceived. He or she simply denies being part of a tradition, and hence denies having a particular (rather than universal) tradition-bound conception of rationality, and hence denies having a particular, tradition-bound conception of the good (perhaps the good is unbounded freedom to follow the moral law, or to pursue happiness,, and justice unfettered equality). Modernity is the “tradition-less tradition” and hence *must* deny tradition to be consistent with itself. 

### Audience is discontented folks ###

But *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and others are directed toward the discontented liberal modern. This patient comes to MacIntyre with manifesting symptoms. MacIntyre offers one possible diagnosis, and the patient’s job is to investigate further. The patient needs philosophical imagination to even *consider* the possibility of another truth. The patient needs patience, intellectual courage, and self-reflection. The patient needs to sit in front of the proverbial mirror and mouth the words, (a) “I am part of a tradition” and (b) “my tradition might be inadequate,” and (c) “that other tradition might have the resources more adequately to address the intellectual and practical problems that I now see are insuperable to my tradition.” 

It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

Nevertheless, some (like Nagel) are surprised and perhaps even offended when the religious philosopher (like MacIntyre) concludes upon decades of reflection that his secular colleague is less than rational. No! Nagel protests, the religious philosophers is less than rational — my secularism is by definition an allegiance to rationality over dogma. But Lutz rightly disentangles this web of definitional fiat and counter-fiat. If Nagel’s secularism is a dogma, and one unsustainable after decades of the most open-minded reflection upon best evidence, then the secular philosopher is not just mistaken but irrational. If this result seems surprising to the reader, it is a likely sign that MacIntyre’s theory has not yet been grasped. 

Nagel’s inability or unwillingness to consider that his secularism is a dogma or ideology would put disadvantage him relative to MacIntyre. For Nagel’s part, he *does* self-reflectively consider it, but does not express the further willingness to imaginatively and philosophically entertain the opposing tradition’s account. 

Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side just isn’t doing philosophy anymore. My only point here is that which side it is is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal, secular philosophers that MacIntyerean-type “philosophy” just isn’t.  It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian, religious philosophers that Nagalean “philosophy” just isn’t.

While I agree with much of MacIntyre’s picture of the development of western civilization, there is far more in his proposals than I can comment on, let alone defend. Instead, I’ll surface and discuss a few particular objections. </Text>

            <Title>Street, Sharon A Darwinian Dilemma for Moral Realism</Title>
            <Text>Buhler Summary: 
Street’s influential essay presents moral realists of any stripe with a dilemma. Moral realists are those claim that “there are evaluative facts or truths that hold independently of all our evaluative attitudes (now keeping in mind the qualification about stance-independence).” 

The dilemma in short is this: If there is no relation between evolutionary influences on our evaluative attitudes and independent evaluative truths, then “most of our evaluative judgments are off track due to the distorting pressure of Darwinian forces”; if there is a relation between evolutionary influences on our evaluative attitudes and independent evaluative truths, then the unscientific conclusion follows that “natural selection favored ancestors who were able to grasp [evaluative] truths”. Either there is a relation between evolutionary influences on our attitudes and independent truths or there is no relation. So either most of our evaluative judgments are false because of Darwinian influence (which entails skepticism) or natural selection favored ancestors who were able to grasp evaluative truths (which is unscientific). 



She says, “If we take this point and combine it with the first premise that our evaluative judgments have been tremendously shaped by Darwinian influence, then we are left with the implausible skeptical conclusion that our evaluative judgments are in all likelihood mostly off track, for our system of evaluative judgments is revealed to be utterly saturated and contaminated with illegitimate influence. We should have been evolving towards affirming the independent evaluative truths posited by the realist, but instead it turns out that we have been evolving towards affirming whatever evaluative content tends to promote reproductive success” (Street 14 %).

A Response:

The challenge of the dilemma applies to moral realists who accept that “evolutionary forces have played a tremendous role in shaping the content of human evaluative attitudes” (Street 1 %). She avers that the dilemma can be sidestepped by anti-realism. But three other responses are possible. 
The first is to run between the horns. Erik Wielenburg runs between the horns. If the relation between evolutionary forces and our evaluative judgments is different, then the dilemma breaks down. For Wielenburg, the emergence of the capacity to recognize moral rights coincides with the emergence of moral rights. He assumes that we have certain beliefs about personal space and the wrongness of transgressing personal space. You may not torture me for fun, I may not torture you  for fun. The fact that it is wrong supervenes on my cognitivefaculties, the same faculties with which I recognizeThe fact that it is wrong. Wielenburg argument parallels the argument of Robert George that our moral rights are grounded in our rational nature. Having a rational nature entails having certain rights; having a rational nature entails the capacity (realized or not) to develop the ability to recognize that all creatures with rational natures (both ourselves and others) have rights. (Wielenburg, On Evolutionary Debunking Arguments %) 

The second is to grab one horn. Nagel admits that the dilemma can be sidestepped by loosening the dogmatic hold that devotion to Darwinism has over us. 

The third is a counter-dilemma. For example, we could argue that Street’s essay proves that either epistemic realism (tantamount to rationality rather than idiocy) is false or moral realism is true. If moral realism is false, then epistemic realism is false. But if epistemic realism is true, then moral realism is true. And either moral realism is false (due to the saturation of non-truth-tracking Darwinian influences) or epistemic realism is true (because if we do not believe this we would not read or write philosophical articles about moral realism — or anything else). 
She tries to block this objection: “If one holds that the assessment of (non-evaluative) factual judgments also proceeds via reflective equilibrium, one might wonder why the points in this paragraph don’t apply equally well to rational reflection about scientific matters (for example). The key difference is that in the scientific case, our “starting fund” of (non-evaluative) factual judgments need not be viewed as mostly ‘off track.’” This is a flimsy block for an objection that, if successful, would flood and destroy not only her argument but all rational argumentation. 

To the counter-dilemma and to Street, Thomas Nagel provides adequate response. Thomas Nagel’s Last Word is a defense of objective rationality against all the forces of irrationality that would slander it. Irrationality cannot, of course, argue against rationality because argument is one of rationality’s own tools. But irrationality can construct mock arguments. 
Thomas Nagel’s Mind and Cosmos (among others) is a defense of objective value against all the forces of immorality that would slander it. I take his arguments to be decisive.

There are different brands of realism about value. What unites them is the view that there are evaluative facts or truths that hold independently of all our evaluative attitudes (now keeping in mind the qualification about stance-independence). What separates different kinds of realists from one another is how they construe the nature of these facts or truths. According to what I will call non-naturalist versions of value realism, evaluative facts or truths are not reducible to any kind of natural fact, and are not the kinds of things that play a role in causal explanations; instead, they are irreducibly normative facts or truths.4 This brand of realism has been gaining increasing numbers of adherents in recent years, and it lies squarely within the target of the Darwinian Dilemma.

only reasonable to expect there to have been, over the course of our evolutionary history, relentless selective pressure on the content of our evaluative judgments, or rather (as I discuss below) “proto” versions thereof. In particular, we can expect there to have been overwhelming pressure in the direction of making those evaluative judgments which tended to promote reproductive success (such as the judgment that one’s life is valuable), and against making those evaluative judgments which tended to decrease reproductive success (such as the judgment that one should attack one’s offspring). The hypothesis that this is indeed very roughly what happened is borne out by the patterns of evaluative judgment that we observe in human beings today. There is, of course, a seemingly unlimited diversity to the evaluative judgments that human beings affirm. Yet even as we note this diversity, we also see deep and striking patterns, across both time and cultures, in many of the most basic evaluative judgments that human beings tend to make. Consider, as a brief sampling, the following judgments about reasons:

deeply and widely held judgments, we observe many like those on the first list—many with exactly the sort of content one would expect if the content of our evaluative judgments had been heavily influenced by selective pressures. In this way, the observed patterns in the actual content of human evaluative judgments provide evidence in favor of the view that natural selection has had a tremendous influence on that content. A further piece of evidence in favor of this view is the striking continuity that we observe between many of our own widely held evaluative judgments and the more basic evaluative tendencies of other animals, especially those most closely related to us. It does not seem much of a stretch, for example, to say that chimpanzees, in some primitive, non-linguistic sort of fashion, experience certain things in the world as calling for or counting in favor of certain reactions on their part. Moreover, the content of these evaluative experiences seems to overlap significantly with the content of many of our own evaluative tendencies. Like us, individual chimpanzees seem to experience—at some basic motivational level—actions that would promote their survival or help their offspring as in some way “called for.” More strikingly, and again at some basic motivational level, chimpanzees seem to experience the fact that another chimpanzee has helped them, whether by sharing food, grooming them, or supporting their position within the group hierarchy, as “counting in favor of” assisting that other individual in similar

Now note two important complications to this rough evolutionary sketch. First of all, the discussion so far might have suggested that things happened this way: first our ancestors began making evaluative judgments, and then tendencies to make some of these evaluative judgments rather than others were selected for. In other words, first came the capacity to make evaluative judgments, and then followed the selection of their content. But the actual course of evolution certainly did not take place in these two stages, much less in that order.

Presumably in these and other such cases our system of full-fledged, reflective evaluative judgments would have looked very different as well, and in ways that loosely reflected the basic evaluative tendencies in question. My conclusion: The content of human evaluative judgments has been tremendously influenced—indirectly influenced, in the way I have indicated, but nevertheless tremendously influenced—by the forces of natural selection, such that our system of evaluative judgments is saturated with evolutionary influence.

Where I think the objection goes wrong, then, is as follows. The objection gains its plausibility by suggesting that rational reflection provides some means of standing apart from our evaluative judgments, sorting through them, and gradually separating out the true ones from the false—as if with the aid of some uncontaminated tool. But this picture cannot be right.

Rational reflection must always proceed from some evaluative standpoint; it must work from some evaluative premises; it must treat some evaluative judgments as fixed, if only for the time being, as the assessment of other evaluative judgments is undertaken. In rational reflection, one does not stand completely apart from one’s starting fund of evaluative judgments: rather, one uses them, reasons in terms of them, holds some of them up for examination in light of others. The widespread consensus that the method of reflective equilibrium, broadly understood, is our sole means of proceeding in ethics is an acknowledgment of this fact: ultimately, we can test our evaluative judgments only by testing their consistency with our other evaluative judgments, combined of course with judgments about the (non evaluative) facts. Thus, if the fund of evaluative judgments with which human reflection began was thoroughly contaminated with illegitimate influence—and the objector has offered no reason to doubt this part of the argument—then the tools of rational reflection were equally contaminated, for the latter are always just a subset of the former. It follows that all our reflection over the ages has really just been a process of assessing evaluative judgments that are mostly off the mark in terms of others that are mostly off the mark.

If one holds that the assessment of (non-evaluative) factual judgments also proceeds via reflective equilibrium, one might wonder why the points in this paragraph don’t apply equally well to rational reflection about scientific matters (for example). The key difference is that in the scientific case, our “starting fund” of (non-evaluative) factual judgments need not be viewed as mostly “off track.”

It is actually quite clear, the realist might say, how we should understand the relation between selective pressures and independent evaluative truths. The answer is this: we may understand these evolutionary causes as having tracked the truth; we may understand the relation in question to be a tracking relation.26

As we have seen, according to the tracking account, making certain evaluative judgments rather than others promoted reproductive success because these judgments were true. But let’s now look at this. How exactly is this supposed to work? Exactly why would it promote an organism’s reproductive success to grasp the independent evaluative truths posited by the realist? The realist owes us an answer here. It is not enough to say: “Because they are true.” We need to know more about why it is advantageous to apprehend such truths before we have been given an adequate explanation.

To return to our original questions, why do we tend to judge that our survival is valuable, rather than worthless? Why do we tend to judge that we have special obligations to care for our children, rather than strangers or distant relatives? Why do we tend to view the killing of other human beings as a much more serious matter than the killing of plants or other animals? The adaptive link account has very good answers to such questions, of the general form that ancestors who made evaluative judgments of these kinds, and who as a result tended to respond to their circumstances in the ways demanded by these judgments, did better in terms of reproductive success than their counterparts.

To sum up, the set of evaluative judgments that human beings tend to affirm appears to be a disparate mishmash, ranging across all kinds of unrelated spheres and reflecting all kinds of unrelated values—some self-interested, others family-related, still others concerning how we should treat non relatives and other forms of life, and so on. The power of the adaptive link account is that it exposes much of this seeming unrelatedness as an illusion; it illuminates a striking, previously hidden unity behind many of our most basic evaluative judgments, namely that they forge links between circumstance and response that would have been likely to promote reproductive success in the environments of our ancestors. The tracking account has no comparable explanatory power.

Does the view in question understand evaluative truths as holding, in a fully robust way, independently of all our evaluative attitudes? Suppose the value naturalist takes the following view. Given that we have the evaluative attitudes we do, evaluative facts are identical with natural facts N. But if we had possessed a completely different set of evaluative attitudes, the evaluative facts would have been identical with the very different natural facts M. Such a view does not count as genuinely realist in my taxonomy, for such a view makes it dependent on our evaluative attitudes which natural facts evaluative facts are identical with. On such a view, there is an important sense in which we need only alter our evaluative attitudes in order to change the evaluative facts, for by altering our evaluative attitudes we change which natural facts the evaluative facts are identical with. Views of this kind count as antirealist in my taxonomy, and as such are not a target of my argument; instead they escape the Darwinian Dilemma in the way I discuss in section 10.

Peter Railton’s account of individual non-moral good is an example of such a view.41 According to Railton’s proposal, roughly understood, an individual’s non-moral good is identical to what that person would desire to desire under conditions of full information. Suppose, then, that what Ann would desire to desire under conditions of full information is (in part) her own longevity. In that case, her individual non moral good is identical (in part) to her own longevity. But now suppose that Ann undergoes a significant change in her evaluative attitudes, such that it is no longer true of her that under conditions of full information she would desire to desire her own longevity. In that case, her individual non-moral good is no longer identical to her longevity, but is instead identical to something else (whatever it is that she’d now desire to desire under conditions of full information). There is an important sense in which Ann need only alter her evaluative attitudes in order to change the evaluative facts, for by altering her evaluative attitudes she changes which natural facts the evaluative facts are identical with. Railton’s proposal therefore counts as antirealist in my taxonomy.42

In sum, what I will call genuinely realist versions of value naturalism hold that which natural facts evaluative facts are identical with is independent of all our evaluative attitudes, and they do not achieve this result by means of the rigidifying move. When it comes to the case just sketched, a genuinely realist version of value naturalism will hold that even if the two communities’ uses of the word ‘good’ track different natural properties, the communities are nevertheless (at least potentially) using the word ‘good’ in the same sense—genuinely disagreeing with one another about the correct natural normative identity—and that there is a fact of the matter about which (if either) of us is right that obtains independently of all of our and their evaluative attitudes.46

Many human capacities, after all, are like this: our ability to do astrophysics, for instance, was surely not itself directly selected for, but is instead the byproduct or outgrowth of other capacities which likely do have an explanation in terms of natural selection. Perhaps in some similar fashion our ability to grasp independent evaluative truths has emerged as a byproduct or outgrowth of some other capacity—call it capacity C.

The case of physical pain—for instance, in the various forms associated with burns, cuts, bruises, broken bones, nausea, and headaches—serves as one of the strongest temptations toward realism about value. Realists frequently appeal to the case of pain when defending their views,52 and when presented with the Darwinian Dilemma, another such appeal may seem attractive. One possibility is for the realist to argue along the following lines. There are obvious evolutionary explanations of why we tend to feel physical pain when we do: roughly, we tend to feel it in conjunction with bodily conditions or events that diminish reproductive success, such as a cut to the skin or a blow to the head.

            <Title>Finish Finlay’s article on Moral Realism’s Four Faces</Title>
            <Text>Stephen Finlay’s “Four Faces of Moral Realism” aims to explain the contours of the various philosophical debates that fly under the heading of ‘moral realism.’ He maps the contours of those debates along four “faces” and two poles. The four faces he refers to are: semantic, ontological, metaphysical, and normative.  The two poles providing “dialectical pressure” are:  “capturing the moral appearances” — we must do justice to what very obviously seems to be the case about me and you and human nature; the second is “reconciling morality with our understanding of the mind and world” — we must do justice to what also obviously seems to be the case about the physical world studied by physical sciences. 

Using this map, Finlay critical surveys the schools of thought represented in the recent scholarship: expressivism and pragmatist nondescriptivism, subjectivist and nonsubjectivist naturalism, nonnaturalism, and error theory. 

The contemporary iteration of debates about moral realism stem from G. E. Moore and have become a “tangled and bewildering web.” There is no consensus as to what ‘realism’ means. Finlay’s first and admittedly vague attempt to capture ‘realism’ is “some kind or other of independence from people’s attitudes or practices” (1). But characterizing this kind of independence is difficult. Also, some writers do and some do not distinguish the relation between evaluative moral claims and other kinds of evaluative or normative claims. 

With these distinctions in mind, Finlay offers a diagram. Moving down the Y axis, we ask for progressively more involved commitments to moral realism, beginning with a semantic question (“Do moral claims have truth-values?”) through two ontological questions, one “metaphysical”, and ending with two normative questions. 

The six questions are these: do moral claims have truth values? If so, do moral claims aim to describe moral facts? If so, do moral claims ever successfully describe such facts? If so, are moral entities/properties attitude-independent (or mind-independent, or stance-independent)? If so, do moral entities/properties have attitude-independent authority? If so, are moral entities/properties reducible to nonmoral ones? 

The “robust moral realist” (perhaps the “stark raving moral realist” to borrow Railton’s playful description) answers in the affirmative all the way down. 

But the philosopher who wants to claim the title realist and only answer Yes to some sub-set of the questions may do so without too much trepidation. The philosopher who answers one or more of the questions in the negative may be helpfully titled as an antirealist at least in that respect.

            <Text>## Chapter Conclusion ##

MacIntyre’s work is difficult to pick apart and summarize or critique in fragments. The compressions of his orchestral arguments in this chapter are inevitably going to leave some readers dissatisfied, perhaps even dismayed, by his theories. what I have made it appear that he is saying. Readers are of course invited to revisit the source. But if my summaries have captured with any accuracy the outline’s of MacIntyre’s contribution to virtue ethics, then we can say a few things with some confidence: virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. 

Differing traditions explain differing accounts of virtue. Though MacIntyre’s career began in straightforward engagement in dialectical disputes about philosophical ethics, it turned a corner when he thought to treat ethical disagreement in a manner analogous to the way Kuhn treated scientific disagreement. The result of turning this corner — MacIntyre’s own paradigm shift — was an account wherein he argues (similarly to some postmodern philosophers) that malleable traditions define standards of rationality, justice, and virtue. But he also argues, to the chagrin of postmodernists, that traditions are answerable to the world, and can be falsified.  He argues that a thoroughgoing cultural relativism (or “tradition-relativism”?) is inadequate. Such a theory holds the promise to explain why various cultures disagree about what qualities are virtues (humility or pride? acquisitiveness or contentment?) and why the same culture disagrees over time with itself about what exactly defines a particular virtue (is chastity moderation of sexual pleasure or just abstinence?) 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


### Chapter Conclusion There are probably natural teloi as well

Now, MacIntyre later changed his mind about the "metaphysical biology" objection. He later thought that it could be answered a second time, even more strongly. It is not just *social teleology* that necessarily exists as part of our human nature; teleology is in some sense part of non-human nature as well. He came to accept the Thomistic and ultimately Aristotelian argument that natural causes include both efficient/material causes and formal/final. He, along with many others, came to believe that modern science has succeeded *in part because of* an enduring belief in final causation or natural teleology, not because of a rejection. The story about scientists dispensing with final causes in biology and astronomy and chemistry is largely a myth. Scientists and philosophers of science abound who can give empirical and rational grounds for thinking nature is riddled with final causation. 

MacIntyre's *ethical* case does not depend on this more robust account of natural teleology. All it needs is social teleology. But if it turned out that social teleology was in *instance* of natural teleology -- that the ends of human nature were a type of the ends of nature per se -- then the framework in which virtues enable the achievement of human ends would certainly be given additional credibility. 

Making the case on behalf of natural teleology I shall not do here. That is a task for the next chapter.

            <Title>David Enoch</Title>
            <Text>##David Enoch — Taking Morality Seriously 

Another recent thinker who has advanced a thesis with some similarities is Israeli philosopher David Enoch. David Enoch's persuasive argument is that any alternative to objectivist moral realism, whatever its merits, doesn't account for or allow us to take morality sufficiently seriously -- as seriously as we already do, or as seriously as we must do — especially for deliberation about what to do. Moral realism of the robust sort gains its plausibility from allowing or explaining why we take morality just so seriously -- as serious as life and death. 

Enoch's claim is not the same as Nagel's, but bears an important relation: Nagel claims that reasoning as if morality were objective is practically necessary, that we cannot but do so. Enoch claims that since we reason as if morality were objective (we take it very seriously) we ought to explain the fact by the best explanation, namely that morality is indeed objective. 

I take these claims together to be an explanandum and explanans. There are many ways of trying to convince people to take morality less seriously, by showing it up, by exposing it, deflating it, showing what moral claims "really" amount to, and so on. Peter Railton claims that some people can take morality too seriously even though they are avowed subjectivists. He says 

“Some may be drawn to, or repelled by, moral realism out of a sense that it is the view of ethics that best expresses high moral earnestness. Yet one can be serious about morality, even to a fault, without being a moral realist. Indeed, a possible objection to the sort of moral realism I will defend here is that it may not make morality serious enough” (Railton, “Moral Realism” 164). 

An objection Enoch might make (or that I shall make in a Enochian spirit) is that there are two kinds of earnestness. One is an earnestness in doing good. The other is an inevitable earnestness in caring about what we do when we deliberate. Enoch emphasises the second. Railton’s non-reductive but naturalistic morality may account for the fact that people sincerely and eagerly care about doing right but it doesn’t account for the way we in fact deliberate. 
Enoch summarizes his moral realism in this way: 

&gt;"I believe that there are irreducibly normative truths and facts, facts such that we should care about our future well-being, that we should not humiliate other people, that we should not reason and form beliefs in ways we know to be unreliable. These are, of course, just examples: even if I am wrong about them, I believe there must be some examples of this sort, examples of normative (and indeed moral) truths that are irreducibly normative, truths that are perfectly objective, universal, absolute. They are independent of us, our desires and our (or anyone else’s) will. And our thinking and talking about them amounts not just to an expression of any practical attitudes, but to a representation of these normative truths and facts. These normative truths are truths that, when successful in our normative inquiries, we discover rather than create or construct. They are, in other words, just as respectable as empirical or mathematical truths (at least, that is, according to scientific and mathematical realists)." 

##David Enoch Chapter 3 - Argument from Deliberative Indespensibility

Enoch’s book defends moral realism against various familiar or not-so-familiar objections. His primary positive argument for moral realism (or what he calls “robust moral realism”) is, in short, that normative facts feature indispensibly in our deliberation and tha the reality of normative facts is the best explanation of that indispensability. He says, “ I argue that irreducibly normative truths, though not explanatorily indispensable, are nevertheless deliberatively indispensable – they are, in other words, indispensable for the project of deliberating and deciding what to do – and that this kind of indispensability is just as respectable as the more familiar explanatory kind. Deliberative indispensability, I argue, justifies belief in normative facts, just like the explanatory indispensability of theoretical entities like electrons justifies belief in electrons.” (Enoch 2011, 50; Enoch 50)

We can trace a prototypical version of this argument from deliberative indespensibility to Plato’s Parmenides.  In this most difficult of Platonic texts, Parmenides (the character) advances “the most difficult” objections to realism about universals, and despite Socrates (the character)’s inability to respond to them, affirms realism. Why? In the absence of appropriate rebuttals of objections, why retain the belief? Because the alternative thesis is impossible to rationally maintain. 

“But on the other hand,” said Parmenides, “if anyone, with his mind fixed on all these objections and others like them, denies the existence of ideas of things, and does not assume an idea under which each individual thing is classed, he will be quite at a loss,  since he denies that the idea of each thing is always the same, and in this way he will utterly destroy the power of carrying on discussion. You seem to have been well aware of this.” “Quite true,” he said.“Then what will become of philosophy? To what can you turn, if these things are unknown?” (134-135c). 

Philosophical theories that are self-refuting or doctrines which are sets of propositions of which some contradict each other are theoretically impossible to affirm. Similarly, practical maxims that are self-refuting are impossible to act upon. Reality (formal reality) is what philosophical inquiry is about.  If philosophical inquiry is just about our shared concepts, or just about the history of falsehoods held by great dead philosophers, or just about rationality itself, then we had better use our time elsewhere. 

Enoch doesn’t think that there have been any good or good enough response to Gilbert Harman’s challenge that unless normative facts can feature in our best explanations. “The general thought seems clear enough: moral facts do not play an appropriate explanatory role (the No Explanatory Role Thesis), and, given that playing such a role is necessary for justified belief in the existence of a kind of fact (the Explanatory Requirement), we are not justified in believing in moral facts”  (Enoch 52). In a footnote, Enoch distinguishes his account from that of Regan: “An emphasis on the point of view of the deliberating agent – central to my employment of the second strategy of coping with Harman’s Challenge – can be found in Regan (2003) and Rosati (2003). At times, Regan’s claims are very close to my own, except he thinks such line of thought only defends realism “for practical purposes” (2003, 656).

Enoch addresses a preliminary worry or objection that something’s indespensibility need not signify its truth or reality. But the same (or indistinguishably similar) worry would have to be applied to electrons and numbers. Rather, he appeals to the properly basic procedure of concluding that something exists on the basis of its indispensability to certain kinds of explanation. “We usually take that something is theoretically useful to be reason to believe it, and perhaps we should rest content with that as a fairly basic epistemic procedure, as one place where epistemic justification comes to an end.” Enoch defends the proposition that inference to the best explanation is a properly basic epistemic procedure, like relying on modus ponens or perception or memory. 


Enoch distinguishes explanatory indispensability from deliberative indispensabilty, which he explains this way:  “Something is instrumentally indispensable for a project, I suggest, just in case it cannot be eliminated without undermining (or at least sufficiently diminishing) whatever reason we had to engage in that project in the first place; without, in other words, thereby defeating whatever reason we had to find that project attractive” (69).

In short: “The deliberative project is, then, intrinsically indispensable (or at least – it is intrinsically indispensable if the explanatory one is). If it is instrumentally indispensable for the deliberative project that p, we are justified in believing that p. At least, we are every bit as justified in so believing as we are in believing the conclusions of inferences to the best explanation (from warranted premises). If, then, it can be established that irreducibly normative truths are deliberatively indispensable, we are every bit as justified in believing in them as we are in believing in the explanation-friendliness of the universe, and, derivatively, in electrons” (71).

Terence Cuneo explores indispensability in this way: 
An “elimination stopper” is something that is “necessary for engaging in anything we would ordinarily recognize as theorizing” (Cuneo 229). 
“Theorizing—that is, accepting, evaluating, and formulating theories (however inchoate in character) of various kinds—is arguably an unavoidable practice for ordinary human agents; it is difficult to imagine a recognizably human way of life in which we do not engage in it. If this is right, it follows that epistemic facts are indispensable in at least this sense: They are such that participation in certain practices that are themselves practically unavoidable commits us to their existence.1”
	Certain epistemic norms are just so indispensable. 


Enoch then argues that deliberation is just so indispensable. There are arbitrary choices (between this or that cereal) and there are choices where the outcome really just depends on you or your choice (how happy will I be in profession X?) But in deliberating we “attempt to eliminate arbitrariness by discovering (normative) reasons, and it is impossible in a believe absence of such reasons to be discovered” (74). In some cases of choosing, you “commit yourself to there being (normative) reasons relevant to your deliberation. 

One review summarizes the argument in this way: 

(1) Moral beliefs concern something objective. (2) If Robust normative facts are indispensable for deliberation, we have some reason to believe in them, and thus to accept Robust Metanormative Realism. (3) Insofar as we have reason to accept Robust Metanormative Realism, we have reason to accept Robust Metaethical Realism. (4) Robust normative facts are indispensable for deliberation because alternatives to Robust Realism that are consistent with (1) and with normativity’s role in deliberation fail. (5) None of the metaphysical, epistemological, semantic or psychological objections to Robust Realism are significantly damaging. (6) Therefore, we have most reason to accept Robust Realism in both metaethics and metanormative theory. (David Faraci’s review, accessed online http://personal.bgsu.edu/~faracid/pubs/enoch.pdf
 I argue that iexplrreducibly normative truths, though not explanatorily indispensable, are nevertheless deliberatively indispensable – they are, in other words, indispensable for the project of deliberating and deciding what to do – and that this kind of indispensability is just as respectable as the more familiar explanatory kind. Deliberative indispensability, I argue, justifies belief in normative facts, just like the explanatory indispensability of theoretical entities like electrons justifies belief in electrons. 

##David Enoch, Chapter 4 - And Now, Robust Metaethical Realism

Enoch argues that moral normativity is a species of normativity, and that the distinction between normative and non-normative is much more important than the distinction between moral norm and non-moral norm. 

“With this point in mind, then, asking about the relations between the moral and the normative becomes the question of how to delineate the moral within the normative. What more, in other words, does it take for a normative truth (or falsehood) to qualify as moral? Morality is a particular instance of normativity, and so we are now in effect asking about its distinctive characteristics, the ones that serve to distinguish between the moral and the rest of the normative.
I do not have a view on these special characteristics of the moral. In fact, I think that for most purposes this is not a line worth worrying about. The distinction within the normative between the moral and the non-moral seems to me to be shallow compared to the distinction between the normative and the non-normative – both philosophically, as I am about to argue, and practically. (Once you know you have a reason to ф and what this reason is, does it really matter for your deliberation whether it qualifies as a moral reason?)” (Enoch 86). 

His argument does not depend essentially on distinguishing moral norms from non-moral norms (88). 

&gt;“Why are people so suspicious of morality, robust-realistically understood? Sometimes the worries are metaphysical – moral properties, or truths, or facts, or values, or duties, or some such are said to be metaphysically queer, not to find a comfortable place in a naturalistic worldview, and so on. The merits of such worries are a matter for Chapter 6, but my point here is much more limited: if you think that things like the purported fact that we ought not to humiliate others is metaphysically queer, you should be equally metaphysically suspicious of things like the purported fact that two-boxing is the uniquely rational policy in Newcomb’s Problem. If you find it hard to metaphysically stomach things like the value of humanity (or the negative value of pain), you shouldn’t (prima facie, at least) find the value of excitement more appetizing. If the scientific worldview can’t find room for the wrongness of murder, it is hard to see how it can find room for the irrationality and (sometimes) irresponsibility involved in wishful thinking. The metaphysical worries about morality seem to just be instances of metaphysical worries about normativity more generally.”

In short, if one finds false the notion that all reality is ultimately material, is there any *other* reason to doubt moral realism? Moral disagreement is the greatest one. Moral disagreement is an especially cutting objection against virtue ethics. 

Enoch’s discussion of the (supposedly) devastating objection that moral properties or moral entities, if they existed, would be queer. He clarifies and diffuses many iterations of this objection.  Section 4.3 suggests that moral realism is “especially suspicious” among metanormative theories because moral reasons are categorical (93). There is a difference here between realism about (say) epistemic norms and realism about moral norms which are or are supposed to relate somehow with our motivations. 

Enoch’s fourth chapter ends with a kind of challenge.  In the absences of better objections to his view or arguments in favor of rival views, he conjectures “that no such further consideration can be found. But my argument here is open-ended in this way, and so my conclusion can perhaps better be thought of as a challenge: if you cannot find a flaw with the arguments of the two previous chapters, but want to resist the further conclusion of Robust Metaethical Realism, you had better be able to come up with a rationale for the surprising combination of views you find yourself with” (99). 

David Enoch Chapter 5 Doing with Less - Against naturalism)
“This chapter critically discusses three families of attempts to give the metaethical or meta-normative realist pretty much all that she wants, without resorting to the metaphysical extravagance of Robust Realism. The first is an attempt at a kind of naturalism that accommodates (by reduction, with this word sufficiently broadly understood) normativity. Naturalism is rejected mostly by emphasizing the thought that normative truths and facts are just too different from natural ones to be a subset thereof.”

Most to my purposes, in its way, is Enoch’s fifth chapter. He characterizes the naturalistic viewpoint by first stating a few possible theses that would qualify as naturalistic: 

&gt;“Now, as already hinted, it’s not clear what the precise naturalist claim would be.2 Suggestions in this area include things like the following: normative facts just are (identical with) natural facts; normative facts are reducible to natural ones; normative facts are metaphysically grounded in natural ones; normative facts are constituted by natural facts. And further distinctions may be relevant here. For instance, we may want to distinguish – even if we’ve settled on an identity claim – between type–type and token–token identity. Furthermore, it’s not as if the terms just used (in any of these suggestions) are philosophically transparent. It is, after all, not at all clear, and far less is it uncontroversial, how reduction is best understood, or how grounding is to be distinguished from constitution, or – perhaps most clearly – how the natural is to be understood and delineated. So there are many, many suggestions that a fuller philosophical treatment would have to distinguish and evaluate piecemeal. Without pretending to cover everything in the neighborhood that needs covering, then, let me make a fairly concrete suggestion about how to capture the naturalist thought, and then argue against it. I have to concede, though, that nothing here will qualify as a conclusive argument, much less will it qualify as a conclusive argument against all possible roughly-speaking-naturalist positions here” (101). 


What Enoch settles on is what he calls the nothing-over-and-above relation. In the debate, robust moral realists affirm the resolution that there are moral facts (or properties or truths etc.) over and above the natural facts; naturalists deny the resolution. 

&gt;“When I speak of irreducibly normative (and moral) facts, I use the term “reduction” and its relatives somewhat loosely, to pick out the nothing-over-and-above relation. According to Robust Realism, then, there are moral and other normative facts that are not merely natural ones; according to Robust Realism it is just false to say of (all) the normative facts that they are nothing over and above natural ones. The relation between the normative facts and the natural ones is not like that between statues and “their” lumps of clay, or between chair-facts and facts about their structure and function,7 or between mental facts and physical facts (according to the monist)” (102).

Elsewhere (Enoch 2003, 2007a) I argue that our main reason to believe in metaethical or metanormative realism is not based on the role moral truths, facts and properties may have in explaining agreement (or, for that matter, any other phenomenon), but rather on the role they play in our deliberation about what to do. Even if such facts and properties are explanatorily dispensable, I argue, they are delibemtively indispensable - we cannot in good faith deliberate about what to do without believing in them - and there is no non-question-begging reason to take explanatory but not deliberative indispensability seriously.

Tersman (2006, p. 85) claims that his related points apply to non-naturalist as well as naturalist realist views. But it seems to me that Tersman's characterization of realism - and in particular, his emphasis on the continuity of moral and natural facts (2006, e.g. 98) - in fact shows otherwise.

Premise 2 does not follow deductively from 1 . What would be needed for the argu-ment argu-ment to regain respectability is a further premise to the extent, roughly, that objective moral truth (or perhaps objective truth more generally) is necessarily decidable, that there can be no (moral) truth at which we have no method of arriving. But I see no reason why anyone should accept such a verificationist premise in general,71 and I see no reason why anyone should accept it about morality unless they are already prepared - for independent reasons, presumably - to reject metaethical realism.72

What is meant, then, by the claim that there is no method to decide cases of moral disagreement? It seems to me four different thoughts may be - and often are - expressed by such claims. The point may be, first, that we just have no method of proceeding in cases of moral disagreement, that facing disagreement we are, as it were, at a loss for words, knowing not what we can possibly say or do next; or second, that though we do proceed in any number of ways, none of them is justified; or third, that there is no method that is guaranteed to lead to agreement, to make at least one party to the debate see her or his error; or fourth, that there is no method of settling the disagreement that is itself accepted as the proper method by all parties to the original disagreement.

Certainly, the absence of a method guaranteed to eliminate disagreement does not deductively entail the denial of realism. To do that we would need to add another premise, to the effect that though they may be morally mis-taken, mis-taken, people cannot be too mistaken, they cannot be such as to resist the moral truth when presented to them via a justified method. But I see no reason to accept this further premise, at least not unless one is already committed to the denial of realism. Neither is the absence of guaranteed dialectical success best explained by the denial of realism. The morally mistaken may be unconvinced by justified methods for any number of reasons - they may be too stupid, or may have epistemological beliefs (about which methods justify which beliefs) that are too crazy, or may not be willing to listen open-mindedly, or may again be subject to the distorting effects of interests - all of which perfectly compatible with realism.

78 Some Creationists, for instance, do not accept the scientific method. Of course, they are not often thought of as physicists. But utilizing this fact to save the purported disanalogy between physics and morality here would be cheating. One can always guarantee agreement on method by restricting the group of those who count (physicists, say) to just those who already agree on the relevant method. For an attempt to defend the analogy between disagreement in ethics and in the natural sciences (partly) by noting this point, see Sturgeon (2006, p. 108).

83 Many of the metaethical issues generalize straightforwardly to metanormative ones. If this is also true of the argument from rationally irresolvable disagreement (and it seems to me to be so), and seeing that the argument's premise is a normative claim (about what it is rationally permissible to believe), then this argument if sound entails also an antirealist view about its own premise. Depending on the details of the relevant antirealist view, this may cause a problem in the vicinity of self-defeat. But I cannot discuss this point further here.

96 Here is a closely related point: It is sometimes said in an attempt to capture the idea of a no-fault disagreement that moral disagreement survives the elimination of all mistakes of reasoning and all false non-moral non-moral beliefs. But this way of understanding what "no-fault" comes to begs the question against the realist. For what reason (that does not already presuppose the denial of realism) is there to distinguish between moral and non-moral false beliefs? If not being rationally at fault requires elimination of mistaken beliefs, it also requires - unless we already reject metaethical realism - the elimination of mistaken moral beliefs, and then it seems clear that there can be no no-fault moral disagreement. And if we decide not to take moral mistakes as establishing a rational fault, then perhaps no-fault moral disagreements are possible, but why believe that this shows anything about metaethical realism? Perhaps, for instance, scientific disagreement can survive the elimination of all non-scientific mistakes, but surely this does not support the rejection of scientific realism. Lillehammer (2004, p. 99), for instance, counts reliability on both sides among the necessary conditions for no-fault disagreement, but does not notice that this raises the problem discussed in this footnote in an especially troubling way.

Think of self-evidence again: Self-evidence can be thought of as the beginning of a moral epistemology that (among other things) explains the correlation between our moral beliefs and the moral truths. But -as can be seen from Sect. 3 above - it is hard to reconcile a moral epistemology grounded in self-evidence with facts about moral disagreement. And this is an example of how moral disagreement can be relevant to the epistemological challenge: It counts rather heavily against one attempt at addressing it (in terms of self-evidence). Disagreement can thus make matters harder for the realist, not because disagreement itself grounds an argument against realism, but because disagreement sets adequacy constraints on ways of addressing the general epistemological challenge to realism. This, it seems to me, is the most interesting role moral disagreement may have as a part of an objection to realism.108 And seeing that I will not here suggest a realist response to the epistemological challenge,

I leave it to antirealists to present better versions of arguments from disagreement.109 Let me conclude by emphasizing a fact that will make this an exceedingly hard task. Disagreement is widespread not just in morality, but also about morality, in metaethics, and indeed in philosophy in general.110 Here too, one comes across widespread dis-agreement among those who do not appear to be guilty of anything worth calling a cognitive shortcoming, here too this disagreement seems to call for explanation, here too it is not clear that there is some underlying agreement, say about the method to settle superficial disagreements. But this means that it is not going to be easy to present an argument from moral disagreement that does not defeat itself.111 If, for instance, the argument takes actual disagreement as a reason to be suspicious of realism, then given actual disagreement about metaethical realism and indeed about arguments from dis-agreement (this one included), the proponent of the argument seems to be committing 109 Notice that the discussion above - if successful - also casts doubt on the availability of antirealist arguments that are based on combining the effect of more than one of the arguments from disagreement. 110 Dworkin (1996, p. 1 14) argues that there is more disagreement in philosophy than in morality. 111 For a somewhat similar point see Swinburne (1976). Shafer-Landau (2003, p. 220; 2006, pp. 218-221) notices that arguments from disagreement can be applied in philosophy in general, and in metaethics in particular, so that there is something self-defeating about the antirealist' s employment of this argument from disagreement. But Shafer-Landau does not notice that this may render the arguments from disagreement themselves self-defeating in the way described in the text. Tersman (2006, p. 112) notices that a key premise in his favorite argument from disagreement - the one he calls "the latitude idea" - applies to much in philosophy as well as to ethics. But he does not proceed to discuss the self-defeat worry this fact may give rise to. £} Springer himself also to a denial of realism about the realism debate in metaethics and so about his very argument.

            <Title>Frankena, Naturalistic Fallacy</Title>
            <Text>Frankena, “The Naturalistic Fallacy”
Overview:
Frankena aims to discuss just what the Naturalistic Fallacy might be. According to him, the “definist” fallacy — defining two things as one thing (regardless of whether one of them is an ethical property and the other a natural property) — is closer to Moore’s argument. So “yellowness is pleasantness” is just as much an error of defining two distinct things as one thing as affirming “goodness is pleasantness.” The real error of definists, according to intuitionists, is that they don’t see the unique undefinable property of goodness. The real error of intuitionists, according to definists, is that they hallucinate a unique undefinable property of goodness. Unless and until we can correct this error we should leave off accusing people of “fallacies” that are not really logical. 
Synopsis:

●	The naturalistic fallacy in the premise (b) (on 469) that “What is sought by all men is good (by definition).” is the identification of goodness with ‘being sought by all men’ 
●	To identify good with even some metaphysical property ‘being equal’ or something, would be the naturalistic fallacy, according to Moore. 
●	The naturalistic fallacy is not a logical fallacy, since it can feature in valid arguments (468)
●	Consider the syllogism (a) Pleasure is sought by all men.  (b) What is sought by all men is good (by definition). (c) Therefore, pleasure is good. Moore denies that (b) is an ethical proposition — it is just a definition. The only reason this is an error is if we already know that goodness cannot be defined — something Moore asserts but does not argue except by begging the question. 
●	The real error behind the so-called naturalistic fallacy is what Frankena calls “the definist” fallacy, “the process of confusing or identifying two properites, of defining one property by another” (471). This error is independent of any process of defining ethical concepts in terms of non-ethical concepts. Those who argue that goodness just is pleasantness are arguing that the two properties are identical. To charge them with a fallacy is simply to beg the question, to assert that they are wrong without consideration. 
●	Is goodness definable? If any term is indefinable, then any attempt to define it will err. But if it is definable, then some definitions will be correct. “It is begging the question in favour of intuitionism to say in advance that the quality of goodness is indefinable and that, therefore, all naturalists commit the definist fallacy. One most know that goodness is indefinable before one can argue that the definist fallacy is a fallacy” (473). 
●	The real dispute, then, between intuitionists and definists (whether naturalistic or metaphysical) is whether propositions like “the desired is the good” are analytic (tautologous, true by definition, etc.) or synthetic. Intuitionists claim “at least a dim awareness of a simple unique quality or relation of goodness...” and definists “claim to have no awareness of any such quality” (474). This dispute cannot be resolved by allegations of fallacy.
●	The real error of definists is, if anything, “a kind of blindness, analogous to color-blindness” and the real error of intuitionists is “a corresponding moral hallucination... verbalism, hypostatisation” (475). 
●	The real method of resolving this disputes, then, is “the basic problem of contemporary philosophy, but no generally satisfactory solution of the problem has yet been reached” (477). 
Reflections:
This is an excellent piece. He teases out Moore’s real complaint with metaphysical and physical (including psychological) definitions of the good. Moore presumes the good to be unique and undefinable, then reproaches those who define it either by reference to being (Plato) or human happiness (Mill). The problem is not (1) using non-ethical premises to support ethical conclusions, nor (2) making analytic definitions of an ethical term by non-ethical terms, but defining the ethical term at all. If it is undefinable, then surely the philosopher attempting to define it will always go awry. But is it undefinable? His argument proves too much, that yellow is undefinable too. The problem is confusing ethical and non-ethical terms or treating them as the same. But the dispute is between those who avow to see an undefinable, intuitable property, and those avow not to see it. So one side accuses the other of moral blindness; the other side accuses the one of moral hallucination. While this dispute may be tractable, and may be very real and important, it is not a dispute over a “fallacy.”

It is fashionable now a days to deny the ‘is-ought’ distinction altogether. Hilary Putnam wrote a book on the collapse of the fact/value distinction. He has worked his way into a much more theistic position.

            <Title>After MacIntyre</Title>
            <Text>
The most fundamental thesis of *After Virtue's* many important claims is that teleology is natural to human practice. Human life is composed of end-directed practices. Human practices are composed of intelligible end-directed actions. So human life is thoroughly teleological. Even absent Aristotle's metaphysical biology of final causation, MacIntyre argues, human practice is and can be demonstrably shown to be teleological through reflection upon the phenomenology of action. 
Charles Taylor agrees:
&gt;MacIntyre shows how the growing sense among many different schools of modern philosophy that no 'ought' canb e derived from an 'is' is not the slow dawning of a context-free logical truth, but rather the correlate of the decline or rejection of the conception central to much ancient philosophy that human life was defined by a telos.[@taylor 16]
For the ancients, the human telos was defined by human nature. To us, such a definition may sound odd. For us, nature does not define *any* teloi. If, however, part of a thing's nature is its formal and final properties, then by definition part of our human nature is our formal properties (perhaps our capacity for rationality, language use, concept use, practical rationality, society, etc.) and our final properties (our search for the good, for happiness, for full self-actualization, or what have you). 
Stanley Hauerwas puts a similar point this way: that intelligible action is a more primary notion than action. The category of "action" simpliciter -- whether intelligible or not -- is not a basic, value-free category which subdivides into "action-&gt;intelligible" and "action-&gt;unintelligible." Rather, an intelligible action is the basic, value-laden category. An action *aims* for something; to aim at a target entails at least the conceptual possibility of not hitting the target. The very concept of an intelligible action -- e.g., planting a seed, petting a dog, greeting a friend, opening a bottle, dancing at a wedding, writing a lecture, -- is that of an agent acting *for a purpose* or to achieve an end. And our normal human life is made up of intelligible actions. 
The immediate objection that springs to mind upon hearing the suggestion that teleology is "natural" is the belief that nature is telos-free. And, it is thought, that belief is justified by modern science or is most consonant with other beliefs justifed by modern science. To borrow a bit from scriptural theologian Rudolf Bultmann, perhaps "it is impossible to use electrical light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in [Aristotle's world of final causes and natural purposes].”[@bultmann1961kerygma 5] 

Suppose that modernity is a moral disaster. 

MacIntyre explains the present disastrous state of things through the modern rejection of telos. Teleological nihilism as we might call the view that there are no real, natural teloi. There may be teloi but they are all features of us, not features of the external world. They may be psychological projections upon the world that appear incorrigibly to be features of the real, natural world. But reflection can, somehow, expose this appearance as illusion. 

The recovery of telos, Taylor points out, may be undertaken in one of two ways. Both ways fundamentally agree with MacIntyre’s diagnosis of modernity and agree with the prognosis that we must recovery our belief — acknowledgment of — teloi. But the tension between the two ways represents and important crux upon which even MacIntyre’s sympathizers must align themselves. 

The first way of recovering telos is to identify those tenets of teleological nihilism explicit or implicit in characteristically modern doctrines and to reject both those tenets and the doctrines with which they are intertwined. This is an amputation surgery. The doctrine is infected by teleological nihilism and must be removed. 

The second way of recovering telos is to chart those tenets of teleological nihilism explicit or implicit in characteristically modern doctrines and reject the teleological nihilism but retain, in modified form certainly, but retain improved versions of the doctrines in which they were formerly intertwined. This is a tumorectomy. The doctrine is infected by teleological nihilism may be saved, even cured, by the removal of the offending tenet (followed by whatever curative or restorative work might be needed).

Let’s look at an example. 

One doctrine of modernity is the idealization and glorification of “disengaged freedom.” According to Taylor, the concept of freedom assumed in modernity is that of procedural rationality. Rationality is not a substantial concept defined by say, the acknowledgement of an external world or the belief that I am a human being rather than an archangel. Similarly, ethics is procedural, not substantive. The Kantian ethic of rule-following is abstract, rational, universal, and identical for each rational agent. The same rule followed by different agents is supposed to produce the same end. In this way, the freedom of moral agency is identical with obedience to moral rules. The Aristotelian conception of ethics is more substantive — practical rationality must embrace some goods before and during procedural analysis or means-end instrumental reasoning. 
This view of the substantive good of freedom seems… good. At least to moderns. Can this view of the substantive good of freedom be saved? Or is it a casualty of a restoration of Aristotelian tradition?

            <Title>Dissertation Proposal D3</Title>
            <Text>Here's the pitch: 
In the last 60 years in analytic philosophy, virtue ethics has achieved a kind of ascendancy. According to the Chalmers survey, 18% (almost a fifth) of analytic philosophers are virtue ethicists (with only 25% and 23% avowing deontology or consequentialism, the rest declined those categories). But what exact doctrines "virtue ethics" is supposed to entail is far from clear. Worse, the foundations of virtue ethics are still largely unexplored. Second order metaethical debates pretend to neutrality with respect to first-order normative ethical theories like consequentialism or virtue ethics.  

And yet, one's conclusions about metaethical foundations do bear natural relations to specific ethical theories. Moore's Principia, a metaethical source text, is consequentialist, and many naturalist realists (like Boyd and Railton) and even non-cognitivists (like Mackie) are consequentialists. Non-naturalists tend to be realists (like Shaffer-Lanau) and divine command theorists (like Robert Adams) or deontologists (like Kant, who is a non-naturalist with respect to ethics if not metaphysics). 

So how might the core commitments of virtue ethics affect one's conclusion about metaethical foundations? The virtue ethicist is committed, minimally, to virtue talk, to the conceptual definition of virtue as somehow beneficial (Hursthouse). Also, she is committed to notions of practical wisdom (Annas). Although some are not eudaimonists (Stephen Brown), traditional virtue ethics is committed to the notion that happiness is the telos of human life or at least that human life has a telos (MacIntyre). 
 
Debates between moral realism and anti-realism (whether any "values" are real), objectivism or subjectivism (whether real values are "stance-independent"), naturalism and non-naturalism (whether moral facts are natural facts), as well as moral motivation (whether moral considerations are necessarily motivating), moral epistemology (whether and how we know moral truth) -- all need to be given a treatment from the assumption that (a plausible version of) the core commitments of virtue ethics are true.

It would be impossible or perhaps foolhardy for me to attempt a full treatment. Instead, I work toward this end by examining six influential virtue ethicists to discover their positions (if any) on these metaethical debates, and the strengths and weaknesses of their metaethical positions. Those six virtue ethicists are: Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, John McDowell, Stephen Brown, and Robert Adams. First, I briefly review the virtue theory of Aristotle and the historical ascendancy of the Aristotelian virtue tradition in the English-speaking philosophy (via Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, and others). 

Secondly, I give a chapter to each thinker, respecting their own metaethical concerns but also attempting to build toward a coherent foundation of virtue. 

First, I examine Alasdair MacIntyre especially his critique of expressivism and his notion that telos is the heart and soul of the Aristotelian ethical tradition.Second, I examine Foot's language-centered theory of "goodness" and her critique of Moore's assumption that ethics is all about the predicate "good." Third, I examine Rosalind Hursthouse's appropriation of (and differences from) Foot, and her account of moral objectivity and moral naturalism.  Fourth, I examine John McDowell's philosophical anthropology of "second nature" in the context of his "liberal naturalism", especially his unique brand of idealism or inter-subjectivism as it pertains to practical reason. Fifth, I examine Stephen Brown's reductive, Darwinian virtue ethics, especially his rejection of eudaemonia, his solution to the "is/ought" gap, and his argument that reproduction is the function of humanity. Sixth, I examine Robert Adams supernaturalistic, theistic virtue ethics, especially his avowal of divine command theory, his notion of "excellence", and how the unity and transcendence of the good informs his metaethical theory.

In the third section, I present my own contribution. I synthesize what I take to be what is correct in each of these thinkers and reject what I take to be faulty or implausible, building (or beginning) an account that constitutes a metaethical foundation of virtue.  This synthesis shows that seemingly disparate notions actually gather themselves into two coherent and competing accounts. Both of which are non-reductive, morally realist accounts, but differ especially with respect to the metaphysical status of nature, God, and human nature. Finally, I articulate the theoretical costs and benefits of each in light of the broader debate between theism and metaphysical naturalism.

            <Title>## Chapter Outline</Title>
            <Text>### CHAPTER 2: ALASDAIR MACINTYRE

Chapter 2 will be a summary and discussion of the ethical thought of Alasdair MacIntyre, especially what is called his “*After Virtue* Project”.[@macintyre1984after, *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988), *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990), *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999)] The "*After Virtue* Project" invites readers to give up on modern rationalistic moralities and return to the (still living) Aristotelian tradition of virtues. 

MacIntyre is highly influential but difficult to categorize. He declines the title "virtue ethicist" but has strongly affected virtue ethics. I shall examine his definition of virtue as acquire traits that sustain traditions, enable success in "practices," and solidify communities. I shall summarize the idiosyncratic angle from which MacIntyre approaches ethics due to his extreme criticism of modernity and modern moral philosophy. How does telos, the narrative unity of the self, and tradition-constituted rationality support or imperil his conception of virtue? Can his "social teleology" model of virtue survive the objection that human beings have no inherent, natural telos? 

In critically appraising MacIntyre’s account, I will take seriously several of the objections that have arisen in MacIntyrean scholarship.[@horton1994after] For example, many have disputed his pessimistic diagnosis of modern moral philosophy; others have disputed the (alleged) relativism of his historicist solution; others have accused him of inappropriate nostalgia for the past; while others have challenged his notion of tradition. I shall attempt to respond to these objections and to find some lessons of value after the dust settles. 

### CHAPTER 3: PHILIPPA FOOT

Chapter 3 will be a summary and discussion of Philippa Foot's *Virtues and Vices*[@foot2002virtues] and *Natural Goodness*[@foot2001natural], which has been praised as “among the most beautiful and moving works of moral philosophy yet produced in the analytic tradition.”[@thompson2007reconciling] Foot, like MacIntyre, is critical of Moore's axiomatic assumptions and the ethical theorizing built upon them.

Foot argues, following Geach, that virtues are those "beneficial" qualities without which "human beings do not get on well."[@foot2002virtues] Virtues benefit both the possessor and the others in society with whom the virtuous person lives. Virtues and vices "belong to the will"[@foot2002virtues] and so exclude even morally relevant features of one's personality (irascibility) or cognitive abilities (good memory) over which we have no control.  At the same time, the presence of practical wisdom (an intellectual more than moral trait) on the list of virtues challenges the notion that virtue and vice are *merely* moral. 

She defends this theory from metaethical objections by offering a “fresh start” beginning with moral language. She concedes that non-cognitivism better explains the “motivational gap” between normative facts and descriptive facts, which Brown says “might be the problem of ethics”[@brown2008 95]. But she argues that there is an alternate explanation of the “action-guiding character of morality” — that is, the very old but not very fashionable thesis that “acting morally is part of practical rationality."[@foot2001natural 9, and also @foot1994rationality]

She also discovers (what she argues is) an identical match in logical structure between evaluations of plants, animals, etc., and evaluations of humans.[@foot2001natural] Her account owes much to Peter Geach’s *On the Virtues*, which is also unabashedly teleological. Ethical evaluations of individual humans are grounded in what Michael Thompson calls ‘Aristotelian Categoricals’ or ‘Aristotelian Necessities’. Such categoricals denote a species’ life form and hence ground evaluations  of how well an individual plant or human lives up to its lifeform.[@thompson2008life, 1] For Foot, virtues are straightforwardly descriptive/normative qualities that exemplary human beings exhibit. Vices disable living creatures from exemplifying their lifeform well; a deer that cannot leap or a wolf that does not hunt in packs is vicious. There is an essential parity between non-human and human virtues and vices. 

If space permits, this chapter will also engage with Foot’s exploration of happiness as “deep” satisfaction. She gives weight to the intuitive belief that a virtuous person can become miserable through life circumstances and ill luck. So she thinks virtues are not constitutive of happiness. Also, I shall examine her response (on the basis of natural goodness) to immoralism. In critically appraising Foot’s account, I shall engage literature from @annas1993morality, Michael Thompson, @mcdowell1998mindvalue, @marinus and others who have clarified and either attacked or defended her novel views.

### CHAPTER 4: JOHN MCDOWELL

Chapter 4 will explore and analyze the philosophical ethics of John McDowell.[@mcdowell1988values] It will explore his own brand of idealism with regard to reason and practical reason[@mcdowell1979virtue] and his understanding of the relation between virtue and happiness.[@mcdowell1980role] 

McDowell critiques "empirical naturalism", or the view that normative ethical conclusions can be derived from value-free observations from nature or biological.  (This is a response to one interpretation of Foot.) Along with his critique of transcendent or supernatural ethics, he carves out a *via media* some have called “excellence naturalism.” McDowell's account of virtue has moral and intellectual excellences as part of “second nature."[@mcdowell1996mind] Practical reason (sensitive to reasons, the ability act for a reason at all rather than merely because of desire or instinct) is "natural" for humans but not in the same sense that eating and drinking and sleeping are natural. Sensitivity to reasons, and the ability to act on those reasons, is natural via second nature. Second nature is not reducible to the realm of law that defines the rest of nature. Hence, ethical conclusions are ultimately not grounded in nature or in God’s will. They are grounded in a kind of Neurathian procedure of reflection on virtuous agents, reflection on our own lives, and self-constituted goals we undertake. 

Interestingly, this position has been classified by turns as "neo-Aristotelian naturalism"[@annas2005virtue] as well as "neo-Kantian non-naturalism."[@rehg2003conceptual] So I shall engage with some of the growing secondary literature on McDowell.[@mcdowell2008critics] 

### CHAPTER 5: ROSALIND HURSTHOUSE

Chapter 5 will explore and analyze Hursthouse’s powerful and influential *On Virtue Ethics*.[@hursthouse1998] Hursthouse approaches the difficulties of defending virtue ethics with panache and wit. Her account of virtue argues that virtues benefit their possessor. What does this mean? I shall discuss her account of  “phronesis, or practical wisdom, which is the ability to reason correctly about practical matters.”[@hursthouse2006practical, 12]

I shall pay special attention to her account of the telos of humanity (as four characteristic ends) and the nature of humanity. For Hursthouse, as for Foot, human beings qua life-form have a nature. Human nature grounds ethical evaluations.  The Latinate term ‘virtue’ is a normative term for man in that it implies that a human can be fully human or lack humanity; one can reach full humanity or become inhumane.  

On objectivity, Hursthouse largely follows McDowell but extends his account by defending her own notion of the “objectivity” of ethical evaluations. For Hursthouse, the question whether morality has “objectivity” reduces to two distinct questions: (1) can morality be justified from outside, from a neutral, third-person, scientific point of view? On the first question, Hursthouse is surprisingly quick. No, morality cannot be justified from “outside”. But, she affirms, an inability to justify morality from the outside is not such a big problem as some have made it out to be. And (2), can we solve the problem of moral disagreement — can we save the normativity of morality from the debunking and deflationary accounts that point to moral disagreement to disprove putative morality’s objectivity?  It is the second question she devotes virtually the whole chapter to.  Her discussion holds an important place in the debate between moral constructivism and stance-indepenent realism — which provides the strongest foundation for virtue ethics?  

### CHAPTER 6: ROBERT ADAMS

Chapter 6 will explore and analyze the philosophical ethics of Robert Adams.[@adams2006] Though he credits much influence to Anscombe and MacIntyre, my other key authors are more identifiably Aristotelian. Like the others, he aims to discuss the ethics of character rather than (merely) the ethics of action. He is also avowedly theistic in his metaethics, defending a virtue theory within a framework of a divine command theory.[@adams2002finite] 

I shall summarize his account of virtue "as excellence in being for the good,"" and his account of the good, his defense of the unity of virtues, and his responses to the charge that virtue is egoistic or non-altruistic. I shall also critically engage with literature responding to Adams, such as the responses of Richard Boyd,[@boyd2003finite] and the literature to which Adams is responding, such as Thomas Hurka.[@hurka2003virtue]

### CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSIONS

Chapter 7 will survey the terrain covered. What themes recur, and what arguments seem to stand up under scrutiny? If the labor of these chapters produces fruit, it will draw out points of value from the contributions of each of these influential authors. The concluding chapter, then, will take stock of those contributions and explore the possibility of developing a more exact and more plausible account of virtue. Which of these writers’ contributions can be combined? Which are incompatible? What future directions do these conclusions point to? I intend to close with reflections upon methodology in ethical inquiry. </Text>

            <Title>The Radical Discontinuity Objection</Title>
            <Text>This chapter delves into some metaphysics of ethics. 

The belief that 'nature is it' and 'science studies nature' has arisen from heresy to orthodoxy. 
The objection from naturalists about morality or practical reasons is that they are not 'natural.' They are not real. 
They are weird, queer, strange, sui generis, unprecedented, unexplainable, mysterious, obscure, opaque, supernatural, preternatural, and (of course) unnatural. 

But what else is weird like norms? 

1. Modal facts
2. Intentional facts -- I am thinking *about* Hawaii
3. Mathematical facts
5. Logical facts

##Examples of the radical discontinuity objection

"There is a common feeling, at least among naturalists, that explaining ethics only in terms of one kind of 'stuff' -- namely, natural stuff -- is a desirable thing, if it can be done" (Brown 2004, 7). 

"A fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature" (Brown 2004, 4). 


#Chapter X -  Naturalizing Virtue 1 - Philippa Foot’s Biologism, Stephen R. Brown’s Darwinism 

	[In the last chapters, we have set out the criteria by which a robust and satisfying metaethical theory can explain what is most puzzling about our lives as practical reasoning creatures, and we sketched — albeit quickly — the skeleton of such a metaethical theory. That sketch invoked not only thin evaluative contrasts like ‘good/bad’, and ‘right/wrong’ but also thick ones like ‘courageous/cowardly’ and ‘happy/miserable.’ That sketch gave especial weight to the notion of human nature and tried to specify the distinctly human goods belonging to us by nature. Those goods we called person, interpersonal, and communal. They included individual flourishing of mind and will in intellectual and moral virtues, but the joys of friendship, camaraderie, and the joy of romantic love, including but not limited to reproduction, and social flourishing within family and polity or community that functions with harmony and justice. All of these, or something like them, rather than simply genetic proliferation, seem to us to be the human race, if anything is.
	
	Three sorts of responses are likely: 
	
* “That all sounds about right. But much more needs to be said to clarify, disambiguate, and substantiate these claims.

* “That doesn’t sound right. I have a substantive objection to one or more claims in your sketch.”

* “That all sounds about right. But how do we naturalize it? How do we ensure that your sketch is consistent with naturalism per se?”
Responses 1 and 2 will have to wait until later chapters. This chapter, and the next few, will be about the project of naturalizing virtue theories of which my sketch in the last chapter is a token.]</Text>

            <Title>The Spirit of Naturalism</Title>
            <Text>
What is the underlying concern or commonality among naturalists from Lucretius to Dewey to Quine and McDowell? Provisionally, I take the underlying spirit of naturalism be what I call the continuity criterion.  This criterion says that all the sciences are unified in a harmonious set of methods and practices and aims, and that nature is a unified manifold of substances and properties. The continuity criterion (which assumes scientific realism as opposed to, say, transcendental idealism) aims to match all of our knowledge to all of reality. It is exclusive and inclusive. It excludes pseudoscience, superstition, mythology, or pessimism over insoluble “mysteries” but seeks to account for all of the continuous manifold of existence into a unified body of knowledge, a single science or harmonious set of sciences, like the many leaves of Sybil’s book.  
So, for instance, physicalism meets the continuity criterion. This continuity criterion can be satisfied by physicalism by eliminating everything that does not immediately appear on a list of physical objects or phenomena: not only gods and souls, but abstract objects, properties. 
The continuity criterion can be satisfied via pragmatism, or via the emergence of the non-physical from the physical and its supervenience. For this reason also evolutionary naturalists or emergent naturalists ground all the special features of humans in the organizational complexity of our biology: Chemicals and elements, at a level of complexity and organization, become living matter. Brains, at an appropriate level of complexity and organization or structure, become conscious matter — still more complex and organized, self-conscious matter. And at that moment, nature has an "inside." </Text>

            <Title>Sinclair, Neil, Two kinds of naturalism</Title>
            <Text>Neil Sinclair, “Two Kinds of Naturalism in Ethics”
Ethical Theory and Moral Practice 9:417-439, 2006. 
Overview:
Sinclair argues that one sort of naturalistic ethics demands that moral properties playing a role in good empirical theories (on par with the natural and social sciences) — but neither Railton nor McDowell satisfy this condition. A second sort of naturalistic ethics doesn’t so demand. And this one is true. On realism and naturalism, all that moral properties need explain is the truth or falsehood of some agent’s moral beliefs. 
Synopsis:
Some naturalist ethicists demand that moral properties can only be naturalised if “moral properties feature in good explanations of certain observable non-moral events” (417). But if we do not demand this we can still be naturalists, and still wonder whether “moral factors feature in explanations of agents’ material success, or processes of social change, but the answer to this question will not affect one’s position on the nature of moral properties” (418). 

A defining property must explain the intuitive force of the term (so for morality that means explain the inherent to-be-done-ness of moral concepts) and be naturalistic (so for morality, according to Railton, that means that the moral “facts contribute to the a posteriori explanation of certain features of our experience”(421)). And Railton thinks that to be naturalistically respectable his definitions must satisfy both. Sinclair argues that Railton does not satisfy the latter. 

Railton thinks moral norms are interpersonal and impartial — they “reflect a certain kind of rationality, rationality not from the point of view of any particular individual, but from what might be called a social point of view” (422). This social point of view of “instrumentally rational agents” approve those PHIs that are in the interests of “all potentially affected individuals counted equally under conditions of full and vivid information” (423). Thus moral rightness is response dependent; it depends on the response of ideally instrumentally rational people. What is the property itself? It must be dispositional. It is identical to ‘being disposed to elicit approval from ideal people, etc.’ 

The property does explanatory work when we explain, say, social instability, by positing that the institutional arrangements are wrong (427). The problem is that by wrongness we mean that some ideally rational agents actually obtain in the society and (because of their ideally rational reflection) disapprove of the social institutions. Or, if those people don’t obtain, then (implausibly) the idealised counterfactual situation that ideal agents would disapprove if they existed somehow does causal work.

Suppose the “ground” of the dispositional property (liable to cause disapproval) is the “significant discounting of the interests of a particular group” (431). Then that discounting would cause the disapproval and explain the unrest, but now it (and not wrongness) is doing the explanatory work. The property of discounting the interests of others is not identical to the property of wrongness, so it cannot be a common property to all categorial grounds of dispositional properties (there are some kinds of discounting others’ interests that are not wrong). 

Sinclair proposes that such considerations apply to “any naturalist who hopes to account for moral properties in dispositional terms and who accepts the condition on naturalistic respectability imposed by the first kind of naturalism in ethics” (435). The dilemma is this: 

1.	If moral properties are dispositional properties, they are not very explanatory (can’t feature in “good empirical theories”), because the ideal conditions (or infrequently actualized conditions) in which an ideal observer properly reacts to them; but if moral properties are the categorical grounds of dispositional properties, then they are not very explanatory (can’t feature in”good empirical theories”) because there is no a priori guarantee that those grounds are explanatory. 
2.	Either moral properties are dispositional properties or the categorical grounds of dispositional properties. 
3.	So either way, moral properties cannot are not very explanatory (can’t feature in “good empirical theories”).  

So the naturalist can keep looking for an account of the property of moral wrongness that can figure in good empirical theories or else stop looking for an account that figures in good empirical theories (that is still somehow naturalistic). 

If our naturalistic epistemology limits our ontology, then we can only know p exists if p is part of an explanation for, say, a causal empirical theory (437). But Sinclair urges that what moral properties explain is not paradigmatic natural phenomena but people’s changes of moral beliefs. In other words, the natural phenomena that moral properties can explain are not agent-independent but the truth or falsehood or change in agent’s moral judgments. Actual people can more closely satisfy the conditions of an ideal person (instrumentally rational) and thus change their moral beliefs to “successfully ‘track’ the responses of instrumentally rational people when in the relevant idealised situation” (438). 

Reflections:
To be naturalistic, according to Sinclair, the values under examination must be empirically verifiable. That is, our ontology should be limited by our epistemic access to the properties in question; we should only believe what is real is what is useful or explanatory in explaining phenomena. Railton thinks they must feature in plausible explanations of non-moral facts, but Sinclair argues against this. 

This article may be useful in arguing against one move in the ethical naturalist’s argument — namely, arguing that moral properties are like other (natural) properties in that they can and should be known empirically and used in empirical explanations. I’m not sure what to make of Sinclair’s “second kind of naturalism.”

            <Title>After MacIntyre - Taylor, Charles, Justice After Virtue</Title>
            <Text>Suppose that modernity is a moral disaster. 
MacIntyre explains the present disastrous state of things through the modern rejection of telos. Teleological nihilism as we might call the view that there are no real, natural teloi. There may be teloi but they are all features of us, not features of the external world. They may be psychological projections upon the world that appear incorrigibly to be features of the real, natural world. But reflection can, somehow, expose this appearance as illusion. 
The recovery of telos, Taylor points out, may be undertaken in one of two ways. Both ways fundamentally agree with MacIntyre’s diagnosis of modernity and agree with the prognosis that we must recovery our belief — acknowledgment of — teloi. But the tension between the two ways represents and important crux upon which even MacIntyre’s sympathizers must align themselves. 
The first way of recovering telos is to identify those tenets of teleological nihilism explicit or implicit in characteristically modern doctrines and to reject both those tenets and the doctrines with which they are intertwined. This is an amputation surgery. The doctrine is infected by teleological nihilism and must be removed. 
The second way of recovering telos is to chart those tenets of teleological nihilism explicit or implicit in characteristically modern doctrines and reject the teleological nihilism but retain, in modified form certainly, but retain improved versions of the doctrines in which they were formerly intertwined. This is a tumorectomy. The doctrine is infected by teleological nihilism may be saved, even cured, by the removal of the offending tenet (followed by whatever curative or restorative work might be needed).
Let’s look at an example. 
One doctrine of modernity is the idealization and glorification of “disengaged freedom.” According to Taylor, the concept of freedom assumed in modernity is that of procedural rationality. Rationality is not a substantial concept defined by say, the acknowledgement of an external world or the belief that I am a human being rather than an archangel. Similarly, ethics is procedural, not substantive. The Kantian ethic of rule-following is abstract, rational, universal, and identical for each rational agent. The same rule followed by different agents is supposed to produce the same end. In this way, the freedom of moral agency is identical with obedience to moral rules. The Aristotelian conception of ethics is more substantive — practical rationality must embrace some goods before and during procedural analysis or means-end instrumental reasoning. 
This view of the substantive good of freedom seems… good. At least to moderns. Can this view of the substantive good of freedom be saved? Or is it a casualty of a restoration of Aristotelian tradition?

            <Text>	1.	## Chapter Introduction ##
	2.	In this chapter, we turn our attention to Philippa Foot. Philippa Foot is a widely celebrated and idiosyncratic author. Her writings have been influential but often misunderstood. She does not — and proudly does not — conform to some of the pervasive expectations on analytic philosophers (and especially ethicists). This non-conformity both frees her from common prejudices and subjects her to uncommon misunderstandings.

Her main thesis in “natural goodness” is similarly teleological: ‘goodness’ is a functional concept and applies (at least) to all *living natural* entities. “Natural goodness” for her does not refer to “natural law.”[@foot2001natural chapter 1] Foot’s contribution to an adequate foundation of virtue will be to render this account more plausible and to extend it by insightful reflection on moral language. Foot’s Natural Goodness (among other) also affords us an opportunity to revisit the assumptions of G.E. Moore and the Principia Ethica, criticizing them from a different angle than MacIntyre. 
	4.	In the last chapter, we saw that teleology — at least social teleology —  is essential to ethics. Teleology is also a best “fit” for virtue ethics rather than modern rationalistic Kantian and utilitarian theories that make *duties themselves* or the external, contingent *consequences of actions* play the definitive role. Teleology may or may not be “natural” more broadly (inherent to the cosmos as a whole or inherent to all living things) but it is intrinsic to *human practices*. And, human practices, are *human*. We are practical creatures by nature. We’ve called this practicality and the claim that such practicality is end-directed or teleological “social teleology.”

Original introduction

##Introduction
	Most philosophers believe that at least some of our ethical beliefs are really true and that some things are really good. But if the good is real, is it natural or nonnatural? Richard Boyd argues that our term ‘goodness’ refers to a set of natural “immanent” mutually reinforcing properties that favor human well-being. Robert Adams argues that the good is identical to a supernatural, transcendent God. Good things are such just insofar as they resemble God. Which metaethical position makes the best sense of our (sometimes correct, sometimes incorrect) application of ethical terms in everyday discourse and the historic discipline of systematic ethics? 

	These questions embroil us in metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, and semantic considerations. Of course, a full treatment of them here is not possible. As Boyd points out, metaphysical commitments to or against the existence of a god will sway one’s ethical commitments. Rather, in this paper,</Notes>

            <Title>Copp, David, Why Naturalism?</Title>
            <Text>David Copp, “Why Naturalism?”
Ethical Theory and Moral Practice, Vol. 6, No. 2 Papers Presented to the Annual Conference of the British Society for Ethical Theory, April 2002 pp. 179-200
Overview:
Copp argues that naturalism ought to be the notion that moral properties are empirical — that there is no synthetic proposition about a moral property that does not admit of empirical evidence against it. As he says, the crux of the matter is “whether any synthetic proposition about the instantiation of a moral property is “strongly a priori” in that it does not admit of empirical evidence against it” (Abstract). His definition of “strongly a priori” is that of a proposition that can be reasonably believed without empirical evidence and that cannot be refuted by empirical evidence (including testimony).  As he says “no proposition is such that both, it can be reasonably believed without empirical evidence, and it admits no empirical evidence against it” (192). 
Synopsis:
Introduction
1.	Copp’s goal is not to say that naturalism is true, nor to defend it against familiar objections (179). He wants to motivate naturalism. 
2.	An ethical naturalist “holds that there are moral properties... rightness, goodness... and... that these properties...are ‘natural’ (179). 
3.	Ethical naturalism is distinct from ‘unrestricted naturalism’ — naturalism about mathematics. One can be one or the other without being both. He takes ethical naturalism as a species of moral realism.
Moore
4.	Moore’s characterisation of naturalism is that “ethics is an empirical or positive science: its conclusions could all be established by means of empirical observation and induction” (181); Copp thinks analytic moral truths known a priori might be part of ethical naturalism — so we ought to say synthetic moral truths must be empirical; and that knowledge of the instantiation of moral properties must be empirical. 
Contemporary Conceptions of Natural Properties
5.	There are four approaches to defining nature: (A) reductionism (B) ostensive definitions (C) metaphysical definitions (D) epistemic definitions (182)
a.	Reductionism looks for subvenient properties that relate to moral properties. But even non-naturalists can grant that moral properties supervene on the non-moral; and reductionism does not tell us what is ‘natural’ about the natural property.
b.	Ostensive definitions (like Frank Jackson’s) point to familiar exemplars of natural objects, tables, mountains, etc. and define ‘natural properties’ as those ‘needed to give a complete account of things like them” (183, quoting Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics, p.7). But a non-naturalist can “insist that moral properties” need be included in a complete account.
c.	Metaphysical definitions define natural properties in metaphysical terms, either as:
i.	“descriptive” or “factual” properties. But we predicate “goodness” and “compassion” of people both descriptively and factually. 
ii.	the causal order. But it cannot be assumed the the natural order is necessarily causal, since at the most fundamental level of physics there may be no causes; also, even theistic accounts of the universe include God as a part of the causal order, so this definition does not exclude supernatural causation..
iii.	as the ‘spatiotemporal manifold’, the “conjunction of all states of affairs in space and time” (184). But Platonistic properties are not in space-time.
iv.	as the material or physical world. But ethical naturalism need not be physicalistic/materialistic. 
d.	Epistemic definitions treat science as our “most reliable source of empirical knowledge” but also allow other kinds of empirical (but non-scientific) knowledge, like knowledge of street names, popular foods, and what not. 
6.	Copp explicates naturalism “in terms of the empirical” not necessarily that sub-set of the empirical that is the scientific. 
7.	Natural Properties as Empirical Properties
8.	There may be conceptual or analytic truths like “murder is wrong”, but there are no synthetic moral truths except those known a posteriori. 
The Synthetic A Priori
9.	“The naturalist’s thesis that all of our knowledge of synthetic moral truths is empirical commits the naturalist to denying the synthetic a priori in ethics. The naturalist is committed to rejecting the possibility of a priori knowledge of synthetic moral truths while the non-naturalist is committed to embracing this possibility. The non-naturalist is therefore allied with Moore and Kant while the naturalists are lined up on the other side. The pivotal issue is whether there can be synthetic a priori knowledge in ethics” (187).
10.	  There is a distinction between strongly a priori and weakly a priori — weakly a priori (borrowing terms from Hartry Field) means it can be reasonably believed without empirical evidence but is empirically defeasible — strongly a priori can be reasonably believed without empirical evidence and empirical evidence could not discount it. 
Ethical Naturalism and the Strongly A Priori
11.	“The underlying idea is that moral truths reflect empirical facts about human nature, the needs of societies, and the like” (191)

        <Document ID="741">
            <Title>## Notes 10/14/15</Title>
            <Text>We have seen MacIntyre’s argument that a-teleological ethics is purposeless ethics. We have seen that much of modern moral theorizing is such purposeless ethics — a set of abstract rules (supposed to satisfy the demands of universal duty) or a set of actions (supposed to be likely to cause the desired consequences) devoid of historical context and social content. And we have seen that the restoration of teleological virtues, in their social/traditional context, makes the whole *quest of life* intelligible, including the practical reason needed to live well and the moral virtues needed to avoid temptations to live poorly and to become fully human. These teleological virtues we grounded in human practice. 
We have seen with Foot that there may indeed be *biological* grounding for teleological virtue as well. As Aristotle observed, and as any present day observer can confirm for himself, there is a parity between the *the nature of living beings as they appear to us* and functional and semantic properties in our language (both words and grammar). If this is right, then the Great Platitudes that living virtuously is living a *fully human* life is vindicated. We are required by practical rationality, by our social nature, *and* by our biological nature to develop virtues like loyalty, promise-keeping, courage, and practical wisdom. Furthermore, we vindicated the presumption that a special sort of deep happiness (contrasted with pleasure) is the natural, intrinsic result of the excellence or perfection of our nature (social, psychological, biological, etc.). We contrasted Foot’s theory which McDowell critiqued as “empirical naturalism”  with Stephen Brown’s similar theory and argued that Brown more justly falls under that condemnation than Foot. 
The recurring theme of these explorations has been what the Great Platitudes say about human nature as creatures in the broader cosmos. We saw with John McDowell how the fear of “spooky” metaphysics compels some to sharply distinguish human nature from nature as a whole; to transpose human “second nature” or culture on the vast, interlocking matrix of space-time and energy that is the dominant image of Laplacian nature. But McDowell’s brand of neo-Kantian idealism promises more than it delivers. When pushed, the dichotomy between nature / human nature collapses under the pressure of the absolute or unrestricted conception of nature and a restricted conception. McDowell wants nature to be restricted, but the line restricting it leaves mysterious everything outside nature. When he wants it unrestricted, then he cannot exclude (except by definitional fiat!) the supernatural entities or properties he is spooked by. The upshot is that McDowell’s theorizing is vulnerable to being ransacked by an Aristotelian realist (like myself) who plunders the realism while discarding the physicalism, anti-realism, or idealism. McDowell’s objections to such a plundering can in-principle contain no adequate rejoinders.

            <Text>
###Richard Boyd I:  Homeostatic Property Clusters
First, a few words on Richard Boyd’s metaethical project are in order. Boyd’s “How to Be a Moral Realist” (1998) essay has been influential in establishing the viability of one kind of ethical naturalism. Boyd is not a non-cognitivist or “otherwise deflationary” naturalist. He is interested (along with Sturgeon, Brink, Miller, et. al.,) in justifying moral realism within the bounds of a strict, scientific naturalism. Their project has at least two claims:  ethics is a science (or should be!); ethical inquiry can and should be continuous with empirical scientific inquiries. That is the epistemological claim.  And ethics is consequentialist; Boyd and others think ethical inquiry will involve giving some kind of naturalistic account of our collective human welfare and of those natural properties that contribute thereto. That is the normative ethical claim. 

Most of Boyd’s writings have focused on the schema rather than the content of a naturalistic moral realism, offering a general framework rather than detailed and comprehensive moral realist accounts, including a list of goods. Even so, in sketching out the schema, he has offered an account of “important human goods”, both physical and psychological, like food and friendship. Exactly what natural entities and properties count as human goods will become important below. 

#### Natural Kinds
For Boyd, goods are importantly like natural kinds. Normal natural kinds, like ‘water’ and ‘metal’ indispensably feature in our inductive and abductive reasoning. I borrow the term and concept ‘abductive reasoning’ from C. S. Peirce. It is the method of hypothesis, “guessing,” or inference to the best explanation. Abduction takes the logical form of what is usually considered a deductive fallacy. A  -&gt; B. Therefore, (probably) A.  Abductive reasoning is explanation-making. For example, suppose that I begin typing on a friend’s laptop on a cold day, but I notice the keys are surprisingly cold to the touch. My friend points out that his keyboard keys are not plastic but metal. “Metal” of course, is not one single element on the periodic table, and so has no one single essence, understood as a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for instantiation. So what is such a natural kind? Certain properties tend to cluster together (conductivity, malleability, etc.), where the presence of each of which makes likely the presence of the others. This understanding of natural kinds is flexible enough to show why ‘metal’ can feature in a good explanation (of why the keyboard is cold) and also why exceptional or unusual metals —- ones that lack some typical properties — still count as members of the natural kind.

Biological natural kinds follow the same pattern. Tigers are real, and ‘tiger’ the natural kind is real. We do not invent, but discover, the nature of tigers.  Yet ‘Tiger’ is not one property-instantiation of a simple universal, but denotes a cluster of properties that tend to make likely others in that cluster.

Goodness, Boyd suggests, is just such a natural kind and homeostatic property cluster. Something similar to our application of terms like ‘metal’ and ‘tiger’ is going on in our application of value terms and the semantic relation to real — but natural —  value-properties. Our value talk  is answerable to something in the mind-independent real world: such property clusters. Property clusters like goodness, however, have no one analytic definition — at base, they are not unities but pluralities. Keeping goodness as a natural kind without supplying an analytic definition helpfully avoids the definist fallacy. In an old but excellent article, Frankena (1939) has persuaded me that Moore’s “naturalistic fallacy” is either begging the question, or urging upon naturalists a different error, that of confusing a thing with another thing (by defining them as the same). The equal and opposite error in the vicinity, of course, is that nonnaturalists might be denying the identity of a thing with itself (by defining water and H20 as different).
Beyond this schema, Boyd thinks that the properties that make up the goodness cluster tend to come together in certain political and social contexts (like democratic, respectful, egalitarian, courteous, educated societies) where we pursue and somewhat successfully achieve human welfare. For this reason, Adams calls Boyd’s theory “welfarist.” So virtues, right actions, laws or policies and so on earn the predicate “good” when they “tend to foster the realization of these goods” (Boyd 1988, 203). As Adams says (in summarizing Boyd) “The good is more fundamental than the right in his view, and well-being or what is good for people is more fundamental than moral goodness” (Adams 2003, 60).

#### Transgenerational Scientific Disciplines

The correct account of ethical terms as natural kind terms will also include considerations of the inquiry as a whole, the disciplinary matrix. The disciplinary matrix is an interweaving set of terms and projects shared by practitioners and researchers within a discipline. The terms ‘metal,’ ‘tiger ’and‘ goodness’ are currency in chemistry, biology, and ethics respectively. Our account of them should make sense of how experts in that discipline intelligibly converse, form predictions, and achieve successes in that field. It should make sense of how that field or discipline exists across generations.

Boyd’s ambitious project, we can see, is both naturalist and realist. He invokes concepts like natural kinds and disciplinary matrices from his metaphysics and epistemology of scientific realism to build a similar explanation of moral natural kinds and moral inquiry. Unlike “deflationary” naturalists like Mackie, Boyd does not take the (shorter, but more problematic) path of denying that goodness is a real thing.
 
##Robert Adams I: Being For the Infinite Good
Before summarizing the debate between Boyd and Adams, we should say a few words about Robert Adams’ project. At an opposite metaethical extreme from Boyd, Adams represents supernaturalism. Adams’ fascinating Finite and Infinite Goods: A Framework for Ethics is a comprehensive case for, and explanation of, an ethical framework organized around an infinite good (God) who grounds a great variety of finite goods. 

Importantly, as we shall see below, Adams places a high premium on being for the Good. This general orientation towards the good with love and allegiance is critical for Adams and for my comments about Boyd’s critiques. Why is it so critical for Adams? One reason is that one cannot love all finite goods, yet he sees (and I think rightly) that this inability is not a fault. One can love the infinite good — be devoted to it — without loving an unlimited set of finite goods. In fact, one can love the infinite good in and through loving a limited set of finite goods.

A second reason being for is so important for Adams’ account is that we can and ought to love many different kinds of goods: people of various kinds, beauties of art and nature, abstract truths of mathematics and philosophy, and so on. Being for the good (in general) makes sense of our generic aspirations for excellence of many kinds,  and our admiration for those who are able to successful love and exemplify such a variety of excellences, both personal and impersonal. Even when our aspirations are unsuccessful, even in the case of ill consequences of our pursuit of excellence, there is something praiseworthy about the fundamental orientation toward the good.
 
###Adams II: The “Critical Stance” Tells against Naturalism
Adams second chapter of Finite and Infinite Goods takes aim at naturalism. Naturalisms, of which there are many, are united in seeing the good as immanent to either the physical, natural world or at least to human nature — our thoughts, motivations, physiology, psychology, and so on. The transcendence Adams argues for includes (at least) three points: The Good itself surpasses every (finite) good thing. Since the Good is limitless, it explains the (in principle unlimited) potential for new instances and kinds of human and non-human goodness and beauty. Finally, and most importantly for our purposes, the Good being limitless explains why we ought to maintain a critical stance Adams argues is indispensable to our ethical thinking. The “critical stance” is the key theme I want to trace in this paper.

In Chapter 2, section 4, Adams takes aim at (especially) Richard Boyd’s naturalism. The main critique is that (Boyd’s sort) of naturalism allegedly excludes a “critical stance” that is necessary for any ethical theory. Just what is the “critical stance”? Adams’ own summary is this: “For any natural, empirically identifiable property or type of action that we or others may regard as good or bad, right or wrong, we are committed to leave it always open in principle to raise evaluative or normative questions by asking whether that property or action‐type is really good or right, or to issue an evaluative or normative challenge by denying that it is really good or right” (Adams 2002, 78).  Our ethical thinking and practical judgments must be “open” when we judge finite goods to be good. The reason is not (pace G. E. Moore) that we can simply assume the good to be indefinable and then dismiss attempted definitions. Rather, because there is a metaphysical gap between the transcendent, infinite good and any finite thing, our certainty that there is a good is always counterpoised with our uncertainty that this is as good as it seems to us at present. This critical stance is, according to Adams, definitionally a part of our value talk.  He says, “I think the critical stance is part of the general intentional framework in which we use evaluative and normative terms, at least where morality and excellence are concerned, and thus affects the semantically indicated role of such terms.” (Adams 2002, 78) To fail to account for it would be a grave error.

What is wrong with Boyd’s view, according to Adams? Boyd thinks that empirical knowledge — albeit hypothetical, future knowledge — could be enough to settle a question of value. Adams thinks that the “settling” of the question would always and in principle be hasty. Of course, Boyd can accommodate the proper open, critical stance right now, but cannot guarantee that it is the right stance to take in some hypothetical future when our empirical data is perfectly full and adequate.

One final corollary of Adams’ critical stance thesis that Boyd also discusses is that some of our moral beliefs are already (prior to idealized empirical justification) more epistemically secure than some well-grounded scientific theories. Putting the matter a little more sharply, Adams says, “...it would surely be crazier to give up the belief that it would be wicked to torture children than to say that there must be something wrong with quantum mechanics” (Adams 76). Boyd’s naturalist realism seems to entail that even beliefs like the (almost certain) proposition ‘it is wicked to torture children’ are as open to revision as the latest beliefs about sub-atomic particles. Despite Boyd’s attempt to secure such beliefs under the umbrella of ‘quasi-analycity, that openness, Adams thinks, is far too open.

Somewhat more succinctly and less clearly than Adams puts it, we might say that if a  metaethical theory is true, it must include (in the sense of either justifying or at least not contradicting) a critical stance toward ethical judgments and ethical questions. Boyd’s ethical theory — his sort of consequentialist naturalism — does not include such a critical stance. So Boyd’s ethical theory is false.
 
##Boyd II: Partial Denotation &amp; Epistemic Normativity
Boyd’s response to Adams is, largely, to consent that the “critical stance” is critically important (Boyd 2003, 508). So he must show how his naturalism can accommodate it. Where necessary, where naturalism cannot accommodate the “criticalness,” Boyd must show how it is not important. Of course, Boyd clarifies, not every stance that qualifies as ‘critical’ is desirable. Boyd sketches the “critical-stance-on-the-cheap”, in which any conclusion “not analytically entailed by empirical evidence” is falls short of deductive certainty (2003, 524). Empirical evidence just doesn’t underwrite conclusions that certainly.

Of the more substantive openness or criticalness, Boyd thinks it “epistemically correct” to take “something like the critical stance [Adams] articulates” (2003, 513). We are to be open to new insight, new conversation, new challenges to our ethical conclusions because (a) they depend on empirical observations and empirically-based arguments, and (b) such observations and arguments are “complex” and it is difficult to say when they are “definitive” (2003, 513). Consenting to this much, Boyd thinks it is false that the critical stance is “part of our current conception of ethical reasoning” (2003, 514). So how much and what kind of “openness” to reevaluation does Boyd endorse?

Boyd’s overall project is to present epistemic, metaphysical, and semantic considerations that defend or increase the plausibility of naturalist moral realism. It would be impossible to summarize his lengthy article entirely. In this section, I shall attempt to organize Boyd’s instructive responses under two headings: Partial denotation of ethical terms and epistemic normativity. I shall then summarize more briefly Adams’ responses to Boyd before giving my own.
 
###Partial Denotation, Externalism, and Quasi-Analycity
The first consideration Boyd discusses throughout is “partial denotation.” This semantic notion does metaphysical and ethical work. Denotation occurs when language users mean to denote k with term t. Partial denotation is the notion that language users mean to and successfully do denote k1 with term t, but at the same time (erroneously and unintentionally) also denote another kind (k2).  For example, the term ‘species’ partially denotes (and properly so) the concept of a family of, say, animals, or trees, or systems; it also (improperly) implies that species is the same in animal species and a floral species, qua species. Terms partially denote when they bear “a strong reference-like connection” to a kind but the reference-connection is not clean or complete. One way to approach this notion is to think about a natural kind term that has referred to the same natural kind entity for centuries.  How did language users successfully use the term ‘water’ (or ‘lead’) denote H2O (or atomic number 82) before we had the chemical knowledge that water is (atomically) H20 or the chemical makeup of Pb? Boyd’s answer is partial denotation.

This is where “partial denotation” comes in to help keep a place for the critical stance. Partial denotation allows us to give credit to early language users and explain their successful application of terms to the relevant properties while also denying them full knowledge of the referents of those terms, and endorsing our own more advanced knowledge. As Adams phrases it, “If ‘good’ does... indeed signify a real property, there must be a tendency for members of the relevant community of discourse to be approximately right in (much of) what they say about the good, though this tendency may, and almost certainly does, fall hugely short of infallibility” (Adams 2003, 128). Notice that both philosophers are obliged to account for our successes and failures as ethical thinkers, but their emphases are different. Adams can explain why we already grasp the good enough to be for it, but must tell a story about how can err; Boyd can easily explain how we err, but must tell a longer story to explain how we often get the reference of moral terms right.

Another way partial denotation helps Boyd is to develop a plausible externalism. Internalism is the conception that something being good is sufficient reason for preferring it. The good is the admirable, desirable, worthy, etc. by definition. (Needless to say, it may or may not be admired, desired, or ascribed worth — but it is so.) Boyd admits that “it is hard to defend internalism and naturalism simultaneously” (2003, 532). As I understand it, Boyd’s solution is to offer that some terms that definitionally include ‘worthiness of pursuit’ do indeed partially denote things or actions that are worthy of pursuit, but not completely.

How exactly partial denotation works in each case is much less clear. He says that “if we are faced with evidence which seems to establish that the term ‘good’ refers to some natural phenomenon, P, the moral implausibility of P’s being the good can in principle undermine or override such evidence. Moral inquiry has a certain level of autonomy with respect to other areas of inquiry. If one thinks of this autonomy as absolute, then the appeal to partial denotation might be one way to save some sort of moral realism without adopting Adams’ solution” (2003, 531). Yet Boyd denies that moral inquiry is (completely) autonomous. He sees ethical reasoning as “continuous” with other natural and social sciences, both methodologically and ontologically. Each branch of science has a certain level of autonomy, but none complete. So deliverances from its autonomous domain cannot coherently serve as principles that trump the empirical discoveries of any other domain.

As a particular example, Boyd notes that many approbative terms like “just,” “fair” and so on tend to be used in contexts where the referents are convenient to the ruling class. The morally implausible conclusion that the ‘good’ both refers to ‘the convenience of the ruling class’ and that such convenience is in fact good is urged upon us by examining the “reference-like relations” between the use of the term historically and the oftentimes referent. We can be mistaken because the convenience the ruling class is not quite what goodness really is. “We (let’s hope rightly) take ourselves to be informed moral practitioners, and we rely-with serious qualifications-on our own moral judgments as evidential with respect both to the extension of “good,” and the aims of moral practice.” (2003, 545)

To take another particular case of moral implausibility, Boyd discusses the proposition that torturing children is wicked. Boyd (borrowing from Putnam) defines some propositions as ‘quasi-analytic’ — meaning that “even when we know that their justification is a posteriori rather than a priori, we find it extremely difficult to envision circumstances under which they would be disconfirmed” due their “conceptual and methodological centrality.” Changing them requires not simple empirical observations but “pretty serious conceptual and theoretical ‘revolutions’.” He offers two examples of quasi-analytic statements: torturing children is wicked and “the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics” (which he does not further specify).  To empirically confirm that torturing children is wicked, the term ‘wickedness’ picks out a natural property or family of properties “related to human goods and harms” etc., and that our judgments “track this family of properties” (2003, 525). Even though the proposition is ‘quasi-analytic’, the naturalist must remain open in principle to the possibility that empirical investigation could reveal the proposition to be false (in some cases, at some times, etc.). In this way, Boyd hopes to retain room for a kind of critical stance.
 
###Epistemic (Morally-Neutral) Norms
A second key component of Boyd’s case is the primacy of epistemic norms. Can the study itself of ethical terms and properties be value neutral? Boyd imagines an intelligent, amoral, non-human linguist who wants to study the semantics of human languages, but who does not itself have any moral commitments (533). Boyd admits that his scientific realism (the analog to which he is trying to compare or with which he is trying to equate moral realism) is not value neutral; but he says it is moral-value neutral. The only norms (or “values” if you like) in force are epistemic norms governing, presumably those governing valid inferences, likely hypotheses, and so on. For instance, Boyd says that “in deciding what the referent is of a natural kind term, we are seeking to identify... the one which best fits the explanatory role associated with natural kind terms” (2003, 535, author’s emphasis). The notion of a “best fit” is, of course, normative — but epistemically so only. The only normative judgments “involved in determining that the nature of water is H2O ... are purely epistemic judgments about the merits of competing explanations...” (Boyd 2003, 536). Also, strangely, Boyd thinks these norms are hypothetical. He gives a rough example in imperative form: “Classify this way if you want to discover true generalizations about how chemical reactions work” (2003, 536).

Boyd extends his account of these epistemic hypothetical norms that govern practitioners in various disciplines in order to show how an amoral extraterrestrial still might be able to identify the reference of the moral terms of “moral practitioners” over time, accounting for old errors and new improvements (544). He hopes that these reflections show that one need only endorse epistemic norms to “explore the nature of the (moral) good” (2003, 545). In these ways, Boyd tries to bolster his naturalistic account and make room for (one kind of) critical stance.

One final question demands some comment. For Boyd, some of these ethical questions are metaphysically neutral. Ultimately, he believes the kind of openness that is epistemically or morally required depends in some part on one’s prior metaphysical views. Boyd thinks “that in fact neither naturalistic moral realism nor theistic moral realism has any difficulty in accounting for this sort of critical stance” (2003, 526). 

Rather, our approach to the question depends on each philosopher's prior metaphysical reasoning in general, (largely) independent of the conversation about the metaphysics of morals in particular. 

For instance, Adams sees our uncertainty about particular ethical judgments (that X is good, admirable, etc.) as rooted in God’s infinite nature. The unbounded nature of the good makes the a priori delimiting of goods impossible. That account both Boyd and Adam agree *could* be the right one, that it has some plausibility, that it is at least the right kind of account. 

On the other hand, Boyd can build something just as plausible: human nature is such that “uncertainty of knowledge of complex psychological, social, political, and economic factors” make a priori delimiting likewise impossible. “It is a matter of how we, as knowing subjects, are situated in a complex web of physical, psychological, and social causes” (2003, 529). 

But these metaphysical questions Boyd punts to another discussion. He says, “I believe, we should do the relevant metaphysics. If you have (largely) independent reasons to accept theism... then you have reason to accept the deeper metaphysical explanation and justification of for moral doubt” (2003, 530). While keeping two difficult inquiries separate is important for clarity, there is a danger to this strategy, as I shall comment below.

 
###Adams III: On Epistemic Norms
Adams’ paper is a warmly approving and thorough response to Boyd’s “Finite Goods.” They agree on many points. Where they disagree, again, is on the question of a critical stance, on the moral neutrality of epistemic norms, and on the internalism (of identification of the good and motivation).

What is his particular response to Boyd’s brand of critical stance? Adams says, “We do not endorse the same kind of openness.” (2003, 129) Boyd “seems to envisage ... refusing any longer to be committed to being for the good, while still believing that there is a real property... actually signified by ‘good.’” (2003, 130). By contrast, Adams “assumes that [goodness] gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good” (2003, 130). This is a telling critique, and I shall give my best explanation of the difference below.

Adams also differs from Boyd’s putatively ‘value-free’ epistemic norms. Boyd insists that the only normativity operative in identifying natural properties to which moral terms refer is epistemic normativity. Adams argues that “properly-attuned Eros” is response to excellence in a way that allows us to fix the reference of moral terms. Adams admits that Boyd might be able to “domesticate” such a notion into naturalistic account, but the attempt would be dubious. He would have to aver that “causal relationships [are] ultimately decisive for the nature of proper attunement of Eros” (Adams 2003, 130).  Adam’s response is to strongly recommend internalism. Adams affirms existence internalism when he says he “assume[s] that [goodness] is a property that gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good.” (Adams 2003, 130).

Boyd and Adam seem to disagree about what kinds of ethical propositions are up for grabs. Adams summarizes the problem in this way: “It is a serious problem, discussed in more than one place in Finite and Infinite Goods, how to hold firm moral convictions, on points on which one ought to have them, without failing idolatrously to acknowledge the distinction in principle between one's own convictions about the good, even on the most obvious points, and the good itself.” (Adams 2002, 128) As I see it, the dual propositions that we both know the good (irrevocably) and don’t sufficiently know the good (and so must always remain open) are in tension, but both true. The tension demands “a measure of trust, mingled no doubt with caution or distrust, in the stirrings of our own Eros” (131). We can be mistaken about the good and incorrectly apply the term, but we cannot be deeply and pervasively mistaken. The good must be something to which we have “epistemic access” and “epistemic access in the right way, partly through our Eros and other affective volitional responses” (Adams 2002, 131).

For Boyd, the attempt to settle the reference of value terms might need the kind of objective, third-person perspective of an intelligent extraterrestrial. But this leads to strange conclusions. What would an external observer guess is the reference of the term good? Quite often “the convenience for the ruling class”, something Boyd does not admire but that does satisfy or seems to satisfy the reference of the term. Boyd tries to keep ironic distance from endorsing this denotation by admitting that it might be (and is probably) only a partial denotation. For Adams even this admission is too near to a horrible falsehood. He says he would rather give up moral realism entirely than endorse the proposition that ‘the good’ means ‘the convenience of the ruling class.’

 
##Responses
Some of my responses I have already hinted at above. In this section I try to spell out with a little more detail some key points in this debate.  I organize my comments under a few three headings: openness, “third personal” morality, virtue epistemology.
 
###Openness
I began this inquiry with a quotation from Plato because it captures a tension that we shall see is crucial for understanding the debate between Adams and Boyd. For Plato, two seeming paradoxes are thematic, and recur (I think) throughout these writings. The first is that the good is mysterious even to specialists (“dialecticians”) and yet plain to everyone. We ‘divine’ it, but do not know it. The second is that the good is simple and unitary but underlies and causes a bewildering plurality of kinds of goods.

The first paradox is very close to the internalism/externalism debate, and heart of the Boyd/Adams conversation.  For Plato, the belief that P is good moves an agent to act — or rather, the fact that agents pursue P is due to their generic, overriding pursuit of the good. Good things intrinsically motivate pursuit, and our judgments about what is good or bad intrinsically motivates us, at least somewhat. Yet we can still err in judging the wrong thing to be good or in not pursuing the good well enough. There is a balance that Plato’s insight maintains: To emphasize too much our knowledge of the good is to risk undue rigidity and moral hubris. To emphasize too much our ignorance of the good is to risk undue flexibility and moral cowardice. Even today, any ethical theorist has to explain both how we are correct when we think about, talk about, and pursue various goods (beauty, excellence, justice) and how we are incorrect when we err. That we err often is, I hope, obvious. For we do misjudge the good, pursue the bad, whether or not we do so intentionally. That we are not therefore completely or utterly ignorant of the good seems to me equally obvious.

In my reading, one (unstated) reason that being for the good is so central to Adams’ framework is the truth in Plato’s statement above: We “divine that the good is something” (we have knowledge) but are “perplexed and cannot adequately grasp what it is.” Plato (and Socrates) see a truth that seems to me critical: we both know and do not know the good. To deny that we know it through “divination”, intuition, or some such less-than-adequate faculty is to risk betraying the good, to risk not being for the good.

Keeping these dual propositions in mind is the key to my own interpretation of Adam’s critical stance. We must hold two true propositions in view at all times. First, that we know the good, somehow and someway. Adams does not call this knowing an incorrigible intuition, but he does seem to rely on it. But secondly, and just as importantly, we do not know the good sufficiently; we don’t know it well enough to avoid error. Both propositions, and the tension between them, are essential to clear ethical outlook. To lose one would be like closing one eye.

How do these reflections relate to the so-called critical stance? It seems to the choice of the words ‘critical’ and ‘open’ are unfortunate. For, one can be “open” with regard to first principles or open with regard to conclusions derived therefrom. For example, one should be open to the possibility that one’s deductive reasoning, even when the argument seems watertight,  is erroneous in some unforeseen way; one should most emphatically not be open to the possibility that, say, the law of non-contradiction is false. Are there any principles of ethical thinking or practical reasoning that are as irreproachable and incorrigible as the law of non-contradiction is in speculative or theoretical thinking? I think Aquinas’ estimation that the proposition good is to be done and evil avoided qualify as propositions just about as fundamental and obvious as any, within an ethical context or outside (Summa Theologiae, 1-2, Q. 94, Art 2). That we know the good well enough for the proposition ‘the good is to be done’ to be intelligible seems to me a fundamental truth that Plato and many others have clung to.

Even so, as ethical inquiries (those with long histories and those active today) become more detailed, complicated, and practical, the conviction that option A or B is good becomes more difficult to justify with anything like certainty. So here remaining open and critical is the proper epistemic stance.

Boyd, I take it, would say that our success in pursuing the (real) good by name is due to a partial denotation, and the our failures in pursuing it are due to the fact that the denotation is only partial. But Adams has a stronger explanation for our confident that the good is to be pursued antecedently to any but the vaguest notion of what particular properties are conducive to human welfare. We know that excellence is desirable before we know very clearly or very thoroughly what human excellence consists of. Adams seems right that we can even recognize new and unprecedented forms of excellence when they appear to us, because we have first cognized the good.

 
###Third Personal Morality
Now for the second paradox. The Republic quotation highlights that the good is unitary yet causes all kinds of goodness. It is maximally single yet its effects are maximally plural — there are moral goods (virtues, etc.) but also aesthetic goods and many others. The good, therefore, explains all goodness. Like other Platonic forms, the good is the ‘cause’ of all good things insofar as they are good. Equality itself is the cause of equal things being equal. Both explain all instantiations of the given property in various substances. But the range of instantiations for goodness seems wider than that of equality. One can eat good food, have a good social standing, enjoy good health, create and obey good laws, contemplate good theories. Adams appropriates this framework to explain the commonsensical notion that there are not just many excellent things but many vastly different kinds of excellence. He says, “The things that I take to be excellent —  great books, beautiful music, heroic deeds, the dynamic complexity of a living body or an ecosystem — are very diverse, and so are the ways in which they are excellent. I take beauty, moral virtue, and the aptness of a response or interpretation all to be types of excellence” (Adams 2003, 119). Since God is the good, and finite goods are good by resemblance, Adams can account for the dappled and diverse range of incommensurable kinds of goodness.

For the ethical naturalist, a long and difficult account is required to unify all of the things to which we predicate a set of somewhat unified value predicates. If the good is a natural property cluster, Boyd may be quite some distance toward giving an account of just what property clusters are good for us, but he is quite a distance away from giving an account of systems (say, the excellence of an ecosystem) in which humans do not play a major part or any part at all, or of a piece of natural beauty (say, a billion-light-years distant nebula) that has never been and perhaps will never be viewed by human eyes. Intuitively, an ecosystem can be working well, a many-colored nebula can be lovely or admirable even if no (human) appraises it as such. On this front, I think the ethical framework Adams provides is more plausible, other things being equal, than Boyd’s.

Traditionally, ethical thinking and practice have included principles and maxims related not only to the treatment of others and the cultivation of virtue but also attention towards one’s final end. This comprehensive moral view included what we might call first-personal, second-personal, and third-personal dimensions. That is, one important ethical question is who ought I to become? What is psychological order? A second is how ought I to treat you? And you me? A third is What is the proper purpose of human life? Where are we headed? [^6] Boyd, predictably, makes the same narrow move that many modern thinkers do — that of reducing all ethical thinking and practice down to “care for others”. When he talks about the particular contents of a normative ethics (to fill out the details of his metaethical framework) he seems to be thinking only of second-personal morality. When he summarizes the “problems we face in trying to care for each other” as largely “features of social, economic and political structures” (531). He does not think much about human welfare as a species of excellence (say, enjoying excellence as Adams has it), where individual, social, aesthetic, personal goods and so on all participate in the same kind of goodness. The point of these reflections is that the more values we include in our search for a cogent, unified account, the less plausible becomes the notion of homeostatic property clusters for natural kinds. Whether we look at the several different kinds of human goodness, or the innumerable different kinds of nonhuman (aesthetic, biological) goodness, even if we hypothesize that a homeostatic property cluster explains each one, it becomes more and more difficult to even imagine exactly which properties those might be, let alone how one set or cluster of properties is a good-making feature in such different entities.

[^6]: For example, Aristotle writes about eudaimonia as participating in the life of god (3rd-person), about justice (2nd-person) and about moderation (1st-person).  


 
###Virtue Epistemology
On a related point, Boyd’s discussion of epistemic norms assumes that “good explanations” can be epistemically good without being morally good. Adams is right to say that Boyd’s discussion of epistemic norms is the weakest and also the most opaque of his essay. On Adams’ account, moral goodness and epistemic goodness are both species of excellence related similarly back to the (one) infinite good. This latter account much more plausibly fits the prima facie facts. 

I can here only gesture to books like Virtue Epistemology (Oxford, 2001) and the growing field of virtue epistemology . The intuitive premise, according to Ernest Sosa, is this: “Rational beings pursue and value truth” (49). Truth is a value; truth is a good thing. My attaining true beliefs is a good thing, and ought to be pursued. This sense of goodness is not, surely, that of moral goodness in the most narrow sense. But are the two senses completely divorced? When a scientist fakes his data and thus demonstrates a defective devotion to truth, we do not hesitate to apply the term bad, without qualification. Intellectual fraud is, among other things, a moral error. If the (correct) epistemic norms we hold and accord to are or plausibly can be moral-value-laden virtues, then all of the reasoning Boyd constructs on the edifice of a presumptive (moral) value neutrality must be rethought.

The [second] criteria above demands we respect the parity between epistemic and moral norms, between virtues of intellect and will. Boyd denies this parity without argument. Unless he can explain why we should not, we will continue to treat these norms as sharing something in common, even while being distinct. 

These considerations are not decisive; they are not meant to be so. As Boyd points out, the relative merits of the metaphysical accounts behind Boyd (atheism) and Adams (theism) will change the background plausibility of the metaethical accounts. But also, might not the sword cut the other way? Perhaps we should say that the relative merits of our metaethical account will modify the plausibility of our metaphysical theory, be it theistic or atheistic. Our metaethical account examines our ethical stance, after all, a stance which is as close to us as our very hearts. Our examinations of theism and atheism are liable to be aiming at a putative reality foreign and far outside us. 
Nagel's general direction -- start with defeasible morally realist presumptions and build from there to metaphysics and epistemology -- is right. I am more certain that I ought to care for my children and respect my parents than I am convinced all the world is not exhaustively material nor all the world just my perceptions of an unknowable ideas. 
Regardless, our sensitivity to both the “progress” of new truths in natural scientific inquiry and the (relative) stability of at least some truths of ethical inquiry can better explain the reality of goodness, our epistemic access to it, and our successful deployment of ethical terms, points to a framework more like Adams’, where the good itself is transcendent and yet many (and very different) kinds of things can be good by relation to it. The philosophical naturalist who refuses — rightly so, I think — to retreat to moral antirealism has a tough road ahead. He must fully articulate a plausible framework either that accounts for more natural kinds of goodness, or for other kinds of goodness that are not immediately like natural kinds. But much more so, he must fill in the details of real, natural goodness.

            <Title>## Chapter Conclusion</Title>
            <Text>## Chapter Conclusion ##

MacIntyre’s work is difficult to pick apart and summarize or critique in fragments. The compressions of his orchestral arguments in this chapter are inevitably going to leave some readers dissatisfied, perhaps even dismayed, by his theories. what I have made it appear that he is saying. Readers are of course invited to revisit the source. But if my summaries have captured with any accuracy the outline’s of MacIntyre’s contribution to virtue ethics, then we can say a few things with some confidence: virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. 

Differing traditions explain differing accounts of virtue. Though MacIntyre’s career began in straightforward engagement in dialectical disputes about philosophical ethics, it turned a corner when he thought to treat ethical disagreement in a manner analogous to the way Kuhn treated scientific disagreement. The result of turning this corner — MacIntyre’s own paradigm shift — was an account wherein he argues (similarly to some postmodern philosophers) that malleable traditions define standards of rationality, justice, and virtue. But he also argues, to the chagrin of postmodernists, that traditions are answerable to the world, and can be falsified.  He argues that a thoroughgoing cultural relativism (or “tradition-relativism”?) is inadequate. Such a theory holds the promise to explain why various cultures disagree about what qualities are virtues (humility or pride? acquisitiveness or contentment?) and why the same culture disagrees over time with itself about what exactly defines a particular virtue (is chastity moderation of sexual pleasure or just abstinence?) 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


### Chapter Conclusion There are probably natural teloi as well

Now, MacIntyre later changed his mind about the "metaphysical biology" objection. He later thought that it could be answered a second time, even more strongly. It is not just *social teleology* that necessarily exists as part of our human nature; teleology is in some sense part of non-human nature as well. He came to accept the Thomistic and ultimately Aristotelian argument that natural causes include both efficient/material causes and formal/final. He, along with many others, came to believe that modern science has succeeded *in part because of* an enduring belief in final causation or natural teleology, not because of a rejection. The story about scientists dispensing with final causes in biology and astronomy and chemistry is largely a myth. Scientists and philosophers of science abound who can give empirical and rational grounds for thinking nature is riddled with final causation. 

MacIntyre's *ethical* case does not depend on this more robust account of natural teleology. All it needs is social teleology. But if it turned out that social teleology was in *instance* of natural teleology -- that the ends of human nature were a type of the ends of nature per se -- then the framework in which virtues enable the achievement of human ends would certainly be given additional credibility. 

Making the case on behalf of natural teleology I shall not do here. That is a task for the next chapter.

            <Title>Rubin, Synthetic Ethical Naturalism</Title>
            <Text>Synthetic Ethical Naturalism


Author’s Abstract
This dissertation is a critique of synthetic ethical naturalism (SEN). SEN is a view in metaethics that comprises three key theses: 
first, there are moral properties and facts that are independent of the beliefs and attitudes of moral appraisers (moral realism); 

second, moral properties and facts are identical to (or constituted only by) natural properties and facts (ethical naturalism); 

and third, sentences used to assert identity or constitution relations between moral and natural properties are expressions of synthetic, a posteriori necessities. 

The last of these theses, which distinguishes SEN from other forms of ethical naturalism, is supported by a fourth: the semantic contents of the central moral predicates such as 'morally right' and 'morally good' are fixed in part by features external to the minds of speakers (moral semantic externalism). 

Chapter 1 introduces SEN and discusses the most common motivations for accepting it. The next three chapters discuss the influential "Moral Twin Earth" argument against moral semantic externalism. 

In Chapter 2, I defend this argument from the charge that the thought experiment upon which it depends is defective. 

In Chapters 3 and 4, I consider two attempts to amend SEN so as to render it immune to the Moral Twin Earth argument. I show that each of these proposed amendments amounts to an abandonment of SEN. 

Chapter 5 explores Richard Boyd's proposal that moral goodness is a "homeostatic property cluster." If true, Boyd's hypothesis could be used to support several metaphysical, epistemological, and semantic claims made on behalf of SEN. I advance three arguments against this account of moral goodness. 

Chapter 6In the sixth chapter, I argue that moral facts are not needed in the best a posteriori explanations of our moral beliefs and moral sensibility. Because of this, those who accept a metaphysical naturalism ought to deny the existence of such facts or else accept skepticism about moral knowledge. 

In Chapter 7, I consider a counterargument on behalf of SEN to the effect that moral facts are needed in order to explain the predictive success of our best moral theories. I show that this argument fails.

            <Title>## 3 Natural Norms</Title>
            <Text>Introduction

Is normativity natural? Are normative facts part of nature?  In this paper, I make a brief case for an affirmative answer. 
In the first section, I present a presumptive argument for natural normativity. Normative truths can be expressed in Aristotelian Categorical statements of the form all A’s φ. The existence of natural normative facts is best explanation of two other natural facts, both wrapped up in apparent teleology or end-directed phenomena. 
In the second section, I present a battery of seemingly devastating objections to the existence of objective natural norms. Not only does one risk mockery when flying in the face of current philosophical orthodoxy, but some substantive scientific and philosophical objections seem devestating. I argue that these arguments against natural normativity persuade with suggestion more than substance. By contrast, the evidence for natural normativity is fairly obvious, and the traditional explanations can be articulated with a high degree of sophistication, coherence. 
In the third section, since my idiosyncratic interest in natural norms arises partly from my research in metaethics, I conclude by discussing one possible implication of natural normativity within ethical and metaethical conversations. 
In this paper, I draw from eclectic sources, but most from Aristotle, Philippa Foot, and Thomas Nagel. I take my readings of Aristotle and Nagel to be fairly standard; my reading of Foot, on the other hand, extends a bit farther into metaphysical speculation than she herself (following Wittgenstein) is interested in going. I take my thesis to be naturalistic in the broad sense: I am using philosophical and broadly scientific methods in an attempt to observe and explain natural phenomena, and bracketing divine revelation or the existence of supernatural beings. Furthermore, my thesis is naturalistic in that one important governing assumption of ethical naturalism is that humans are continuous with nature (Brown 2009). This naturalism I shall use to push back against one kind of objection. 

Norms
First, what is a normative fact? A normative fact “is what corresponds to a true normative statement” (Schaber). For reasons of space, I shall ask you to join me in simply assuming normative realism. So, value-statements, reason-statements, and ought-statements are refer to different norms. (I will use “norm” and “normative fact” interchangeably). “You ought not hit strangers with a skateboard” is a moral statement, but obviously, not every ought is a moral ought (Thomson 2001). “You ought to drink some hot lemonade” is a prudential norm (Thomson 2001). Drinking the hot lemonade is something you aspire to, rather than a description of how you are behaving. If you do not, your throat may remain sore. Importantly, not every norm uses the word ‘ought’. For example, “Eyes are for seeing,” is a description of their function, purpose, or the end-directed activity of that system. “Eyes are for seeing” is a normative and descriptive statement — that’s what eyes do and what they ought to do. Eyes that cannot see are defective qua eye. “Wolves hunt in packs” is a normative and descriptive statement. 

The basic thesis
So, the basic structure of the argument is this: there are two phenomena, two natural facts, that are best explained by the reality of natural normativity. If those two natural facts are real, then norms are part of nature, nature is normative. 
Consider those two natural facts: the first is end-directed (teleonomic) behavior of natural entities (eyes see, trees grow, stomachs digest); the second is the essentially normative (teleological) cognitive and practical activity of natural humans. The best explanation of each of these facts, and of both together, is that nature is normative.  By nature is normative, we could also say that there are natural teleological laws, natural norms, final causes, natural ends, natural functions. 

Aristotelian Categoricals 
“Wolves ought to hunt in packs” is a statement Foot calls an Aristotelian Categorical (Foot 2002). An Aristotelian categorical is a statement of logical form neither universal nor particular. That is, to assert that all A’s φ is not to distribute φ-ing to all members of the category A, nor simply to assert that some A’s that we have observed were observed φ-ing. 
For example, “all reptiles lay eggs” as universal categorical statement admits no exceptions.  The discovery of a new reptile, say, that gives live birth would not be the discovery of a defective reptile, but a discovery of a new species of reptile. Or rather, it would mean that either this newly discovered creature is not a reptile or that not all reptiles lay eggs. On the other hand, modestly confining oneself to a particular categorical statement like “some reptiles lay eggs” would be radically unambitious science. Our sample size of reptiles that lay eggs is enormous; we are justified in making the inductive leap that all reptiles lay eggs. 
Aristotelian Categoricals, then, are neither simply universal nor simply particular categorical descriptions. They are normative/descriptive judgments. And they are also formed by observation and induction. For example, we observe that many As do indeed φ, and we infer that A is supposed to φ, A is for φ-ing.  Categorical are inductive generalizations with a normative character.  We have observed a sample of A’s φ-ing and we inductively infer that (perhaps) all A’s φ. On the basis of the generalization, the observation that a particular A does not φ does not refute a simply, universal predication but identifies a defect in that particular A. When we observe an exception to a categorical we do not ipso fact debunk our categorical nor are obliged to re-interpret our observation. When learn that all wolves (say) hunt in packs, and observe a wolf hunting alone, we do not debunk the principle that wolves hunt in packs. (Nor do we think that we have discovered a new species of canine that is morphologically and genetically identical to a wolf!) Rather, we have observed that not all wolves are doing what they are supposed to do, not all wolves perfectly exemplify their lifeform.

A Presumptive Case for Natural Teleology
The presumptive case of natural teleology is this. 

	A. Argument for Normative Facts

	1)	If a normative statement is true, it corresponds to a normative fact. (Normative realism)
	2)	Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement. (From observation and induction). 
	3)	Therefore, eyes are for seeing corresponds to a normative fact. (From 1-2)

	B. Argument for Natural Normative Facts. 

	1)	Further, if a normative statement is true about natural entities, then there are natural normative facts. 
	2)	Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement about a natural entity. 
	3)	Therefore, there are natural normative facts. 

Argument (A) assumes normative realism for premise 1.  We learn premise 2 from observation and induction: an Aristotelian Categorical descriptive/normative statement: Eyes are for seeing (stomachs are supposed to digest, wolves hunt in packs, humans ought to think rationally, or what have you). (I) delivers conclusion (3), that there are normative facts. Then, argument (B) provides a simple variation on (A). True normative statements about natural entities correspond to real natural facts. Such normative facts are natural and not merely human, psychological, or projected. And (2) is, I take it, obviously normative and about a natural entity (not something man-made). So (B) delivers our thesis, that there are natural normative facts. 

Objections: It seems that nature is not normative
Let’s consider just a few of the powerful objections to this line of thinking. 
	1.	The first objection is that it is false that eyes are for seeing. Some will say, “Eyes that do not see died out; eyes that see were preserved naturally.” 
	⁃	As far as I can tell, evolutionary backstories about what eyes are and what eyes do has nothing to do with whether they have a real, end-directed function. There is disagreement about whether explanations undermines or underwrites teleological explanations (Brown 2009). All that I need for my argument to work is that possibly evolutionary backstories underwrite natural teleology. The only reason to assume that natural selection is undirected by natural teleology is dogma. If so, call me a heretic. 
	⁃	But is it really possible to doubt that eyes are for seeing? That eyes see is an empirical observation. That eyes ought to see, that eyes that cannot see are defective, is, I insist, equally empirical. It is just as empirical and no more theory-laden than other scientific observations like “all reptiles lay eggs.” 
	⁃	I save one more response to this objection in the last objection.
	2.	A second objection is to cling to an image. On one very powerful picture of the world, nature is a realm of pure descriptive facts. Nature is “bald”, “disenchanted,” and purely physical (McDowell 1996). Nature is an interlocking system of relations, spatial, temporal, and causal. Nature is “the world of quantity, as against the world of quality; of objects as against consciousness… of that which knows no values as against that which both has and perceives value; of efficient causes (or, in some modern systems, of no causality at all) as against final causes.” (Lewis 1943). Some call this the Laplacian picture (Plantinga 2011). On the Laplacian picture, norms are final causes, teloi, ways, and hence must be merely psychological. The Laplacian picture is the scientific picture of nature. So the assertion of norms is unscientific.  
	⁃	By all means, let us be scientific. I have an unwavering pro-attitude toward whatever earns the honorific title of science. If teleological laws are not discovered by scientific methods, then normative facts remain mere hypotheses or pragmatic assumptions or unshakable illusions. But the fact that eyes really are for seeing disproves the Laplacian picture of science. Natural normativity is scientific, and its denial is unscientific. It is empirical, and its denial is dogmatic.  
	3.	A third objection. The existence of natural teleology depends heavily on inferences to the best explanation. But “best” explanation depends in part on background beliefs. If one of our background beliefs is that we believe on good inductive evidence from scientific methods, that there are no natural norms, then appeal to normative facts to explain apparent normative truths like “eyes are for seeing” is blocked. So, on best scientific methods, we must deny the appearances: either normative realism is false, or normative natural facts are merely descriptive with the illusion of normativity. 
	⁃	By “scientific methods”  we mean one of two things: Firstly, when some people say “facts discovered by scientific methods” they do not mean a method at all but a doctrine, in this case, that normativity is not natural. But we can dismiss the dogma since I have given a case that, all things being equal, normative truths (described by Aristotelian Categoricals) are indeed apparently real and are indeed explained by inference to normative facts.  Or, secondly, some people mean by “scientific methods” those  that sometimes use the inference to the best explanation.  Scientists do use inference to the best explanation (abduction, hypotheses, explanation). It is a tool in the scientific tool belt. It is, in fact, ineliminable part of the scientific method. 
	⁃	And that is the kind of inference we used. The explanation of teleological phenomena (by teleological laws) may be wrong but it is not in the wrong ball park. It may be unscientific in the sense that any datum, theorem, proposition, law, or statement that turns out to be false is — ipso facto — unscientific. But it is not unscientific by being simply non-scientific, by being different from the scientific enterprise the way that street lights, rhetorical questions, and Cinderella movies are non-scientific. 
	4.	This is not strictly an objection: but someone might be thinking that the doctrine of natural norms is unpopular, and therefore probably false. If it were true, wouldn’t more scientists believe it? More philosophers of science? More philosophers? More people? My only response to this is that philosophical fashions come and go, and perhaps this particular fashion of denying teleology rests on a mistake; regardless, we can and should consider the argument on its own terms. I have argued that observing natural norms is an empirical business; who knows but that we may see natural normativity becomes the new, justified, scientific consensus? 
	5.	A fourth, very different objection. Suppose we grant that humans are supposed to think rationally is a norm, and a norm about human nature. We are, as a species, capable of advanced cognition and practice. (Those of us who think irrationally and act irrationally are, when we do so, defective.) So why not just explain the appearance of natural norms, of final causes, of purposes, of natural ends, by a combination natural selection and human projection? We are projecting our insides onto nature’s insides. When really, nature has no “inside,” no subjectivity, no consciousness. 
	⁃	Strangely enough, such an explanation divorces humanity from nature. It makes humans mysterious, radically discontinuous, opaque, anomalous, and queer. Since I am here assuming that humans are continuous with nature, I reject an account of teleology that makes it natural only to humans but unnatural to the cosmos as a whole. Furthermore, I have studiously avoided using too many uncontroversial examples of human normativity, preferring the more controversial (and hence more interesting) examples of non-human normative facts. 
	6.	A fifth, and also very different objection. Stephen Brown objects that arguments from an observation that A φ’s to the conclusion that A ought to φ prove too much, since it can be applied not only to non-humans but to non-living things. For example, we could “prove” that our hydrogen star is for radiating energy to the earth; the sun engenders life so therefore it is supposed to engender life. But this seems absurd: tthe sun does not have a purpose, a natural normativity. This is an objection about scope: if there are norms in terrestrial nature, do they extend to the whole cosmos? My presumptive case argues are really real and really natural but may be taken to prove only that norms exist for organic natural entities.
	⁃	On the one hand, I am perfectly content to rest my case. If I have persuaded you of a more modest conclusions, that normative laws obtain only in humans; or they obtain only in living organisms, or even more ambitiously, that they obtain only in organic systems (both organisms and their organs). 
	⁃	On the other hand, Thomas Nagel (2012) makes the case in Mind and Cosmos that teleological (and hence normative) laws are natural to the cosmos as a whole, including inorganic matter. I think there are two good reasons to be maximally ambitious about natural normativity. They are both reductios: suppose that there are natural normative facts about only organic entities, not non-living entities like the soil and the sun. Then we must affirm that when life appeared on earth, a new kind of case appeared as well: final causes. A new natural fact that was never there before, normative natural facts appear. For 13 billion years prior, there was only chance and efficient/material causes. Suddenly, and accidentally, the universe produced not only a new entity but a new kind of fact: normative facts. This sounds to me absurd, though if it does not sound so to you, I’m not sure how to persuade you otherwise. It makes more sense, I think, to suppose that natural normativity was there from the Big Bang forward. A second reductio: In the first objection, we considered that natural selection undermines the appearance of teleology. The problem is that natural selection does not apply to inorganic entities and systems like the soil, the sun, and the stars. There is no interstellar process analogous to genetic drift and the extinction of maladaptive traits. This also sounds to me absurd. The alternative, then, is more likely true: natural norms just are features of all of nature. Teleological normative laws are another brute kind of natural laws. 

Conclusion about Metaethics: Norms unite human nature and non-human nature
What is particularly exciting to me about natural normativity, if it is true, is its implication for ethics. I want to suggest, in closing, that the non-human stuff of the cosmos (quasars, deer, comets) and the human stuff of the cosmos (you and me) share a common structure, and that this underwrites many ethical claims. 
Descriptive natural laws describe formal relational structures at any given moment, a set of stable relations between natural entities; normative natural laws describe relational structures across time; a set of consistent end-directed relations between natural-things-as-they-are and natural things-as-they-ought-to-become. So the explanation for human end-directed behavior and non-human end-directed processes is the same: natural norms. 
Julia Annas puts it this way:  “What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already…” (Annas 1996). Natural normativity underwrites the belief that non-human nature and human nature share a common structure. This is just what ethical naturalism predicts. 
That structure is both formal and final, both descriptive and normative.  And discovering that structure is the joint task of philosophy (metaphysics) and science (the philosophy of nature), since experimental and theoretical methods are both fruitful. This is just what naturalism predicts. 
Ethical living is when we aim to become what we ought to become. Honesty, promise-keeping, rationality, prudence, moderation, perseverance, can be plausibly presented as traits that enable us to become what we are already are and what we ought to be.

            <Text>
11.	Peter Railton

Boyd and Railton are moral realists but ethical naturalists — Railton has playfully described himself as a “stark, raving moral real[ist]” in “Moral Naturalism.” In this essay, Railton summarizes the response of two camps to the conditional proposition that if moral realism is to be make “good sense” then reason or science must “afford a foundation for ethics” (163). The first camp affirms the antecedent and hence the consequent; the second camp denies the consequent and hence denies the antecedent. He admits that “ethical naturalism has yet to find a plausible synthesis of the empirical and the normative” (163). That synthesis Railton attempts, with the modest aim of providing” an analysis of epistemology or ethics that permits us to see how the central evaluative functions of this domain could be carried out within existing (or prospective) empirical theories... [and] how traditional nonnaturalist accounts rely upon assumptions that are in some way incoherent, or that fit ill with existing science...” (164). 

	Railton playfully offers a list of what kinds of views might count as realist: 

1.	Cognitivism — Are moral judgments capable of truth or falsity? Yes or No
2.	Theories of truth — If moral judgments do have truth values, in what sense? 
3.	Objectivity — in what ways, if any, does the existence of moral properties depend upon the actual or possible states of mind of intelligent beings?
4.	Reductionism — Are moral properties reducible to (or do they supervene upon) nonmoral properties?
5.	Naturalism — Are moral properties natural properties? 
6.	Empiricism — Do we come to know moral facts the same way we come to know the facts of empirical science, or are they revealed by reason or by some special mode of apprehension?
7.	Bivalence — Does the principle of the excluded middle apply to moral judgments? 
8.	Determinateness — Given whatever procedures we have for assessing moral judgments, how much morality is likely to be determinable? 
9.	Categoricity — Do all rational agents necessarily have some reason to obey moral imperatives?
10.	Universality — Are moral imperatives applicable to all rational agents, even (should such exist) those that lack a reason to comply with them?
11.	Assessment of existing moralities — Are present moral beliefs approximately true, or do prevailing moral intuitions in some other sense constitute privileged data?
12.	Relativism — Does the truth or warrant of moral judgments depend directly upon individually- or socially-adopted norms or practices? 
13.	Pluralism — Is there a uniquely good form of life or a uniquely right moral code?

A shorter version in my own words of Railton’s “multidimensional conceptual space”: along with Railton’s answer. 
1.	Cognitivism — Can moral judgments be true or false Yes 
2.	Theories of truth — Do moral judgments have normal truth values? No
3.	Objectivity — Are moral properties mind-dependent entities? Yes, relational
4.	Reductionism — Do moral properties supervene on or reduce to nonmoral? Yes
5.	Naturalism — Are moral properties natural properties? Yes
6.	Empiricism — Do we know moral facts the same way as empirical facts? Yes 
7.	Bivalence — Does the principle of the excluded middle apply to moral judgments? Not sure 
8.	Determinateness — Is all morality determinable, some, or none? Not sure
9.	Categoricity — Do all rational agents necessarily have some reason to obey moral imperatives? 
10.	Universality — Are rational agents lacking a reason to comply with a moral imperative required to obey it anyway?  No
11.	Assessment of existing moralities — Are present moral beliefs approximately true, or do prevailing moral intuitions in some other sense constitute privileged data?
12.	Relativism — Does the truth or warrant of moral judgments depend directly upon individually- or socially-adopted norms or practices? 
13.	Pluralism — Is there a uniquely good form of life or a uniquely right moral code?  No

Railton sets up the fact/value distinction as the strongest objection to realism. In its epistemic mode, the objection claims that after all factual, scientific, rational “means of adjudication have been deployed” that value disputes can persist (166). Such an objection depends on a notion of reason as merely instrumental, which Railton endorses (166). But he denies Hume’s “thesis of the practicality of moral judgment” in order to “remove the ground of his contrast between facts and values” (170). 

Railton argues that values are real on the basis of “independence” (the value has “certain determinate features independent of whether we think it exists”) and “feedback” (the ability of us to interact with it and it with us) (172). Railton makes an analogy between value and the external world. The reality of the external world best explains its seeming independence and feedback. 

(The fact that values (non-moral values first) seem to exhibit independence and feedback shows that it is real.) 

The “reduction basis” of a secondary quality like sweetness or desirability is a “complex set of relational, dispositional, primary qualities” such that “in ordinary circumstances sugar excites a certain gustatory sensation in me” (173). Subjective interests are secondary qualities but do not constitute desirableness. To get desirableness, one has to endow an individual A with “unqualified cognitive and imaginative powers, and full factual and nomological information about his physical and psychological constitution, capacities, history, and so on” (174). 

Railton sketches a wants/interests mechanism that explains an agent’s actions. An agent (Lonnie) used to drink milk when he felt sick while travelling, but comes to drink clear liquids because of the positive feedback (albeit unconscious feedback) he gets from drinking 7-Up. The explanation is that Lonnie’s subjective interest (his wants) has come into closer alignment with his objective interest (the desirability of clear liquids). The objective interest is defined as a set of relational facts

The wants/interests mechanism gets us objective non-moral value. How does Railton bridge the gap to moral value, to rights and wrongs? 

Morality is rationality from a social point of view — “what would be rationally approved of were the interests of all potentially affected individuals counted equally under circumstances of full and vivid information” (190). The “feedback” of irrational or normatively wrong social behaviors a “potential for dissatisfaction and unrest” (191). 

Sharon Street categorizes Railton as an antirealist since the natural properties that constitute value properties are the attitudes of an agent, albeit an ideal agent. The values are not attitude-independent. % Street, “A Darwinian Dilemma for Moral Realists”. </Text>

            <Title>Love and Virtue</Title>
            <Text>Can objective moral truth be known by any rational observer, regardless of the agent’s moral character, point of view, background beliefs? 
Robert Fitterer (2008) argues that some emotions, especially an agent’s love, is a precondition for seeing the objective ethical truth. Hursthouse (1999) is somewhat sanguine about denying that ethical truth can be achieved from an “external” third-person perspective — what particular ethical judgments shore up our continued reflection? Thomas Nagel (1989) thinks that objective and subjective standpoints are both valid even though they sometimes contradict. Alasdair MacIntyre is famous for asserting that all arguments, including his own, issue from within a “tradition” and can only be judged from within that tradition but also denying that his position leads to relativism. Talbot Brewer’s (2009) passionate plea for a retrieval of ethics is also a retrieval of the self — he shies away from Iris Murdoch’s more gutsy locution: recovering the soul. 

In this essay, venture into these treacherous waters. My inquiry shall follow the lead Anscombe, MacIntyre, Murdoch, and Brewer. My antagonist, not through ill-will but through a need for dialectical interlocutors, will be Hursthouse and Nagel. Nagel is too pessimistic that the “objective” viewpoint is the scientific one — assuming as he does (and many others) that empirical and quantitative science is all there is to science; instead, I propose, optimistically, that the subjective viewpoint is scientific, since theoretical and qualitative science are also science. And Hursthouse (and with her, John McDowell) are too optimistic about the Neurathian project of rebuilding our ethical outlook from within, without being impinged upon by objective (stance-independent) moral reality that is “out there.” The correct balance — no, not balance: the correct union of wild optomism and wild pessimism is in Robert Adams, for whom simply being for the good is enough to begin one’s journey to objective moral truth; but being for the good is only a beginning, with a thousand distractions and obstacles that get in the way to becoming truly virtuous. 
In the virtue ethical framework we have been developing, there is only one narrative: our life is unfolding dialectically along cognitive and practical lines, as we strive for wisdom and for virtue. Each step of “progress” is not progress for the human race or the culture but for the person progressing. 






Fitterer first demonstrates how certain cognitive operations set out in Aristotelian virtue ethics can indeed arrive at objective moral truth precisely through the contribution emotions make in moral discernment. Then, drawing on Lonergan's notion of inductive insight, he argues that objectivity is the result of the properly functioning subjectivity of a moral agent. Finally, building on his study of Nussbaum's ethical writings, Fitterer concludes that compassionate love is an attitude that actually fosters the likelihood of discerning and choosing the genuine good, and encourages objectivity in moral decision-making.</Text>

Overview:
Synopsis:
Naturalis is a paradigm and method, hopeful of monism in method and in object. 

75 “Modernity is the conflict and confluence of the Enlightenment and the Romantic Counter-Enlightenment cognitive views, each subverting and delegitimating the other's conception of human nature, truth, morality, politics and the appropriate method for knowing them.” 

75-76

But by the end of the 18th century only instrumental reason survived skeptical challenges to the intuitions of Enlightenment Modernity. A new phase of Modernity, Romantic Modernity, arose in cultural protest against the disenchanted, despiritualized, increasingly mechanized, technological world of Enlightenment scientific reason; and it arose in political protest against the Enlightenment, waging the Wars of Liberation from Napoleon, the symbol of Enlightenment domination. Romantic Modernity arose as a cognitive framework linked to Enlightenment Modernity as its antithesis. The intuitions of Romanticism crystallized into a counter-framework of opposing conceptualizations: in opposition to Enlightenment primacy of reason, Romanticism affirms the primacy of spirit; in opposition to the scientific focus on fact and externality, Romanticism takes the inward path of subjectivity; in opposition to scientific reason in its pursuit of objective and valid knowledge, Romanticism holds to the truths of history, culture, the arts, the dialectic of personal and collective will; in opposition to the natural rights political autonomy of the Enlightenment individual, Romanticism asserts a politics of the group, of collectivism of the left or right; in opposition to Enlightenment-style rational liberation from the historical domination of church and state falsity, Romantic liberation is from the hegemony of the Enlightenment mentality in its abstract, ahistorical universalism, objectivism, and realism, and from the resulting bureaucrati- zation of the social world. Here in Romantic Modernity we discover the counter- tradition to the Enlightenment.”
III. American Naturalistic Pragmatism and the Conflicts of Modernity

76 “America was born into modernity with the sailing of the Arabella in the spring of 1630, arriving in America in late June under the dissenting religious banner of the Protestant Reformaton...”

77 “Classical American philosophy (naturalistic pragmatism) came into being as an intellectual and moral response to the post-Civil War national problematic situation brought on by the effects of Enlightenmet modernization on American life”

78 Naturalism is continuity of analysis between all kinds of investigation. A “single model of inquiry appiciable to problem-solving in everyday life and in all areas of the natural and social sciences”. 

Pragmatism avoids the errors of idealism and anti-foundationalism and traditionalism — and affords us the wisdom avialble in our time.

            <Title>Dissertation Proposal D1</Title>
            <Text>Thesis and Introduction 
Neo-Aristotelianism virtue ethics is the naturalistic ethical theory par excellence. It is a satisfying, powerful explanation of ethical discourse; it is an inspiring, useful guide to living our excellent lives; and, despite objections, it is compatible with all the non-trivial requirements of of a thoroughly naturalistic philosophy. 
Providing excellent arguments for these claims will be the labor of my dissertation.

Importance
The doctrines about humanity, nature, and ethics derived in part from Aristotle are not only significant for their historical place in western civilization but for their contemporary place in debates over moral and normative realism and moral and normative naturalism. Virtue ethics is not the majority view (about 18.2% according to the Chalmers survey) but has a substantial share of allegiance.Chalmers, “What Do Philosophers Believe?” p. 12.  
The “banner” of naturalism, on the other hand, is significant as the contemporary “orthodoxy” of public, secular philosophy.  In a field where disagreement is virtually a requirement, the “metaphilosophy of naturalism” boasts the allegiance of a full half (49.8%) of analytic philosophers.Chalmers, “What Do Philosophers Believe?” p. 12. 
Is neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics really naturalistic? The answer to this question will be highly interesting to naturalists and nonnaturalists in the metaethical debate over the foundations of ethics. 

Background on Aristotelianism and Neo-Aristotelianism
	Virtue ethics has undergone a renaissance in the last 60 years or so. Neo-Aristotelieanism is still a protean concept, but I take it to be a set of ethical doctrines about happiness, virtue, human flourishing, and practical wisdom. 
	Of course, there is a metaphysical framework for such an ethical theory. Every natural object has a natural end or “final cause.” Thus, happiness is the natural end of human life. 
	Beyond this, Aristotle, taught, the life worth living is the happy (eudaimon) life characterized by virtuous activity, especially practical wisdom. The virtuous man or woman is happy, or well on the way (depending on whether virtue is merely necessary or also sufficient condition for happiness). The happy person is not simply morally good in the thin sense, but achieves both “theoretical and practical” virtues (we might say “epistemic and moral” virtues). Calling virtuous persons “phronomos” or practically wise denotes more than calling them “good”. Practical wisdom does not merely denote the knowledge of morally wrong actions one must not do and categorical duties one must fulfill; it denotes the property of being excellent at identifying the proper reasons for doing things, the knowledge of what to do. The phronemos person fulfills her duties and does not violate the rights of others, but also she is well-ordered within herself, and intelligently situated within her community and even the cosmos.  Virtuous activity is a sort of master skill, a skill both responsive and active in turns, that unifies many virtues into one coherent, balanced, musical way of living each day.
	Happiness is defined in terms of virtue. What is virtue? The particular virtues are character traits (like dispositions, deeply-seated habits, or skills) that contribute to well-being or happiness. The virtues are commonly listed out: the Greek big four are justice, courage, practical wisdom, moderation. Alternatively, we might add to the list any character trait that passes the test, that can be shown to guarantee or contribute to a good human life (like compassion? humility? ambition?). The list of virtues is certainly topic of some controversy, but the controversy is or should be “in house” controversy. That is, for present purposes we should focus on those lists that are relatively uncontroversial (does anyone think justice is a vice or recklessness a virtue?). But of course, those who incline toward virtue ethics can undertake the worthwhile task of comparing and contrasting differences amongst contemporary writers, differences between old and new lists, between eastern and western virtues, religious and secular  virtues, and so on. But I shall leave these esoterica for future research. In my dissertation, I shall refer to the relatively undisputed Greek set of virtues, and add a few “modern” virtues that I dare hope will not be stumbling blocks.
	Now, so called neo-Aristotelians have been offering their theory as a form of ethical naturalism. Neo-Aristotelians freely differ from that Athenian whenever his opinions seem plain wrong in light of our modern worldview. But they agree with much of the above set of primary ethical theses. Nature is teleological; humanity is continuous with nature; human nature has a pre-defined end; that end is (something like) happiness or flourishing;  and our evaluative judgments of particular humans track (or try to track) how well a person is realizing that human end. These doctrines together may be categorized as a kind of naturalistic, metanormative realism. 

Background on Naturalism and Ethical Naturalism
	What is naturalism per se? Naturalism is, if it were possible, an even more nebulous movement. The term gestures at a family of doctrines, attitudes, methods, social groups. For instance, it is used to refer to doctrines (a belief in the continuity of nature and the fundamental unity of the sciences), attitudes (a high degree of trust in modern scientific inquiries, an optimism about scientific research into human nature), skepticism about religion (from the yawning apathy of Colin McGinn, to the vociferous denial of Michael Ruse), methods (the scientific methods, empiricism, pragmatism), and even social groups (as a banner for atheists, a banner for the empirically-minded). 
Is there anything that unifies these disparate senses of the term? Naturalism is, I think, hopelessly equivocal, and yet ‘naturalism’ is also a powerful by-word, a signal word, and means something to almost everybody in philosophy. We cannot simply retire it without rendering opaque a great body of literature from the past two hundred or so years. But we cannot, I submit, continue to use it without rendering opaque our inquiries into science, epistemology, ethics, and more. 
Giving an intelligible account of naturalism is something I will undertake in the dissertation. For now, let us be content with giving the “spirit” of naturalism and its contrast to non-naturalism: naturalists place a high degree of trust in the sciences for learning about nature but also human nature including ethics and normativity.  Non-naturalism, which judges that some non-scientific ways of knowing normative facts are available to us and/or that some unscientific entities exist (be they supernatural gods and Cartesian souls or preternatural ghosts). Alternately, nonnaturalists simply affirm that some norms are authoritatively binding, not attitude-dependent, and inexplicable in the language of “natural” (non-normative) terms.Finlay, Stephen. “Four Faces of Moral Realism” p. 19-20.  
	Ethical naturalism has two very different branches, one broad and one narrow.This is the view Papineau summarizes.  Papineau, David, "Naturalism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/naturalism/&gt;.Most broadly, the wider family of non-cognitivist and anti-realist theories that are compatible with naturalism per se, including emotivism, prescriptivism, expressivism, error theory, factionalism.  I call all  these non-cognitivist and error-theoretic theories under the pejorative term ‘nihilism’. Nihilists argue that statements in our normative discourse are either not genuinely assertoric or they are massively mistaken in some way.Rosen, “Objectivity and Modern Idealism” p. 278.  These views I take to be disastrously false. Views that can be shown to entail nihilism, can be shown to reduce to absurdity. Nevertheless, nihilistic views are helpful as heuristics and correctives. The nihilist, for one, correctly identifies the “objectionable features” of normative facts and true normative judgments. Normative facts purport to be intrinsically motivating, normative judgments purport to be categorically binding, and so on. These features do need a satisfactory analysis within naturalistic realism.
	More narrowly, ethical naturalism denotes a family of cognitivist, moral or normative realisms. Some moral or otherwise normative facts exist and so some of our evaluative terms are intelligible; some moral or otherwise normative judgments are true, Ethical and otherwise normative facts are real but belong not to some supernatural or platonic realm; they somehow belong to nature. All facts are natural facts in some to-be-determined sense of natural.  
	The various ways to parse this claim give various definitions of nature and various accounts of the relation of “dependence” or “belonging to” nature: normative facts supervene on nonnormative facts; normative facts emerge from nonnormative ones; nonnormative facts ground normative facts; normative facts just are nonnormative facts differently understood, and so on. 

Metaethics and ethics
	The debate about naturalism versus nonnaturalism is a metaethical debate. The received wisdom is that our commitment to primary ethical and normative concepts (duty, virtue, pleasure, the divine will, rationality, etc.) are non-trivially distinct from our metaethical story about the foundations of ethical and normative concepts. We might both be consequentialists or virtue ethicists but give different accounts of the metaphysics of pleasure or analysis of normative words. This received wisdom is wise.
	Yet the connection between one’s metaethical and primary ethical positions is not random. Matthew Kramer has argued that moral realism is a (first-order) moral doctrine. Thomas Nagel agrees by arguing that the only way to argue for moral realism is to keep focussed on the normative “weight” of primary ethical values — we must refuse to get lost in the metaethical quandaries for too long.  Perhaps this is related to Margaret Little persuasive argument that caring about the ethical issue is (in some cases) not a bias but an aid to seeing the salient facts. An animal rights activist, say, who cares strongly about the unjust suffering of industrial farm animals might appeal to metaethical arguments to defend her normative realism, but her opponents should not accuse her of “caring too much” to be “objective.” If Hursthouse and McDowell’s argument that ethical facts can only be seen from “inside” an ethical standpoint is true then the attempt to see moral facts from an “outside” perspective is not just misguided but ethically risky.
 	Furthermore, some primary ethical theories “fit” better with some metaethical theories. Ethical naturalism of a more reductive or scientific flavor fits best with consequentialism. Ethical non-naturalism bets fits with ethical platonism or theism. Ethical naturalism of the non-reductive sort seems to me to an overwhelmingly good fit for virtue ethics. So combining ethical naturalism with neo-Aristotelianism we come up with neo-Aristotelian naturalism. My primary research question asks: is neo-Aristotelianism sufficiently naturalistic? 

Neo-Aristotelianism seems naturalistic enough 
 The generally accepted answer is yes. Thus, Rosalind Hursthouse:  “Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism—broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being.”Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics  p. 192.  Elizabeth Anscombe who ignited the modern revival of neo-Arisotetelianism in ethics offered virtue concepts as alternatives to inherently theistic concepts like law and absolutely binding obligation. 
Philippa Foot’s attitude to establishing her naturalistic credentials is far more sanguine. She merely aims to account for evaluations of humans as logically and grammatically identical to evaluations about animals and plants. (The influence of Wittgenstein can be clearly seen in her strong emphasis on natural language and her occasional lack of curiosity about metaphysics.) John McDowell avers that his brand of neo-Aristotelianism about ethics is naturalistic, though he is compelled to distinguish between a more reductive sort of naturalism and a more “relaxed” sort. 

Neo-Aristotelianism does not seem naturalistic enough 
	But “general acceptance” is not justification. Some have worried that a traditional virtue ethic and a thoroughgoing naturalism are incompatible or at least uneasy bedfellows. Depending on how we define naturalism, the question can be specified a few ways: Can we learn about human nature, human virtue, human happiness, and practical wisdom (and even become virtuous, wise, and happy) from natural sciences? Are virtue properties natural properties? Are happy persons natural entities? 
	And especially, is human nature continuous with nature? Some ethical naturalists are content to relegate all value to humanity (all value thought and talk) and leave it at that. I do not think this kind of “naturalizing” is in the spirit of naturalism. Naturalism it seems is more ambitious than to be content with just “basing ethics in some way on… human nature.” Can virtue ethics be harmonized with the naturalistic approaches? 
	The worry can be teased out into four related objections. Each highlights a real or apparent tension between unmodified virtue ethics and unmodified naturalism. 

	1)	Divinity objection: Virtue ethics has been traditionally the purview of theists, from the divine nous of Aristotle to the divine logos of the Stoics to the divine Trinity of Aquinas, and orthodox naturalism tends to be atheistic, agnostic, or post-theist (apathetic).  If we come to believe that humans participate in the divine nous, are indwelt by a divine spark, or made in the image of God, it seems that we have left naturalism far behind. 
	2)	Teleology objection: Virtue ethics assumes or argues for teleology in nature, without which evaluations of living things including humans cannot get off the ground. An individual cactus or deer is evaluated by how well it instantiates the lifeform of its species. By contrast, Darwinism or neo-Darwinism is orthodox biology that is committed, it seems, to the view of disenchanted nature as a mono-causal order of efficient and material causation without final causation.  The orthodox “transformism” that has held majority sway since Darwin implies that lifeforms are essentially plastic or fluid, which entails that deviation from the norm may be a defect or simply a new adaptive mutation. Marinus Ferreira, “Reasons from Neo-Aristotelian Naturalism”   Stephen Brown articulates the objection that there may not even be a human lifeform, in which case the basis for ethical and other normative evaluations is gone. Stephen Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue”, Ethic@, Vol. 4., n. , P. 7-22, 2005.  
	3)	Normative human nature objection: Virtue ethics also assumes that human nature or the human lifeform is so to speak normatively loaded. The very term virtue (a cognate of the Latin word for man) implies that humanity is a normative concept; a human can become fully human or inhuman. That is, one can fail to achieve one’s own humanity or one can become truly human.  Some ethical naturalists also put themselves at risk of this objection, when they ground normative facts and “queer” values in humanity as if that were enough. For instance, Hursthouse says hers is an  enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being”Hursthouse 193. Consequentialists try to demystify “queer” values by grounding them in humanity somehow (our interests, desires, judgments, evaluations, natural ends, etc.). The assumption is that human nature is “natural”, so if values are “humanized” then values become natural. But the shoe could fit the other foot. A critic could object that values are nonnatural so if values are humanized then human nature is nonnatural. Quite possibly, humanizing these mysterious values doesn’t naturalize them, but rather mystifies humanity. By contrast, “A fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature”.Brown 2004, p. 4. McDowell sees the parity between reason and practical reason, and so naturalizes both in “second nature.” Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. The point is that if humanity is discontinuous with nature then we seem to have a bi-furcated naturalism that violates the continuity of nature.
	4)	Discontinuity of rationality objection: Virtue ethics seems to elevate the status of humanity above other animals and perhaps the rest of nature. More specifically, it tends to make reason and practical reason “special” or discontinuous with nature. For instance, Julia Annas asks: “Does …[a strong] relation between our rationality and the rest of our human nature as social animals give us a plausible form of naturalism? We might think not, if we think that the Aristotelian form is a plausible one. For it stresses continuities between the evaluative patterns in our lives and those that are to be found in the lives of plants and animals. The fact that we are rational animals makes a big difference…”Annas, “What kind of naturalism?” She notes that the more we emphasize our rationality, the less important appears that which we share with the rest of nature (our animality and materiality). She seems to endorse the stronger form of rationality despite the tension. Stephen Brown on the other hand is willing to bite the bullet that some or all of the normative authority of our rationality might be lost if we concede that humans are really continuous with plants and animals. He somewhat regretfully admits (while defending neo-Aristotelian naturalism!) that his uncompromisingly naturalistic virtue ethic “amounts to a kind of evolutionary ethics and, in the end, is fundamentally descriptive” Brown, Moral Virtue and Nature 1. He notes that the more we emphasize our common ancestry, our basic biological animality and (ultimately) origin of all living things in non-living chemicals and elements, the less important appears our normative rationality.  

	These four related worries individually and together pose a serious threat to neo-Aristotelianism. The threat is both dialectical and rhetorical, since they threaten the theory’s truth as well as (even if it is true) its palatability and plausibility to the thousands of philosophers who are naturalists. (Alternately, they pose a threat to naturalism, threatening to prove it false or make it seem implausible to neo-Aristotelians.)

Three responses
	The general feeling is that there is an inverse proportionality between unmodified naturalism (denying divinity, teleology, affirming the continuity of human nature and rationality with the rest of nature) and the degree of unmodified Aristotelianism (affirming the teleology of nature, humanity’s normative nature, our rationality and practical rationality, and divinity). Therefore, three possible responses to the tension reveal themselves. (1) neo-Aristotelianism is naturalistic even without modification, and so much the worse for naturalism; or (2) Neo-Aristotelianism is not naturalistic without modification, and so much the worse for virtue ethics; or (3) both have to be modified (“neo”-Aristotelianism and “relaxed” naturalism) but a real compromise is possible. 
	(1) The first response just accepts Aristotelianism without worrying about the divinity, teleology, human nature, or rationality objections. It accepts, for example, the following truth claims: we can learn about happiness, virtue, and wisdom (and maybe even become virtuous, wise, and happy) in a manner consistent with natural scientific study, especially evolutionary biology, anthropology, but also perhaps perhaps psychology, sociology, economics, politics.  Virtue properties, when they obtain, are natural properties. E.g., practical wisdom is a natural feature of some human beings; courage, justice, magnanimity etc., are natural features of some human beings.  A happy human is a natural fact, like a thriving oak tree or healthy lion.  Human nature is continuous with all of nature because it is just another animal nature. A person expressing human nature in its fullness, is continuous with nature because he or she is a living thing. Knowledge and value, reason and practical reason, epistemology and ethics, are continuous with psychology, biology, etc. 
	(2) The second response just rejects Aristotle’s framework outright on the basis of one or more of those objections. Those who take this response rummage through the other available forms of ethical naturalism for another brand of moral realism or else gives up on moral realism altogether. Perhaps other objections also come into play: The very concept of virtue is undercut by modern evolutionary biology.Williams, Bernard. “Evolution, Ethics, and the Representation Problem” in Making S ense of H umanity, 1995.  Virtue is inherently hierarchical, and hence elitist, sexist, undemocratic, and so on. Virtue is tainted both by its origin in pre-modern and oft-times religious origins. 
	(3) The third response — really, a family of solutions — finds a compromise. This is the solution of John McDowell and Rosalind Hursthouse. They note the same tension above between robust moral realism that captures normative authority and the straightforward reductive account of nature, human nature, and rationality that seems to abolish it. Hursthouse says, “The pretensions of an Aristotelian naturalism are not, in any ordinary understanding of the terms, either ‘scientific’ or ‘foundational’. It does not seek to establish its conclusions from ‘a neutral point of view’.” Hursthouse 193. This third way sees nature as “partially re-enchanted”. The question is whether this third way is possible.  

My contribution
	I aim to adjudicate between these options in my dissertation. Not only answering the questions in the terms posed, but questioning the governing assumptions in the literature, I aim to sort out definitions, clear truth claims, objections, and responses on each of these topics, in order to  allow naturalists to decide clearly the theoretical costs and benefits of adopting neo-Aristotelianism as their preferred form of ethical realism. 
	Combining ethical naturalism with neo-Aristotelianism we can indeed defend a naturalistic virtue ethics. In short, neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is both an adequate ethic and adequate metaethic for naturalists and non-naturalists —  it is true as a metaethic and useful as an ethics. 

Chapter Outline
	To establish my thesis that Neo-Aristotelianism is the naturalistic ethical theory par excellence even for secular philosophers will require three parts. In the first part, I have to take seriously an apathy about virtue ethics and explain why neo-Aristotlianism is so attractive as an ethic and as a metaethic. In the second part, I shall critique rival ethical naturalisms. And in the third part, I shall respond to the four objections listed above, offer a novel definition of naturalism that allows even naturalist philosophers to enjoy the many benefits of neo-Aristotelianism. 
	In part 1, In chapter 1, I do some background work has to be done to show that building a compromise is even worthwhile. This will be done through a novel presentation of four metaethical explananda we are trying to explain with our metaethical theories. Moral or otherwise normative antirealists will view all this fuss as needless. Normative discourse is not truth-apt, or it is but universally fails to represent normative facts. So some account is needed to motivate moral realism. (Thankfully, I can stand on astonishing body of good work on moral realism in recent decades.) These explananda, I shall argue, are real phenomena that stand in need of a morally realist explanation. 
	In part 1, chapter 2,  I shall provide a a clear and detailed presentation of the metaethical and primary ethical tenets of (my version of) the virtue ethics in question. I briefly tell the story of virtue ethics’ reception before and since the Enlightenment, and highlight some important distinctions among modern neo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists like Anscombe, Foot, Hursthouse, McDowell and Smith. Morally realist ethical naturalists of various stripes (consequentialists, reductive physicalists, quietests, etc.)  will wonder what is all the fuss about Aristotle. So we need to motivate why it is worthwhile revisiting the old philosopher. This account shows neo-Aristotelianism’s power as an explanans, a power that contains rather than competes with deontological considerations (about the rationality of morality) and utilitarian considerations (about the consequences of right action). 
This exposes in starker relief how the worry about naturalism justifiably arises especially in regards to the relation of human nature to the rest of the cosmos. These worries are summarized in my four objections. 
	In part 2, chapter 3, I critique other ethical naturalisms. There are many, but the main options I consider are: strict or reductive naturalism (i.e., physicalism like that of Frank Jackson’s), the scientific consequentialism of Richard Boyd and the Cornell Realists.  I also briefly consider the sort of rationalistic quietism of Thomas Nagel. I shall object to each of these theories individually but also critique them all as failing adequately to account for the metaethical explananda laid out in chapter 1. 
	In part 2, chapter 4, I examine in more detail the “relaxed” naturalisms of the neo-Aristotelianism of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Rosalind Hursthouse. I show that the problem of discontinuity resurfaces with reference to human nature. 
	In part 2, chapter 5, I undertake a novel definition of naturalism. First, I shall offer a clear and detailed definition of the wide variety of naturalisms in an attempt to distill out the core concerns, the sine qua nons, of naturalists. Since the term ‘nature’ is the most equivocal and ambiguous in our language, this will necessitate a detour into the concept of ‘nature’ and that which often defines it, science.  The demarcation problem for philosophers of science threatens a similar demarcation problem for naturalists, since most philosophers define nature in terms of “what science studies.” So naturalism must remain either as indeterminate as the deliverances of science (which does not exclude the “supernatural”) or must define itself apart from science (which separates it from materialism). In light of this problem, I propose that naturalism commit itself, in light of the past and present successes of empirical inquiry, to the continuity of all of existence and of all knowledge. This commitment is compatible with continuities (like the ancient Stoics) rooted in a divine logos or nous. 
	In part 3, chapter 6, I revisit the four objections in light of our new definition of naturalism and offer a persuasive answer as to whether neo-Aristotelianism falls under those criteria. The conclusions I draw are as follows: (1) I concede that virtue ethics fits well with theism but argue that it is compatible with atheism; (2) I argue that virtue ethics is necessarily teleological, and so that teleology is compatible with naturalism. (3) I defend the normativity of human nature and argue that naturalism must adopt normativity; (4) I argue that virtue ethics is necessarily non-reductively rational and that rationalism can and should adopt this, and that it does not violate the continuity of nature. 
	In part 3, chapter 7, I shall address any dangling objections or possible misgivings, summarize my positive conclusions, and search out any gaps or weaknesses in my arguments that might need supplementation. 

The proposed outline, then, is as follows:
	I.	Why Metanormative Realism and Virtue?
	1.	Metanormative Realism and Nihilism
	2.	Contemporary Virtue Ethics and Four Objections
	II.	Is Human Nature part of Nature? 
	1.	Scientific Ethics? The Bald Naturalism of Jackson, Boyd
	2.	“Second Nature” Non-Reductive Naturalism of Nagel, McDowell, Hursthouse
	3.	Nature and Science: The Demarcation Problem for Naturalism
	III.	Naturalistic Neo-Aristotelianism?
	1.	The Four Objections Answered: The Continuity problem solved
	2.	Clarifications, Implications, Objections, and conclusions

### Summary of *Natural Goodness*

Philippa Foot’s original theorizing has earned her many admirers and critics. Rosalind Hursthouse is a follower. From Wittgenstein’s highly idiosyncratic and penetrating chains of reasoning, Elizabeth Anscombe and Foot took inspiration to form their own style of writing and theorizing. 

Foot’s ethical naturalism is one of two or three kinds of virtue theories that are avowedly naturalistic. What exactly qualifies each as ‘naturalistic’ will of course be a subject of some dispute in the discussion that follows. But each of these virtue theorists lays claim to the title or banner of naturalism. So we will consider each in turn. 

Foot’s theory as expressed in Natural Goodness I take to be the following theses:
1. The semantic meaning of evaluative terms like ‘good’ follows the same semantic structure as other terms — this is the ‘conceptual pattern of natural normativity’. 
2. Norms govern each living biological organism according to its natural excellence and defect. 
3. Humans are living biological organisms.
4. Norms govern humans according to its natural excellence and defect.
5. Among the norms uniquely governing humans are norms of practical rationality. 
6. 

After explaining how natural normativity applies to humans, Foot addresses the objection related to what I have called the anomaly or "just too different" objection, that humans are saliently distinct in kind from plants and animals in that humans are rational. She does think that our rationality is sui generis among the animal kingdom. Other animals act but we *act on reasons*. We choose on rational principles (Aquinas) or act on *logos* (Aristotle). Animals, by contrast, and small children, *incline* this way rather than that. They may pursue ends but they do not pursue *ends qua ends*. A sheep sees green grass but does not *see that* the grass is green and that green food is most often healthful. Animals participate in choice as they participate in knowledge. Crows can be said to know that X will lead to Y [@crows 1][@crows2] but they do not know X *as a means* to Y. The distinction may seem arbitrary but Foot thinks (and I agree) it is important. Seeing something *qua end* is not a special mode of perception over and above visual perception nor is it something we can discern through "Lockean introspection" [@foot2003n 55]. Rather, following Wittgenstein, it has something to do with language. Humans use language to justify and explain choices. Children come to use language in this way. As she says, "When we say that human beings are able to choose *on a rational ground* as no animal can, it is because human action belongs in such surroundings, and so, ultimately, because humans use language not matched by anything in animal life." [@foot2003n 55] A formula she provides that I find helpful is this: animals pursue the *good they see* while humans pursue *what they see as good.* An animal may display hesitation when "torn between hunger and fear" or like Buridan's ass torn between two desires, but there is no behavior in the animal whose explanation demands we posit rational deliberation. 


This objection is closely related to another objection (presumably from a moral skeptic or immoralist) that perhaps we have no reason to do what good human beings must do. This objection concedes that 'action A is necessary for being a good human' but asks "What if I do not care about being a good human being?" [@foot2003n 52] She borrows a question from Gary Watson who wonders whether any morally realist theory can show that being a gangster is incompatible with being a good human being" [@foot2003n 53]. She wants to show that it is. 

###Foot and Nagel's Rationalism
Foot's rationalism sounds a lot like Nagel's. For Nagel, we simply see some states of affairs *as* grounds for doing this and not that; we see some states of affairs as justifying acting rightly or forbidding wrongly. My child crying with hunger I see as grounds for feeding her. My son playing too roughly with my daughter I see as grounds for removing him from the room, even though his tears of protest match or equal her tears of pain. My memory that I promised to read a student's paper before Friday strikes me as grounds for staying up a little later to read it, despite feeling ready for bed. Foot says we "shouldn't be allowed to get away with a claim to 'just see' that a reason exists" [@foot2003n 58] There are different kinds of "shoulds." One "should" go to the bank to prevent an overdraft and one "should" stay home recovering from the flu.  These shoulds are relative to the circumstances. There is also a should "all things considered." This second kind of should we can say is not relative to the circumstances, or we can equally say it is relative to the fixed set of all the circumstances. In one context, the fact that a man is my father may be reason to take care of him in old age; but in another context it is not reason giving. 

If we have considered context and all extenuation circumstances, it is possible that certain facts are reason giving full stop. If we have considered all things, we can utter an "overriding or final 'should'". For instance, suppose I'm leaning toward grading the student's paper. I think, *well, I promised to do it, and though I am sleepy, there are no extenuating circumstances that make it unwise for me to lose a little sleep. I can sleep in, or catch a nap, tomorrow, and no one's life depends on my being especially alert, and I'm not out of coffee grounds, etc.* All things considered, I ought to go ahead and grade the student's paper. 

Foot thinks that to not do what I *should do all things considered* is irrational. 

She doesn't think that morality is just a system of hypothetical imperatives, though she argued it an in earlier essay.[@foot1972morality] The truth behind her error was that desires and interests are always intimately related with our actions and motivations. That is, desires *may* be reason giving. "A desire to see the Taj Mahal can in the right circumstances make it rational to plan a trip to India and visit a travel agent; and similarly the knowledge that cigarettes are carcinogenic can rationalize giving up smoking by showing that it is in one's interest to do so." [@foot2007n 61] But they are not *always and necessarily* the only reason giving reasons for action. 

And this is the mistake with which she is less patient:  the dogmatic belief that desires simply must always necessarily be the "real" reasons behind action. She bluntly asserts a plurality of fundamental motives and challenges the philosophical dogma to defend itself against those ostensive facts. She presents "all sorts of causes" that might explain an action: habits, imitation, nostalgia, ritualistic symbolism, and conscience. 

&gt;What tells us that conscience cannot explain action? Someone may give as the explanation of his action a thought about right and wrong, and it may be a true explanation, as Kropotkin clearly supposed in his story of Maklay's decision not to photograph his sleeping servant. So offhand we have no reason to suppose that acting as conscience demands has to be brought into a special mould, as of a belief and a ‘conative state’, before we can see it as a genuine explanation of what someone does. If we like, we can say that someone whose action is explained in this way is ‘wanting to do what is right’; but now we are simply expressing the agent's intention in terms of wanting, not showing the explanation as fitting a favoured mould.[@foot2007n 61-62] 

I find this reasoning persuasive. 

Foot details an article from Warren Quinn to the effect that the concept of rationality includes an evaluative aspect, namely that it aims at the good. 

This fits with what we have sketched in our normatively realist virtue ethical framework. Practical reason just *is* that faculty that aims at the good. 
	
Foot summarizes: 
&gt;Earlier in the book, in Chapters 1–3, I gave reasons for believing propositions about natural goodness and badness in various plants, animals, and human beings; for instance, for believing that an individual oak tree with superficial, spindly roots was to be evaluated as defective, and, passing to human beings, gave reasons of the same form for the assertion that Maklay would have acted badly had he photographed his sleeping servant.

What must a good person do? A person acting rationally is acting well and acting well is acting rationally. To ask for a *reason* why one should act *rationally*, that is, *on reasons at all* is in some way to be confused or absurd. Jack asks for a reason why he should act on reasons because he is confused: he thinks at the moment that 'desire' is a reason for acting because it has motivational force "built in", and that any other 'reasons' for acting must be just abstract propositions with no motivational force. Jill asks for a reason to act on reasons because she is absurd: she sincerely affirms at the same time in the same respect that one ought to phi and one ought to not-phi. Jill we cannot help with arguments, but (perhaps) with therapy. Jack we cannot help with arguments, at least, not traditional arguments. He probably needs a good deal of Socratic questioning to allow him to think through what he really thinks. 


That the phenomenon happens I do not contest, though some may. But I wonder why. 

##Practical Reason

### Responses

“But the belief that the word ‘good’ must mean something different in the former and the latter is, I think, simply a prejudice coming from the type of ethical theory that has dominated analytic philosophy in the past half‐century” (Foot, Natural Goodness 39).[@foot2003n 39]

Foot here confuses one error with another. Certainly the belief that the word 'good' is special is _part_ of the prejudice of many 20th century analytic philosophers. That may be an error. But is it "simply" that prejudice? I think not. The other error in the vicinity is the belief that reality is bifurcated at its root into the normative and non-normative, or the ethical and everything else. Normative facts, on this error are just very different from all other facts. On the one hand, modal facts seem to be more akin to normative facts than other facts, since propositions describing modal facts describe states of affairs that nowhere obtain at the moment and may never obtain. "If heated up that rock must melt." And "Necessarily, each member of the human species will one day suffer biological death." The truth of these propositions, it may be argued, depends on our empirical observation. We, or rather some scientist, has observed of this or that rock at such-and-such a temperature, and we (most all of us) have observed human beings (in pictures or in life)die of old age, sickness, injury, violence, or accidents. But have we ever *observed* the modal fact that all humans *must* die? No, we infer it as a kind of nomological principle D, abstracted from a list of examples of human death. If I listed as a-z the (relatively few) deaths we have actually observed it would be a. This fellow died; b. My grandmother died, etc. Then add them to the (perhaps thousands) of deaths I have heard about from sources I trust. We still only have a sample of a few thousand. That tiny ratio (thousands of billions of currently living humans) of a sample is supposed to justify a principle D that ranges over all possible human beings, past, present, and into the unlimited future, and even fictional characters. My point is not to challenge the inference; it seems as true and well-founded as an inductive inference can be. My point is that the proposition with a modal operator D is different from the propositions a-z without.  And D seems to me appropriately described as a *fact*. 

Even so, if you find moral facts bizarre, then modal facts and other normative facts are liable to seem equally bizarre, or similarly bizarre for the identical reasons. They are just too different from other facts. 

Another error is the thought that properly basic beliefs are not justified unless we can justify them by non-basic methods, as when some physicists deny the solidity of a brick because they know it's "not really" solid. But our account of subvenient things like atoms and molecules can and should explain our knowledge of supervenient things like solidity.  

The bottom line for Foot's naturalism is that it is true but not complete. To go part of the way is not the same as to go the wrong way, but it is still not sufficient. "For to say that [human operations  ""could be evaluated in the same way as...plants"] is possible is to imply that some at least of our judgements of goodness and badness in human beings are given truth or falsity by the conditions of human life."[@foot2003n 38] And this implication is correct, she defends. Natural normativity governs plants and animals and humans in the same way. All have function and all can achieve or fail to achieve that function. A pattern of life is indexed to each species; its good is specified and the defects by contrast to those qualities conducive to its good.

Each member of the species lives out a particular life in a context or environment. Even if it has species-specific "virtues" it may fail to survive or reproduce. She mentions that a swift deer as well as slow can run into the hunter's trap. 

Is the human good reproduction? Stephen Brown all but says yes. But the objection is that people who willfully avoid reproduction to not seem to us to be ipso facto defective. Sterile couples who wish to procreate but cannot rightly lament, for reproductive difficulties are tragic. But bachelors, celibates, homosexuals, who might but do not wish to procreate might seem to us not only normal but even exemplary in their self-control and devotion to their mission or calling. All this Foot can accommodate. She says "the teleological story goes beyond a reference to survival itself." [@foot2003v, @foot2003n ]

I hesitate to play the ultimatum game and say that this is a sine qua non of human rationality. But I cannot understand those who look at all of human life, our forms of life, our elaborate way of hunting, cooking, eating, and storing our food, our elaborate way of building structures for ourselves, our scientific journals, our space program, our international trades and laws, our arts, music, poetry, dance, and theater, and all the helter-skelter that makes human civilization buzz -- I cannot understand, I say, someone who can keep all this in view and countenance the thought that "all this is just so we can survive." 

The reason I find it so obvious that all of human activity is for *happiness* and not merely survival is that survival is a necessary but not sufficient condition for all or most of our intentional actions. 

Some things have no survival value but give value to survival. We survive *for the sake*  of thriving, we don't thrive for the sake of surviving. 

The thought that "well, despite appearances, survival is the telos of all living things" if true, would guarantee that "all intentional human activity is for the sake of survival". But surely if the evidence suggests that we deny the consequent, then rationality demands a denial of the antecedent. If the antecedent is above rational scrutiny, if it is nonfalsifiable, then what we have is not a rational conclusion but an irrational dogma. 

One whose dogmatic belief in Darwinian explanations does not allow them to see the plain facts cannot claim to be more rational. They must cling to their mantra, and trust in the magical ability of propositions from neo-Darwinian theory like "survival is the only goal of biology" to help theory triumph over common sense. One small slip up and they could see the truth.

            <Text>	1.	## Chapter Introduction ##
	2.	In this chapter, we turn our attention to Philippa Foot. Philippa Foot is a widely celebrated and idiosyncratic author. Her writings have been influential but often misunderstood. She does not — and proudly does not — conform to some of the pervasive expectations on analytic philosophers (and especially ethicists). This non-conformity both frees her from common prejudices and subjects her to uncommon misunderstandings. 
	3.	Her main thesis in “natural goodness” is similarly teleological: ‘goodness’ is a functional concept and applies (at least) to all *living natural* entities. “Natural goodness” for her does not refer to “natural law.”[@foot2001natural chapter 1] Foot’s contribution to an adequate foundation of virtue will be to render this account more plausible and to extend it by insightful reflection on moral language. Foot’s Natural Goodness (among other) also affords us an opportunity to revisit the assumptions of G.E. Moore and the Principia Ethica, criticizing them from a different angle than MacIntyre. 
	4.	In the last chapter, we saw that teleology — at least social teleology —  is essential to ethics. Teleology is also a best “fit” for virtue ethics rather than modern rationalistic Kantian and utilitarian theories that make *duties themselves* or the external, contingent *consequences of actions* play the definitive role. Teleology may or may not be “natural” more broadly (inherent to the cosmos as a whole or inherent to all living things) but it is intrinsic to *human practices*. And, human practices, are *human*. We are practical creatures by nature. We’ve called this practicality and the claim that such practicality is end-directed or teleological “social teleology.”

            <Text>### How I deal with Objections

One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocutors, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproariously funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocutors are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergraduates are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. 

Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to “let the dead bury the dead.” 

While writing a platonic dialogue is a form of art I still find appealing and still use, that is not the best vehicle for this dissertation. So I am forced to give the views I think mistaken the best hearing I can give them in my own voice. 

The challenge of metaethical inquiry, I think, is to engage readers who do not already agree with you. A constant danger to which we are all liable is assuming too many crucial propositions and arguing at length about a bunch of relatively peripheral propositions. Metaethicists who steer clear of this danger are the likes of Alan Gibbard and Robert Adams. There is some value to articulating, clarifying, and defending a view that reader and author both (already) share. But that is not the valuable enterprise I aim for. 

The test, I think, shall be whether these pages find readers who disagree with the core thesis I present, and if such can recognize "their own" purported view in the pages that follow. If they can not only recognize but resoundingly affirm the view expressed in that chapter, then my objections may have some bite and may earn the high honor of receiving a rebuttal. 

It would not be a failure if no one found these pages; most such essays do not find readers, even if they deserve them. Failure would be for some ethical naturalist to pick up the book or a chapter on a shelf or online, glance at the view expressed, and to disown what I claim is his own.

            <Title>Section I: Adams</Title>
            <Text>Adams’ theory of virtue builds, in some ways, on his metaethical theory in Finite and Infinite Goods. 

For Adams, to be virtuous is to be for the good. ‘Being for’ is to be understood as a dispositional attitude, a stance, a direction, an overall disposition. But one can fail to be for the good in the proper way. Hence, to be virtuous is to be excellent in being for the good. 

Adams criticizes but builds upon the views of Thomas Hurka (2001 %). For Hurka, virtues are higher-level intrinsic goods involving morally appropriate attitudes to other (independent) goods or evils. Hurka is a virtue consequentialist. He notes that on one view virtue is a “disposition to produce what is otherwise good or to do what is otherwise right” (call these primary goods) in which case virtue is of only “derivative and instrumental significance.” (2001, 3%). On the contrary view, however, virtue is itself a primary good. On such a view, good and right are goods only derivatively.  Hurka’s account is “intermediate between these extremes” (2001, 3 %). Hurka’s account is not a rival to consequentialism but “satisfies consequentialist assumptions” while giving an account of the intrinsic goodness of virtue and intrinsic badness of vice (2001, 4).

            <Text>##Kant's critique of empirical ethics
We ought not dwell for long on Kant's metaethical project, but his critique of "empirical ethics" is helpful to my purpose. 



Kant’s Teleology

12. Teleology or Deontology?
“The received view is that Kant's moral philosophy is a deontological normative theory at least to this extent: it denies that right and wrong are in some way or other functions of goodness or badness. It denies, in other words, the central claim of teleological moral views. For instance, act consequentialism is one sort of teleological theory. It asserts that the right action is that action of all the alternatives available to the agent that has the best overall outcome. Here, the goodness of the outcome determines the rightness of an action. Another sort of teleological theory might focus instead on character traits. 'Virtue ethics' asserts that a right action in any given circumstance is that action a virtuous person does or would perform in those circumstances. In this case, it is the goodness of the character of the person who does or would perform it that determines the rightness of an action. In both cases, as it were, the source or ground of rightness is goodness. And Kant's own views have typically been classified as deontological precisely because they have seemed to reverse this priority and deny just what such theories assert. Rightness, on the standard reading of Kant, is not grounded in the value of outcomes or character.

There are several reasons why readers have thought that Kant denies the teleological thesis. First, he makes a plethora of statements about outcomes and character traits that appear to imply an outright rejection of both forms of teleology. For instance, in Groundwork I, he says that he takes himself to have argued that “the objectives we may have in acting, and also our actions' effects considered as ends and what motivates our volition, can give to actions no unconditional or moral worth…[this] can be found nowhere but in the principle of the will, irrespective of the ends that can be brought about by such action” (4: 400). This appears to say that moral rightness is not a function of the value of intended or actual outcomes. Kant subsequently says that a categorical imperative “declares an action to be objectively necessary of itself without reference to any purpose—that is, even without any further end” (4:415). A categorical imperative “commands a certain line of conduct directly, without assuming or being conditional on any further goal to be reached by that conduct” (4:416). These certainly appear to be the words of someone who rejects the idea that what makes actions right is primarily their relationship to what good may come of those actions, someone who rejects outright the act consequentialist form of teleology. Moreover, Kant begins the Groundwork by noting that character traits such as the traditional virtues of courage, resolution, moderation, self-control, or a sympathetic cast of mind possess no unconditional, moral worth, (4:393-94, 398-99). If the moral rightness of an action is grounded in the value of the character traits of the person who performs or would perform it, then it seems Kant thinks that it would be grounded in something of only conditional value. This certainly would not comport well with the virtue ethics form of teleology.

Second, there are, deeper theoretical claims and arguments of Kant's in both the Groundwork and in the second Critique that appear to be incompatible with any sort of teleological form of ethics. These claims and arguments all stem from Kant's insistence that morality is grounded in the autonomy of a rational will. For instance, Kant states that “if the will seeks the law that is to determine it anywhere else than in the fitness of its maxims for its own giving of universal law…heteronomy always results” (4:441) If the law determining right and wrong is grounded in either the value of outcomes or the value of the character of the agent, it seems it will not be found in the fitness of the action's maxim to be a universal law laid down by the agent's own rational will. And Kant's most complete treatment of value, the second Critique's “On the Concept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason”, appears to be a relentless attack on any sort of teleological moral theory. “The concept of good and evil” he states, “must not be determined before the moral law (for which, as it would seem, this concept would have to be made the basis) but only (as was done here) after it and by means of it” (5:63).

A number of Kant's readers have come to question this received view, however. Perhaps the first philosopher to suggest a teleological reading was John Stuart Mill. In the first chapter of his Utilitarianism, Mill implies that the Universal Law formulation of the Categorical Imperative could only sensibly be interpreted as a test of the consequences of universal adoption of a maxim. Several 20th century theorists have followed Mill's suggestion, most notably, R. M. Hare. Hare argued that moral judgments such as “Stealing is wrong” are in fact universal prescriptions (“No stealing anywhere by anyone!”) And because they are universal, Hare argued, they forbid making exceptions. That in turn requires moral judgments to give each person's wellbeing, including our own, equal weight. And when we give each person's wellbeing equal weight, we are acting to produce the best overall outcome. Thus, in his view, the CI is “simply utilitarianism put into other words” (Hare, 1993, p. 103). More recently, David Cummiskey (Cummiskey, 1996) has argued that Kant's view that moral principles are justified because they are universalizable is compatible with those principle themselves being consequentialist. Indeed, Cummiskey argues that they must be: respect for the value of Humanity entails treating the interests of each as counting for one and one only, and hence for always acting to produce the best overall outcome.

There are also teleological readings of Kant's ethics that are non-consequentialist. Barbara Herman has urged philosophers to “leave deontology behind” as an understanding of Kant's moral theory on the grounds that the conception of practical reason grounding the Categorical Imperative is itself a conception of value. Herman's idea is that Kant never meant to say that no value grounds moral principles. That, she argues, would imply that there would be no reason to conform to them. Instead, Kant thought the principles of rationality taken together constitute rational agency, and rational agency so constituted itself functions as a value that justifies moral action. (1993, 231) Herman's proposal thus has Kant's view grounding the rightness of actions in rational agency, and then in turn offering rational agency itself up as a value. Both Paul Guyer and Allen Wood have offered proposals that differ from Herman's in content, but agree on the general form of teleology that she defends as a reading of Kant. Guyer argues that autonomy itself is the value grounding moral requirements. Moral thinking consists in recognizing the priceless value of a rational agent's autonomous will, something in light of whose value it is necessary for any rational agent to modify his behavior (1998, 22-35). And Wood argues that humanity itself is the grounding value for Kant. While the second Critique claims that good things owe their value to being the objects of the choices of rational agents, they could not, in his view, acquire any value at all if the source of that value, rational agency, itself had no value. (1999, 130; see also pp. 157-8) Finally, Rae Langton has recently argued that if Kant's theory is to be thought of as an objectivistic view, we must suppose that the value of humanity and the good will are independent of simply being the objects of our rational choices. If their value thereby becomes the source of the rightness of our actions — say, our actions are right if and because they treat that self-standing value in various ways — then her reading too is teleological.

It is of considerable interest to those who follow Kant to determine which reading — teleological or deontological — was actually Kant's, as well as which view ought to have been his. A powerful argument for the teleological reading is the motivation for Herman's proposal: What rationale can we provide for doing our duty at all if we don't appeal to it's being good to do it? But a powerful argument for the deontological reading is Kant's own apparent insistence that the authority of moral demands must come simply from their being the demands of each person's own rational will, quite apart from the value that will may have. (see Schneewind, 1996, Johnson, 2007, 2008, also Reath, 1994) On the latter view, moral demands gain their authority simply because you yourself have, insofar as you are rational, willed them. Proponents of this reading are left with the burden of answering Herman's challenge to provide a rationale for having willed it. On the former view, by contrast, a rationale is at hand: because your will is, insofar as it is rational, good. Proponents of this former reading are then left with the burden of explaining how it could be the autonomy of the will alone that explains the authority of morality.” (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/)

MacIntyre’s thesis is that Kant and Mill were also ultimately emotivist (or expressivists). They mask Nietzschean self-will in the trappings of objectivity, rationality, and moral probity. The conclusion that Kant gives as a rationale for moral demands simply the fact that I myself have willed them fits MacIntyre’s thesis perfectly.

Overview:
Synopsis:
Reflections:
“A child is born. It is immediately immersed in sensation and greeted with discomfort. It is relieved by fondling and feeding. It experiences touch and taste, hearing and sight, scent and movement. The earliest sensations are doubtless blurry. But soon, discrimination begins. This is a differential responsiveness to experiences. The child reaches out for milk, smiles at Mama, cries from loud noises.
It is not clear when the first beliefs are formed. Their formation is facilitated by discrimination, but belief-formation is not entailed by discrimination. Belief requires understanding. Whereof one cannot understand, thereof one cannot believe. Understanding, in turn, requires concepts. Concepts arise in interlocking formations. Beliefs do not arise in isolation either, one doxastic atom at a time. Like concepts, they are formed, and work, in families.
We are blessed not only with a receptiveness to learning from experience but also with a capacity to learn from what we already know. One route to learning is generalization: if a small yelping dog jumps at a child, the child expects much the same of a big one. Another, overlapping, route to learning is inference. Inference, too, appears early in life. We infer certain consequences of some of the things we believe. A child told that the family cannot have animals needs no logical prowess to infer that the puppy offered by neighbors will not be accepted. We also make inferences to the best explanation. The same child may infer from canine squeals at the door that the puppy is outside.” (Robert Audi, Rationality and the Good, p. 3).

This paper aims to clarify some of the terms and concepts in the metaethical debate between naturalists and non-naturalists, and in the broader (metaphysical and metaphilosophical) debate between naturalists and theists. I believe a confusion has arisen that causes many otherwise good arguments to run afoul of a critical ambiguity. 

The confusion has to do with normativity and rationality and morality. 


I will begin by explaining the way the target sorts of debates typically fall out. Then I shall go back to the drawing board to clean up some definitions of terms by reviewing their historical uses as well as analyzing the relevant concepts in play. Finally, I shall return to the first-order debates to see how the target debates are affected by the cleaned up and clarified definitions — if indeed the definitions are superior. </Text>

            <Text>## Aristotelian Nature Telos Chapter 
Discussions of putatively "Aristotelian" or neo-Aristotelian elynchthics self-consciously import some Aristotelian metaphysics. But how much? The linchpin is Aristotle's notion of telos.

Aristotle's metaphysics can be characterized around a few broad themes: 
1. Form and matter;
2. Actuality and potentiality;
3. Causation: final, formal, efficient, and material; 
4. Substance and nine types of property; 

Of course, his epistemology cottons on to his metaphysics. To know X is to actualize the mind with respect to the form of X; to know X is to be informed by X. Knowledge is the telos of intellect or %νους. The intellect that is being actualized by the actualities/forms of objects in the world is itself an object of the world. The intellect being actualized is fulfilling its nature (its form). Fulfilling a nature means realizing a telos inherent or coordinate with the form. 

### Telos

Some philosophers talk of telos as if it were a separable portion of Aristotle's unified metaphysics. I am not so sure.  [^5]

[^5]: I am thinking of people like Canadian metaphysician Kathrin Koslicki who said during the Q&amp;A of a talk that telos had been "surgically removed" from her hylomorphic metaphysics. "A Hylomorphic Analysis of Concrete Particular Objects" But surgical removal of an essential organ kills the patient. 

Metaphysically, the reason telos is the linchpin is that without telos, formal structure does not exhaustively account for an organism. A very old book on biology argues that biologists are often split between form based and function based biologies, between anatomy or physiology [@russell1916]. For Aristotle, such debates are needless. Formal cause and final cause together (with material and efficient of course) constitute an organism's true identity. 

Epistemically, knowing the form of x without knowing the telos of x is a good start but only part of the way to knowledge of x.</Text>

            <Title>## History and Tradition</Title>
            <Text>### MacIntyre's history and project ###

My goal in this chapter is to present, analyze, and defend MacIntyre's theory of virtue and practical rationality. However, because of his emphasis on history and narrative, it would be wise to view MacIntyre's theory in light of his intellectual biography. This will introduce two major themes: history and tradition. 

MacIntyre grew up inside two cultures: a rustic Scottish fishing culture and an elite Scottish intellectual culture. For this reason, in part, his theory emphasizes the importance of being able to understand multiple cultures. He attended Epsom College at age sixteen where he was tutored by R. G. Collinwood. He acquired an interest in ethics during undergraduate study and wrote his M.A. thesis critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. But the trouble he found with emotivism was also the trouble with other modern moral philosophies. 

One of MacIntyre’s enduring themes is that we all inhabit a tradition. His critique of modernity is a critique of a tradition, and his eventual solution is the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Yet the concept is liable to fatal misunderstanding. I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain 'tradition' at the outset. What does it mean to assert that “we all inhabit a tradition”? Most trivially, it means each of us are embodied, live in a time, place, and social setting, and speak a given language. More interestingly, it means that each of us (intellectuals at least) owe our conceptual resources to a tradition. What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222]. The content of a tradition is partly self-reflexive: it is "… an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition." Traditions derive from a source text and continue across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Torah) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how best to interpret and apply the Torah, the whole Tanakh, the Talmud, and later commentaries. Also history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, Thucydides, and Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to conduct historical enquiry. 

Even if this notion of tradition is clear (I shall discuss it much more below), some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, Enlightenment modernity, or simply modernity. It is not politically left-leaning or liberal in the contemporary sense but includes right-leaning conservatives as well. For simplicity, in most instances I shall simply use the term ‘modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

MacIntyre’s most thorough treatment of the theme of how traditions conduct moral enquiry is the (1990) Gifford Lectures. There he presents three “rival versions of moral enquiry.” They are ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and a third version he simply calls ‘tradition’ but I will call ‘Thomism.’ The three rivals are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. For example, genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, but Freud and Marx count as well. Stephen Lutz says: 

&gt;The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.[@lutz2015]

By contrast, encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think we have *arrived*. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica*, about which one reviewer said:

&gt;The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy and the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms.

Another exemplary encyclopedist is Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. 

MacIntyre's conviction is that we, even we anti-traditional moderns, inhabit a tradition. Yet we are not trapped by it. Members of a tradition are able to discover the inadequacies of their tradition and discover the resources of a rival tradition. This is just what happened to him. How did MacIntyre “deconvert” from modernism? It began with ethics. What troubled him about emotivism in particular and modern metaethics in general was an assumption shared by emotivists, intuitionists, naturalists, and error theorists that moral terms are *referential.* If moral terms within moral judgments are supposed to pick out a property in the world, then either we must identify that property or (if we cannot) conclude that moral terms are literally meaningless. He argued that this assumption is a mistake. Instead, he concluded that the significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Instead of referring (or failing to refer) to a special 'moral property', all evaluative reasoning is practical reasoning. We employ moral judgments when we must evaluate something or when we must reason about what to do. Moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. Hence, there can be no adequate theory of ethics apart from a theory of (practical) rationality. 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. It was the tradition MacIntyre was raised in. It is the tradition I was raised in, as (I presume) were my readers. So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is an argument extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and parts of western Europe. Modernity has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reforming civil law; Kant wrote the three *Critiques* but also the *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. 

As a member of the modern tradition, he gradually discovered its inadequacies. His attempt to trace the root of the mistake about moral judgments lead him to a mistake at the heart of Enlightenment modernity. As a social, political, and moral project, the Enlightenment has been, MacIntyre argues, a failure by its own standards. One of his most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe...Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance... all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. But an obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. Neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity. An explanation of this disagreement is that we are trying to get by using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry, like genealogy, incoherent by its own standards. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three]  The problem with modernity is not merely academic. The social and political fabric is woven from the thread of morality, so many of the ills of modern life can be traced to our inability to share a substantive conception of the good and the good life.  

There are many modern philosophers who have gone into similar crises. The become critics of the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity. Such become distrustful thought, language, and rationality itself; they become "the masters of suspicion."[@ricoeur1970freud. "Three masters, seemingly mutually exclusive, dominate the school of suspicion: Marx, Nietzche, and Freud." "]  MacIntyre took a surprising course. His crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover a more adequate answer to some philosophical problem. His criticisms lead him to find an older and still vital foundation amidst the ruins. It is upon this foundation -- the Aristotelian tradition of virtue -- that MacIntyre continues to build.

The story of his avoidance of despair and deconstructionism is an interesting one. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences.[@kuhn1975structure] What if a similar structure obtained in scientific revolutions and in moral revolutions? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn's (and Feyerabend’s) analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful."[@feyerabend1993against] He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack. Kuhn's concept of a paradigm is a nice analogue for MacIntyre's concept of a tradition.

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a specific, living, moral tradition -- the Aristotelian tradition. This is one of MacIntyre's recurring themes: ethical concepts have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical terms and concepts when we have some historical perspective on them. Furthermore, *we* have a history. Practical concepts such as the self, practice, the *telos* or end of life, and virtue are all  MacIntyre realized that we all inhabit a tradition -- even putatively anti-traditionalist moderns. So we must know ourselves as members of a tradition, as members of a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. These themes -- tradition have guided the construction of MacIntyre's virtue theory. 


These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.  

But it is worth saying at the outset that MacIntyre readers fall into two broad camps: those who are, on the whole, more critical of modernity, and those who, on the whole, are less critical of modernity. The former group tend to find MacIntyre's diagnosis compelling and his solutions exhilarating.  Restoring historical perspective on ethics, restoring ethical reasoning to its place within practical reasoning, and restoring *telos* promises to make available the resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The hope of a restored morality brings with it the hope of a restoration of social and political integrity. MacIntyre invites such readers to see the point of education, politics, and social life once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, to restore an intelligibility to these activities and pursuits that many of us moderns can hardly imagine. 

The latter group tend to find MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites such readers to reflect on themselves and on our common history. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modernity had these fatal flaws, would this solution be a good one?"</Text>

            <Title>### Practice ### </Title>
            <Text>### Practice ###

MacIntyre's 'practice' is a term of art. A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends.  Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, political activity, and several others as examples. Let’s look more closely at farming. Farming is a social activity undertaken let's say for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

A practice may be understood not as a mere action (like scratching an itch) but an intelligible set of actions embedded in a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is not just one action, but an intelligible set of actions (tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc.). 

The goods "internal" to farming are just those that necessarily constitute the practice as it is: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers produce comestibles, but I am speaking generally.) Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Virtues relative to the practice of farming include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Another and perhaps more clear example is one MacIntyre favors: political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the polis. But others (we need not speculate how many) engage in order to achieve “external” (unessential) goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power, or securing  book deals. Effectiveness in attaining these external goods does not constitute virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just any old sort of desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

Virtue defined by practice, then, is already importantly contrasted against mere *human happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. The standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal laws but immanent and flexible standards. The internal goal of farming is the production of edible food, and its practitioners qua farmers are committed to this goal without any eye toward the broader question of farming’s place in the broader social order. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. 

Even so, MacIntyre’s account of virtue eventually transcends this notion of practice. At least it transcends the narrowest definition of practice. His account of virtue includes three layers or dimensions: individual skill (like farming), social activity (like statesmanship), and human activity (like practical reasoning about how to live well). But it is essential to grasp the first layer. 

Lutz summarizes MacIntyre’s famous passage on virtue in this way: a practice is “(1) a complex social activity that (2) enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. (3) Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, (4) the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.”[@lutz2015]</Text>

            <Title>MacIntyre, Three Rival Versions</Title>
            <Text>MacIntyre begins Chapter 3 by identifying characteristics shared by both the encyclopaedic and genealogical modes in order to distinguish them from this third alternative. Both of the former modes see a unified history in philosophy from Socrates to the post-Kantians. From this it follows that both frame the question about the proper mode of moral enquiry in the form of an exclusive and exhaustive disjunction: either reason is detached from every particular tradition, or it is the instrument of a will to power (59). However, MacIntyre identifies a third possibility: perhaps rational enquiry requires that one participate in “a particular type of moral community” (60). Far from compromising rationality’s access to truth, MacIntyre suggests that participation in a tradition of moral practice and enquiry is a necessary condition for the right appropriation of rationality.

On MacIntyre’s view, then, moral inquiry is an ongoing conversation between conflicting approaches. Present debates grow out of reflection on the questions and answers offered by the best thinkers of the past.




(1) the lack of any generally accepted starting point for enquiry, (2) the lack of any generally accepted ranking in weight and importance of reasons for holding particular beliefs, and (3) the lack of resources provided by mere logical analysis for reasoning about the justification of substantive beliefs. Furthermore, these same three problems plague the larger world of contemporary philosophy such that only incommensurability seems able to explain the irreconcilable division and interminable disagreement. And where there is only incommensurability, it is difficult to see how there can be a history of rational progress.



MacIntyre claims that morality in Gifford’s culture was marked by five characteristics. First, morality was a distinct and relatively autonomous area of beliefs, attitudes, and rule following activity, ordered in accord with a scheme of rigid compartmentalization of life. Second, morality was primarily a matter of rule following and responding to rule breaking in ritualized ways. Third, the rules of morality were chiefly negative prohibitions. Fourth, strong impropriety attached to breaking the compartmentalization of social life: it was important to know which conversation to have with whom, and manners, clothing, euphemism and circumlocution safeguarded these practices. Fifth, morality was widely agreed to enjoin a certain set of actions and prohibitions, but, despite confidence that morality was somehow justifiable, there was large disagreement as to how it was actually justified.

Morality in 19th century Victorian England was
	•	Autonomous discipline of rule following
	•	About rule-following and rule-breaking
	•	Chiefly negative rules, prohibitions
	•	Lacking social skills was immoral
	•	“Everyone knows” that “morality” demands some actions and forbids others
	•	No one knows how “morality” is justified

            <Text>MacIntyre, After Virtue
	•	MacIntyre, Alasdair. After Virtue. Second Edition. Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1984 (1981).
	•	The foundation of his later work and the most important of his books to read. Includes his arguments about the failures of modern philosophy and politics and how those failures might be overcome, or at least diminished, with the help of the philosophy of Aristotle and the political way of life of the Greek city-state.

Preamble: 
After Virtue tells a story. The problem is not just that we moderns lack virtue; we lack an understanding of virtue combined with a partial understanding of several incomplete fragments of virtue. The solution is, first, to get perspective on the problem behind the problem.  The “problem behind the problem” is the Enlightenment abandonment of telos for individual human persons and whole human communities or political units all directed towards one shared human good, the personal and political virtues being in this frame the means to that telos. The solution to that is the personal and political restoration of a shared conception of a good — better yet, a shared recognition of the real good — and a realignment with the broadly Aristotelian tradition in cultivating the virtues that are by definition means to that telos. 

One sentence: 
Modern moralities are a mere simulacrum of morality, fragments of an older (largely Aristotelian/Christian) tradition of virtue. That tradition most broadly understood, with its practices and its awareness of the narrative unity of human life, is the only alternative that does not fold under the Nietzschean critique of emotivism, rational morality. 
Precis by Chapter: 
1.	A Disquieting Suggestion
Morality today is characterized by a complete lack of understanding of what morality is, what its guts are. The torn pieces of the one-whole garment are, each in isolation, unintelligible to each other and to themselves. 
2.	The Nature of Moral Disagreement Today
It is shrill as if no agreement or authority exists, yet loud as if agreement could be reached.
3.	Emotivism: Social Content and Social Context
Moore is just as much an emotivist or proto-emotivist as Mackie, just in a different way. He masks the inability to ground morality in intuitionism. Nietzsche will tear off that mask just as much as he will tear off the mask of Kant and the rationalists. 
4.	The Predecessor Culture and the Enlightenment Project of Justifying Morality

5.	Why the Enlightenment Project of Justifying Morality Had to Fail
It had to fail because it rejected telos, which of the three parts of morality (man as he is, man as he should be, and the practices man needs in order to become what we should) is the part that makes virtue intelligible. 
6.	Some Consequences of the Failure of the Project

7.	‘Fact’, Explanation and Expertise

8.	The Character of Generalizations in Social Science and their Lack of Predictive Power

9.	Nietzsche or Aristotle? 
Nietzsche exposes the Kantian and Utilitarian and contractarian attempts to ground goodness in rationality as false. So what’s left is emotivism (the will to persuade) or else Aristotelian virtue. 
10.	The Virtues of Heroic Societies
Homeric virtue was (a) social (indexed to roles) and also (b) nonmoral at least in our modern dilapidated sense of ‘moral,’ referring more to qualities of strength, cunning, prowess, etc. 
11.	The Virtues of Athens
Plato’s virtues, Sophoclese virtues. 
12.	Aristotle’s Account of the Virtues
Aristotle is missing an awareness of tragedy, of fundamentally insuperable forces acting on and against the good man despite his lack of flaws. 
13.	Medieval Aspects and Occasions
The medieval period deployed virtue (conceived as those qualities conducive to the common life of a community heading for the same telos) in the context of divine law. 

175 - Aristotle was improved on by the medievals in that the end of the narrative was of special importance. For Aristotle, virtue just is a certain kind of life. 
14.	The Nature of the Virtues
Is there any one conception of “virtue”? Is there anything that unites Jane Austin, St. Paul, Aristotle, and Benjamin Franklin? What about ‘acquisitiveness’? Humility? While the virtues are indexed to a society and a practice, there are common elements. A virtue exists in the “acceptance of some prior account of... social and moral life...” (186). The first stage invokes “practices”; the second “narrative order of human life” and the third “a moral tradition.”A practice is a complex social activity with internal goods, like farming, to which standards of excellence (defined by the practice) apply. The virtues are acquired qualities that enable the achievement of the goods of practices. (190). Practices require relationship between those who practice (191). Practices are not technical skills nor institutions. 
15.	The Virtues, the Unity of a Human Life and the Concept of a Tradition

16.	From the Virtues to Virtue and after Virtue
Jane Austen is the last bearer of the older tradition. 
17.	Justice as a Virtue: Changing Conceptions
Nozick’s and Rawls’ notions of justice are opposed, but share presuppositions, and are both opposed to the Arisotetelian tradition. Both do not consider desert (what is due) and reject reference to the past (249-51). 
18.	After Virtue: Nietzsche or Aristotle

Responses and Reflections
The book is divided into two movements. The first, from chps 1-8 tells the story of the problem, the “fall.” The second, chps 9-17 tells the story of the solution, “redemption,” looking back to go forward. Chp 9 is the cardinal chapter, in my view, the hinge on which the book turns. 

Chapter 9 is “Nietzsche or Aristotle?” and poses two rivals, the Aristotelian tradition (of virtue) as against the Enlightenment tradition (of morality justified by rationality rather than virtue), where Nietzsche is a sort of Tazmanian devil storming into the rivalry to destroy the Enlightenment tradition — or rather, to unmask is as emotivism: the habit of imposing one’s personal feelings on others by force, of manipulation and compulsion. Kant (et. al.,) provide the antecedent, but Nietzsche shoves our noses in a consequent that provides a reductio ad absurdum for Kant (et. al.). The only remaining option, then, is Aristotle, and virtue. 

I find MacIntyre’s mythologizing fascinating. He is telling stories. The key to this book is the narrative unity of the human life chapter, where he says human beings are story-tellers.

            <Text>narrative life

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single *telos* governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of *telos*). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and *telos* comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a *telos*, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our *telos*. 

MacIntyre says: 

&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of *telos* as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their *telos*, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not obviously a eudaimonist. He seems to be saying that our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. But this is not quite correct. </Text>

            <Text>

The labor of the essays comprising this dissertation has been to defend the claim that human virtue is not (merely) a part of nature, and that virtuous humans are not (merely) part of nature, if by nature we mean the non-living or the living non-human parts of existence. 
It has not been my task to defend the claim that virtue is real. Moral nihilism or radical skepticism are still viable “outs” from this conclusion for those who want to avoid it but who are persuaded by the dilemma. In this chapter I would like to very briefly address the anti-realist or nihilist option. Building off the moral realist arguments from Shaffer-Landau, Thomas Nagel, Philippa Foot, and more, I defend the claim that the best understanding of the facts of our moral thinking and the best explanation of our moral behavior are the realist understanding and explanation. Other explanations are so obviously false that they can only be tenable in light of the threatening consequences of becoming a realist. Other explanations are not soothing, comforting — they bring us face to face with the “horror of the normative.”
Philippa Foot concludes Natural Goodness with an essay on Nietzsche and moral skepticism. Is skepticism a rational possibility? 

###Draft 2
The labor of these chapters has been to defend the claim that virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is the most adequate explanation we have of a non-trivial set of explananda that puzzle us when we reflect on life as lived, and that the question of whether such a theory is ‘naturalistic’ is misguided. Ethical naturalism, depending on how one takes the term, is either inevitably going to succeed or inevitably doomed to failure. Such a range of intension is not philosophically tolerable. Rather, I have argued, the unambiguous and meaningful question is whether we must opt for a theistic ethical naturalism or an atheistic ethical naturalism.

            <Text>We are training to explain our normativity. We are trying to explain our sensitivity to reasons, both epistemic and moral, though I will try to expand on the term ‘moral’ in a moment. A metaethical theory that gets the way we actually talk and think dramatically wrong must be wrong. A metaethical theory that gets them right might still be wrong, but is on the right track. 

Evaluative Discourse
Evaluative discourse is ubiquitous. I can hardly open my mouth to greet a colleague or chat with my toddler without evaluating something. I might praise the weather to a colleague or imprecate the volume of my toddler’s voice (if his sister is napping). We do not just make judgments of a positive moral character about (say) the latest hero who saved a child or judgments of a negative moral character about say, the latest ISIS atrocity. We praise and blame, approve and disapprove, glorify and denigrate philosophers or scientists  whose work demonstrates exemplary integrity or superlative intellectual dishonesty. We critically evaluate politicians and other public leaders in their actions or lack thereof — and we evaluate the evaluations of others. 

Just the word ‘good’? 
The way some metaethicists talk you would think the only goal is to explain the semantics and pragmatics of our use of the English word ‘good’ and that’s the end of it. 
This myopeia is partly this is due, I think, to Moore’s prefatory statement in Principia Ethica that the primary goal of ethics is to explain why we call things good when we call them good. 
Also, good is specific enough that we actually do use it in everyday speech (we speak of our “good students”) and in philosophical discourse (Plato’s form of the good, Kant’s good will) while remaining general enough to represent simply the “positive” or “up” side of evaluative discourse about anything.
But restricting metaethical inquiry to investigating our use of that one term is a mistake. To reduce all the ways in which our life is dappled with judgments of value, pursuit of what is worthy, avoidance of what is base or trivial to ‘evaluative discourse’ is a mistake. Surely, we want to explain value talk. But we also want to explain the things we talk about evaluatively. To me it seems a laughable mistake. It is as if a metabiologist thought she could assert something meaningful and interesting about giraffes, hippopotami, bacteria, humans, sea slugs, and pterodactyls by explaining ‘life talk.’  Surely there is something interesting going on when we use the same word (‘alive’ or ‘living’) about such a diverse set of creatures but don’t use it about crystals, solar systems, or the wind. But to ignore all the particularities of different life forms in their highly various manifestation is to ignore all the particularities and varieties of ‘life talk.’ 

Not not all human goodness is moral goodness
Another reason to think metaethical inquiry is indistinguishable from metanormative inquiry as a whole. We need to be able to explain more than evaluations commonly labeled as ‘moral’. For example, we should want an explanation for why we think stupidity is bad even if it is not morally bad. 
For these reasons, metaethical inquiry is part and parcel of a global metanormative theory that seeks to explain all kinds of evaluations, evaluative judgments, evaluative discourse, and is sensitive to the variety of objects which we evaluate. 

The problem of agreement
There is another criterion that sets a limit on, and a research goal for, metaethical inquiry. I call this the Problem of Agreement. A metaethical theory should explain why humans so often and so globally agree on certain value judgments. It should explain moral platitudes entrenched in “folk morality” and why they seem so right even to sophisticates and intellectuals. I am thinking of platitudes like cruelty is wrong but also ones like friendship is valuable and family first.  Even if such platitudes turn out to be norm-expressions rather than propositional judgments, or truth-apt but not true, they had better turn out to be something very like the truth. Simon Blackburn is one who shoulders the burden of showing why, given that realism is basically wrong, realist talk is so ubiquitous. The problem of agreement should receive no shorter shrift than the so-called problem of disagreement, a phenomenon that underwrites far more wild interpretations than is justifiable.Cf. David Enoch, “How is Moral Disagreement a Problem for Realism?” % 

Criteria are falsifiable and hence negotiable
I do not wish to make my criteria seem non-negotiable. An argument could be made to show why what I have called a puzzling phenomenon is not so. Either the alleged phenomenon doesn’t happen or it’s just my idiosyncratic perspective that makes it puzzling.  I think these are negotiable but right. 

Why am I sometimes wrong? 
An example of a criterion that we might want to begin with but, upon reflection, should abandon: why am I always right and others always wrong? This is the kind of question many of us, if we are honest, have set about trying to answer at some point or another. A better criterion is that my ethical theory should explain why I am sometimes or even usually right, but why I can be mistaken. It should even, as a practical theory, or at least as a theory when applied, help me to identify mistakes and correct them. 
Or we might have asked: Why is my group right and others always wrong? (Michael Shermer’s Why People Believe Weird Things is an exercise in this kind of futility.) Also Nietzsche’s sardonic essay “Why I am so Wise”?) The question is not why are “they” wrong and “we” are right but given that we are mostly right, how might we be going wrong? Given that “they” are mostly wrong, how might they be getting it partially right? 

The Criteria for metanormative theory
The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are five. In brief, they are: the unity and diversity of ways things can be good; the unity and diversity of ways humans can be good; the way goods can be good for one or many humans; our occasional certainty about what is good; our mistakes about what is good; our amazing range of failures and successes in actually becoming good. 

The Post-Kantian Picture
This picture of objectivity of value, of moral facts consisting of a set of facts “in the world” to which our representational epistemic states can correspond or fail to correspond, and which make the truth of our evaluative propositions, is itself a picture of the world and our place in it that is subject to controversy (Rosen, “Objectivity and Modern Idealism”). Once you accept a picture of reality in which there is a mind/world gap, then you are obligated to overcome the gap or explain it away. I endorse this picture of the world, even if it seems to violate a tenet of naturalism that has become for Rosen “philosophical common sense”. The reasons for endorsing that picture will fill up many pages below. 

The Purport of Certainty 
Ethics is a less precise science than geometry. Aristotle said that we ought to be content with the degree of clarity afforded by the subject, since any more clarity would actually be less clear. To capture a fuzzy reality our account must be correspondingly fuzzy. To capture a fuzzy reality too clearly is to falsify the account. 
Descartes and Kant deplored the less-than-mathematical precision of philosophy (and hence ethics). They sought to make it either just as mathematically precise as geometry, astronomy, physics, logic, algebra or else deny it the honorific title of a science. 
Our metaethics must answer this question: should ethical inquiry be as precise as other forms of systematic, organized, theoretical knowledge? I do not think so, but I will not attempt a full defense here. Instead I will point to one phenomenon I take to be in need of explanation. 
Let it be given that ethics is more fuzzy and less precise than, say, physics or astronomy or archaeology. In this case, it makes sense that many of our evaluative judgments are tentative, probing, hypothetical, provisional. When I ask undergraduates whether they are for or against abortion, say, or for or against Obamacare, they often express bewilderment, aporia, a desire to learn the various reasonable positions, a sensitivity to objections and counterarguments, the provisional nature of their conclusions, the hypotheses they inherited from friends, family, or pastors. When I ask them whether they are going to go into a career or family life, into sciences or humanities, live near family or move away, they express uncertainty in no uncertain terms. This is as it should be. We are often (rightfully) unsure what is right and what is wrong, both personally and politically, both morally and prudentially. It takes time and many hours of deliberation to sort through what to do and what to believe.
Even so, there are some evaluative judgments about which we tend to be more certain than even factual judgments. And our metaethical theory should account for the fact. 
For instance, I am more certain that I ought to honor my father's memory than I am sure about his birthday (he was adopted and his parents memory agreed with one birth certificate but disagreed with another). I am more certain that the world is beautiful than that gluons (as conceived by present day physics) exist. I am more clear that I ought to care for my children than I am that Pluto is or is not a planet. I am more justified in believing that I ought to trust my wife’s fidelity when I am absent than I am justified in believing that most of the dinosaurs were eradicated by a catastrophe. All of my factual beliefs, in these cases, are open to more empirical evidence and new theorizing. But my evaluative beliefs, in these cases, are case closed.  
I will put it even more strongly. Cruelty is wrong, kindness is good — these are so true and so known to be true that I can hardly doubt them without ceasing to be myself.  To be open to reconsidering these platitudes constitutes a moral failing. 
I intentionally avoid controversial examples about which some people are so screachingly certain but about which others are equally certain about the opposite thesis. The point is not that certainty guarantees truth. The point is that some evaluations, as they seem to correspond to the objective facts, seem to be certainly right. So we ought to explain why we sometimes know what is true (that cruelty is bad) as well as the seeming knowledge of what the truth is about (the moral facts about kindness). So we must explain how and why some evaluative judgments purport to be known with an incorrigible certainty while others purport to be only guessed at, hoped for, glimpsed “through a glass darkly.”

The Four Explandanda
With these general considerations, I can give my explananda. For each explanandum I will give a bit more detail and a few examples of the kind of evaluative judgments I am thinking of, drawn from history, books, movies, my memory, or my own brain: 

	1)	Unity and Diversity of Goods. We do not just evaluative people as good; we evaluate everything that exists and even things that don’t exist (“the Joker is a great villain; Bespin is a beautiful city). We evaluate living things as living well or poorly. We evaluate inorganic systems. We predicate not just goodness (“moral” goodness) but order, harmony, truth, or beauty to inanimate things. Order and goodness are not identical but they are both “positive” or “up” values. So we must explain not only evaluative discourse about humans but about non-human objects (stars, rocks, forests), non-human animals (deer, dogs, buzzards), and systems (ecosystems, galaxies, molecules) according to normative canons other than moral ones. (Cf. (Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, Chapter 3 “Well-Being and Excellence”).  
Some examples:
	⁃	The stars are beautiful; the solar system is forming; Mt Shasta is beautiful when covered with snow; though hostile to us, the deep sea is a home (inorganic systems)
	⁃	The ecosystem is healthy; the beehive is flourishing; borax is bad for ants; the rainforest is being raped;  (living systems)
	⁃	The father and son are reconciling; their friendship has really lasted; she is rich; (human “non-moral” goods)
	⁃	It is rational to love truth; rational beings ought to proportion belief to the evidence; real scientists don't fabricate data; simultaneously to hold inconsistent beliefs makes one irrational; (human intellectual goods)
	⁃	Virtue is its own reward; “we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream”;  (human moral goods)
	2)	Unity and Diversity of Human Goods. 
	⁃	Not just “moral” but intellectual. We are judge ourselves and others on both our reason and practical reason. We judge our own and others thoughts and actions, beliefs and feelings. Practical reason gives reasons for practice — that is, it means there is such a thing as rational action. Without practical reason, we are left with impractical reason and irrational activity. But, as we clearly judge, we see both. Michael smith says, regarding practicality, "moral judgments seem to be, or imply, opinions about the reasons we have for behaving in certain ways and, other things being equal, having such opinions is a matter of finding ourselves with a corresponding motivation to act" (Smith 1994, 6-7). Now, Smith himself thinks these features are opposite each other. Beliefs  — correct or incorrect — about facts are "utterly distinct" from desires, and never the twain shall meet. But my point here is that practical rationality is broader than narrowly “moral” or even “ethical” concerns viewed as a set of absolute prohibitions or imperatives binding on all humans as such. 
	⁃	Sam is wise; Yuan is a good guy; those two may be cretins but they’re the smartest people in our department; parents ought to care for their children and children ought to respect their parents; friends ought to remain faithful even in times of sorrow and trouble; Jose was tempted but he did the right thing; Lindsay has earned it, I hope she enjoys the accolades; willfully to disregard the evidence for historical atrocities against people groups whom you happen to dislike is an intellectual and a moral error; ignoring evidence contradicting your hypothesis is an intellectual error; you are not a real scientist if you falsify evidence to support your hypothesis;  (evaluations of action and thought)
	⁃	Not just action, but character. I don’t want to prejudge how necessary virtue concepts are to explaining the way we actually think, but it seems to me a confirmable hypothesis that we judge ourselves and others on our character, habits, and overall way of life. We admire not only the good but the wise and look down on not only the wicked but the foolish. Furthermore, we judge ourselves and others as good, beautiful, faithful, friendly or the opposite of these, paradigmatically consists in judging not only their actions but especially their established character traits. A good person is one who has achieved a good set of character traits and employs or “activates” them habitually; a bad person is the opposite. The kind of person who earns our distrust is one who has proven reliably untrustworthy, who is reliably unreliable. 
	⁃	Pat did well… for once; what you did was wrong, but you’re not a bad person; Sam is wise those 9/11 firefighters were courageous; Cato is just. 
	⁃	Not just luck, but reaction. We hold ourselves and others accountable not for what luck has given them but for what we think, say, and do. We hold ourselves accountable, ultimately, for who we are insofar as that is a combination of what is out of our control (luck) as well as what is in our control. 
	⁃	It’s terrible what happened to Susan, but she’s bearing up rather well; Even with all that wealth and privilege, she’s managed to turn herself into a wretch; 
	⁃	Not just rational bipeds, but any rational being. Interestingly, we intuitively judge any hypothetical being the same way. We can judge the moral status of fictional villains like Galactus and the Joker or fictional heroes like Professor Xavier and Batman. Non-theists can judge whether a particular god as portrayed in literature or speech is admirable or not. If we ever discover extraterrestrial life say on Mars, we will not blame a bacterium for harming our astronauts nor praise one for curing terrestrial colds. If we discover or are discovered by extraterrestrial intelligence, however, we expect both to treat them with respect and to be treated with respect. If we ever meet with another intelligent life form — whether god, angel, or Alpha Centurion — we expect them to also obey the Golden Rule. The law of mutual respect or decency is not just a provincial terrestrial contract. 
	3)	Unity and diversity of human communities. I am not totally sure this is a separate criterion. But some goods we judge to be good relative to persons and others good for communities or groups (be they societies, cultures, peoples, nations, clubs, races, families, associations, or what have you). Sometimes these judgments are in tension, sometimes in harmony. 
	⁃	As a political animal, it is easier for me as an individual to flourish in a flourishing family, society, and state. 
	⁃	It is easier for my family, society, or state to flourish if I am flourishing as an individual.  
	⁃	Sometimes the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many: I ought to help my struggling first-generation college student to understand a concept even if the rest of the class already “gets it”. 
	⁃	Sometimes the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few: a majority vote in democratic society is sufficient to establish “the will of the people”, even if the minority are discontented. 
	⁃	Sometimes the general welfare is incompatible with my personal welfare, or at least my pleasure and comfort. Sometimes I ought to prefer the general welfare at my own expense (I ought to recycle plastics and papers even if it means buying another recycling can from the city) while other times I ought to prefer my welfare to the general welfare (when accepting a raise, I ought to use the money for my own purposes rather than donate all the extra to charity). 
	4)	Superlative Human Goodness (and badness). Some people are moral monsters, some people are saints. If our ethical theory does not account for this, then it is impoverished. Some people are not just decent but exceptionally admirable, heroically virtuous. Each of us has moral heroes, I believe, unless we are so deluded or so great that we believe ourselves morally superior to anyone we have yet come across. 

	⁃	That firefighter is paragon of courage; Sam is a sage; Jose should be elected Sheriff because he always does the right thing; Lindsay deserves every blessing she has. (I am carefully trying to break Godwin’s law.) John Maximovich is a saint; Mitchelle Blair (who allegedly murdered her children and stored them in a freezer) is a monster. 
	⁃	We must account for how some exemplary good people become so good, so benevolent, just, kind, caring, compassionate, powerful, joyful, and wise — and how some people become exemplary villains, examples of vice, debasement, wretchedness, and misery. 
	⁃	Some people are incredibly joyful. St. Francis of Assisi, G. K. Chesterton. They roar with laughter as often as they weep with sorrow. They do not walk through life but waltz through life. And they endorse this deep humor as the proper kind of attitude given the kind of universe we live in the creatures we are. Robert Puff is such a one. 
	⁃	Others do not walk through life, they plod to the nearest cliff and leap off of it. They end it. We must account for both suicides and martyrs. A religious bomber is not a martyr for he is not killed for his faith; he kills himself and others for his faith. He is but a religious murder-suicide. 

Are you just cherry-picking? 
Each of these needs alleged phenomena comment. Objections could be leveled against my choice of explananda to the effect that cherry-picking explananda is a way of fixing the race in favor of one or another future explanation. The worst academic sin I could commit early on would be to beg the question against a rival explanans merely by cherry-picking explananda. 

Examples from literature
To defend the first criterion, I have assembled a sort of sample from art, literature, reality television, anecdotal examples, history, and political discourse. The specimens of this sample are not, clearly, chosen at random. They were chosen with the criterion in mind. If my point were to show the features of a random sample, this sample would be a poor one. But that is not my point. Rather, I am to show *how easy* it is to gather examples of normative evaluations of various kinds deploying identical (English) terms for an apparent diversity of phenomena. </Text>

            <Title>### Virtue ethicist? ###</Title>
            <Text>### Virtue ethicist?  ###

Interestingly, though MacIntyre has contributed to contemporary virtue ethics and influenced many virtue ethicists, he denies the epithet himself. This is one reason his work is an excellent starting point for these chapters. If a coherent and intelligible and socially useful and personally enriching concept of virtue can be constructed within the confines of modern moral philosophy, then MacIntyre’s dire diagnosis is mistaken. If, however, his diagnosis is correct, then much of modern moral philosophy -- even modern virtue ethics -- has the same contagion. 

In a word, MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. Even though such a common vision of and pursuit of virtue is impossible to scale up indefinitely for 300+ millions people (in the U.S., for instance), it is possible and beneficial at smaller, local scales. And indeed, this is already happening. 

At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. I say "practical reason" rather than simply "ethics" or "morality" because his *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and "Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

In the following sections, I will attempt to trace in more detail his account of virtue and his account of how virtue and practical rationality are partially constituted by the traditions in which we live and move and have our being.

H1: If value is real, then it is natural. The crux of much metaethics today
1. It is real and not natural, so H is false. (Moore, Shaffer-Landeau) Deny the conditional
2. Value is real. Therefore it is natural. (Railton, Boyd) Affirm the antecedent
3. Value is not natural. Therefore it is not real. (Mackie, Ayer) Deny the consequent

H2: Morality, moral law, goodness, duty are known by practical reason. (Kant’s 2nd Critique)
1.	Either morality is practical rationality or practical irrationality. 
2.	If it is practical irrationality, then the good can only be known by mystical insight (nonnaturalism or supernaturalism, Moore). 
3.	The good cannot be known by mystical insight.
4.	So morality is practical rationality. 

1.	If morality is practical rationality, it is either pure or applied.
2.	If it is applied, then the good becomes confused with (identified with) pleasure. (naturalism or empiricism, Railton), and morality is an instrument for attaining the most pleasure.
3.	But the good is not identical to pleasure.
4.	So morality is not applied practical rationality. 
5.	So morality is pure practical rationality. 


1.	G.E. Moore
Moore is the first of a certain sort of ethical ‘nonnaturalist.’ An Englishman and one-time editor of Mind, he was a co-founder with Russell, Wittgenstein, and Frege of the analytic tradition. He studied Classics at at Trinity College in Oxford before Russell and J.M.E. McTaggart encouraged him to study philosophy as well, so his writings show familiarity and love of Plato and other ancients. In his Principia Ethica, he sets the terms for many of the issues in metaethics debated today. (His “Refutation of Idealism” and “Defence of Common Sense” and “Proof of the External World” advance clever ‘common sense’ or intuitive arguments against nonintuitive philosophical doctrine of idealism — the doctrines of McTaggart and F.H. Bradley.) In Principia Ethica, his primary contention is that goodness is an undefinable, intuitable, nonnatural property. It is undefinable in any other terms than goodness, least of all other ‘natural’ terms like pleasure or being. In order to refute attempts to define goodness as some other entity that is in nature or metaphysics, he spends considerable time discussing Mill, Hegel, and Plato. Goodness can however be known, like “yellowness”; it can be intuited. Goodness can only be shown and grasped, not defined. We can intuit intrinsic goodness and know that it is worth producing or bringing about, and this knowing is apart from proof or disproof. Knowing goodness is not of a kind with empirical knowledge of sensibles nor metaphysical knowledge of ‘truths of reason.’ Ethics, then, is an autonomous discipline that does not owe its first principles to natural science nor metaphysics. Moore is also a certain sort of consequentialist, since he thinks that whatever actions bring about beauty and awareness of beauty (which are intrinsically preferable or worth bringing about) are worth doing. The best action produces the best outcome. Since predicting the best outcome is always a matter of probabilities, not certainties, ethics is a probabilistic discipline. “Organic unities” or organic wholes are central to his conception of goodness. The organic whole, for instance, of a beautiful scene and my awareness of it, are worth bringing about, and cannot be broken apart by arguing that merely the awareness of beauty is good. Awareness or knowledge of beauty has little intrinsic value, but as a part of an organic whole, has great value as that part.

2.	Elizabeth Anscombe
Anscombe, a disciple and friend of Wittgenstein, is the first of a certain sort of modern virtue ethicist. In addition to translating Wittgenstein, she contributed to philosophy of action and ethics as well as other areas; she contributed interesting arguments in war theory and sexual ethics. In metaethics, she was against consequentialism (and coined the term) and argued that intention had a necessary practical and theoretical role in ethical reasoning. Especially in her essay on “Modern Moral Philosophies,” she starkly contrasts all law-based and virtue-based accounts of the good life with all modern secular moral philosophies, especially Mill, Hume, and Kant. These latter invoke notions of ‘ought’ and ‘should’ that only make sense within an older foundation of divine legality, which their secular proponents eschew. If I or my community or my species are in a historical relationship with God, then of course there are obligations (and moral obligations) on what I ought or ought not do. Leaving divine law aside, notions of ‘ought’ and ‘should’ centered around the conception of a good human life and human virtues contributing thereto. These notions of justice, courage, etc. are an alternative to legalism, and so for the secular person the only option. Anscombe strenuously rejected consequentialism of all forms, since some bad actions (such as torturing babies for fun) can be known as bad apart from and prior to any consequences. Since 1958, a new and growing field of virtue ethics within professional normative ethics and metaethics and even in non-professional discourse (cf. the TED talk of Barry Schwartz’, a medical doctor, and If Aristotle Ran General Motors by Tom Morris.) Her primary contention in that work is that modern moral philosophies are predicated on errors and are thus false, while most of us do not ascribe to the divine law theory of ethics which grounds right and wrong in the decree of a god — but that the only alternative to divine law is Aristotle’s virtue account. Some have taken her to be denying Aristotle and thus affirming (by implication) divine law. Some have taken her to be denying divine law accounts and thus affirming virtue. Others have taken her more at her word, that her very thesis is a conditional proposition: if not divine law, then virtue. The dilemma, and not either horn, is the conclusion of  her powerful argument. Her critique of Kant is that the notion of self-legislation, when it comes to moral laws, does not make sense, since an obligation is by definition something that is binding on one even if one wishes to change it. Her critique of Mill, in short, is that he and his followers would have to endorse the performance of obvious monstrosities, or that they cannot consistently and clearly say why not to endorse monstrosities. 

3.	Philippa Foot
Foot is a disciple of Anscombe and, second-hand, of Wittgenstein. She died in 2010. Her lifelong oeuvre is focussed primarily on ethics and metaethics. Though her views changed over the course of her life, her metaethical stance is that of cognitivism and virtue ethics. She argues against Ayer, Stevenson, and Hare and who she considered to be their predecessor, Moore, in relegating ethical concepts to a subrational realm. By contrast, ‘thick’ moral concepts run afoul of a strict and untenable fact/value distinction, since they intrinsically combine evaluative and descriptive elements.  Interestingly, she is a naturalist in some sense of the word. Her later work (Natural Goodness) continues on the theme of notions that include both factual and evaluative elements. Aristotelian categorical statements like “humans have 32 teeth” (or “penguins keep their eggs warm”) are neither universal (since there are exceptions) nor particular (since they are normative). Normal humans have that many teeth, baring dysfunction, injury, or sickness. Well-functioning, normal penguins act this way, and all penguins should act this way if they are to preserve their species and flourish qua animals. These evaluative judgments reflect a knowledge of a particular species’ ‘nature’. 
Along similar lines, disagreeing with Moore (in her first chapter of Natural Goodness), she argues that the predicate ‘good’ functions differently than the predicates ‘yellow’ or ‘red,’ since ‘good’ always needs a complement — ‘good for’ or ‘good as.’ A good house is not good simpliciter but good for some person in some situation (say, a mother of six). 
Virtues are those human qualities that are good for human life. Virtues enable and contribute to the species-specific flourishing of individuals and communities. Flourishing includes survival, reproduction, the presence of human-specific pleasure (or absence of pain), and community functioning. For this reason, the good thing to do for us is in the domain of human practical reason: our rationality and practical rationality are part of our nature qua humans. 
How this conception of nature meshes (or doesn’t mesh) with a non-Aristotelian account of nature is a subject of some debate (cf. James Lenman’s article in the SEP). Humans also ‘by nature’ seem to be very different from animals in morally neutral or morally negative ways — so how does one accurately identify the Aristotelian categoricals that are true of (and normatively true) of the way ‘well-functioning’ humans are? The eating of other animals or abstention therefrom provides a test case. 
	This problem comes up in discussions of natural law. Aquinas, for instance, has a whole range of natural goods like individual survival and health, to formation of family and reproduction, to the formation of larger communities with arts and functions, to the culmination of religious worship. Are they ranked? By complexity, yes; by value, not necessarily. What is one to do in cases of conflict between various levels of human goods? There are lots of kinds of pleasure, and they are not commensurate. 
	Aristotle recognizes these questions but does not take that to be his job to answer them. The phronemos is the standard; the wise man is the judge. He gives a formula of temperence, using bodily pleasure in the right way and right time, etc. But that is a schema. To find out what temperence looks like you have to look at the temperate man. That is circular, but not necessarily viciously circular. Moral perception, as in McDowell, comes into the conversation here. The question of whether and whose moral perception is warranted is a problem for ethics. 

4.	Thomas Nagel
Thomas Nagel is a major player in philosophy of law, mind, politics, and ethics. He studied under John Rawls. His writings are also more often reviewed in popular popular and “middle-brow” publications (introduction to philosophy classes, newspapers, blogs, etc.) than many philosophers. His most popular critique of reductionism in consciousness is the “What Is it Like to Be a Bat?” essay (1974), where he argues that there is something it is like to be a creature, to “have a subjective mental or experiential point of view” (Van Lulick, Robert, “Consciousness,” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). His favorite recurring theme is the distinction, interplay, and often tension between the subjective (first-person) and the objective (third-person) points of view.  This is the explicit theme of his The View from Nowhere, which ranges over the gamut of major philosophical areas, including mind,, mind/body, knowledge, thought, freedom, value, ethics, and the meaning of life. But the same theme recurs in many of his writings, including his most recent (as of 2014) Mind and Cosmos, which defends the subjective point of view (even a realist account of rationality and morality) against the overweening pressure of reductive neo-Darwinian physicalist accounts shrilly demanding a third-person account of the whole cosmos, including human minds and communities. 

Nagel’s ethics are realistic, rationalistic, and naturalistic. He does not emphasis virtue ethics. He is a realist in that he thinks there are moral facts and objective ethical concerns that motivate or ought to motivate behavior for every rational agent. He views moral or ethical reasoning as a species of practical reasoning. Practical reason includes both prudential (self-interested) behavior and altruistic (other-interested) behavior. He is a naturalist, in one sense of the word. He argues (in Mind and Cosmos especially) that ‘naturalism’ and hence ‘nature’ needs to be defined to include both physical stuff and subjective, conscious stuff. He argues (in Last Word, View from Nowhere, and Mind and Cosmos) that the domain of ethical truths is independent of any other domain, like biology, psychology, or mathematics. Each domain has first principles (my term, not his) and chains of deductions entailing more specific conclusions within that domain. No domain is beholden to the others to justify its terms and premises by the terms and premises of another: just as mathematicians are not beholden to give justification for their theorems in the terms of biological science, nor vice versa, ethicists are not beholden to give justifications for their theorems in the terms of natural science.Values are real and sufficient justifications for acting on one’s own or anothers behalf. “Agent-neutral” values are reasons for any and every agent.

Nagel also contributed to the popularizing of the term “moral luck” and has argued that those conditions of life over which we have no control (our birth, place in history, location, family, health, and many other aspects of life) affect our “moral standing.”In contrast to the intuitive notion that everyone is responsible for his or her actions and character, regardless of life conditions. “Prior to reflection it is intuitively plausible that people cannot be morally assessed for what is not their fault, or for what is due to factors beyond their control.” (Nagel, 1993, p. 58)

Nagel has also argued for the “fragmentation” of value, that there are multiple valid, competing systems of value with no one overarching system (like morality). According to Adams, “This is the title of chapter 9 of Nagel, Mortal Questions. Related ideas are found in Williams, Moral Luck, chaps. 1, 2, and 5, and in the discussion of “admirable immorality,” in Slote, Goods and Virtues, chap. 4.”

5.	John McDowell
John McDowell writes on all major areas of philosophy, especially metaphysics, epistemology, mind, and language. His favorite interlocutors are both ancient (Plato, Aristotle) and modern (Wittgenstein, Kant). McDowell is a type of philosophical quietist in that he does not want to or aim to develop a positive metaphysics, only to dissolve the apparent problems that crop up in the psyches of modern philosophers. 

His orientation towards value is not reductively naturalistic but is not supernaturalist. He thinks “bald naturalism” is unjustified and false, while “supernaturalism” on the other extreme is scary and threatening. In between sits “second nature” or a “relaxed naturalism” that includes human capacities for active/receptive rational thought and practical reason, including our “sensitivity to reasons” both theoretical and practical. In this space is virtue. 

McDowell argues that ethics must start not with good acts or rules but with good characters — with virtue. In “Virtue and Reason” (1979) he argues virtue is a sort of knowledge: knowledge of what ought to be done. Regardless of whether the proper motivation exists, the virtuous person sees the world differently than the immoralist. On motivation McDowell agrees with Nagel that a belief about the moral facts perceived justify an action and a desire. There can be unjustified desires and justified desires. Contra Hume, who thought both belief and desire necessary to explain (and to justify) an action, they think desire might help explain but does not help justify an action. He also argues that the practical reason that constitutes what ought to be done is not ‘objective’ in the sense that it can be seen from outside the perspective of virtue nor that it can be justified by appeal to third-person ‘scientific’ (bald naturalistic) perspective. Virtuous living has an overall aim of a kind of life. Virtuous living is not mere rule-following like deduction appears to be mere mechanical rule following. But then again, deduction is not mere mechanical rule following. Both are intersubjective and rooted in our forms of life. Following Wittgenstein, the activity that can be expressed as rule-following but not reduced to rule-following is rooted in our ‘forms of life’ — our social condition, our participation in custom, practice, or institution. There is no Platonic reality to which these customs or practices answer and correspond. Even so, they are objective enough to justify our ordinary use of the term; intersubjectivity is sufficient to ground our need for objectivity. Similarly to Nagel, he critiques expressivism and projectivism as misinterpretations of the “obvious fact that ethical... thinking is not science.” So he is not an anti-realist, but he is not a realist. He is not exactly an idealist, either. 

One of McDowell’s own contributions to metaethics is in advancing ‘sensibility theory.’ Moral properties are secondary properties, like colour. Rather than asserting straightforward realism (moral facts are out there) McDowell thinks that value properties do cause us (those of us properly disposed) to have certain beliefs. 

McDowell argues (in “Are Moral Requirements Hypothetical Imperatives?”) against Foot’s early essay “Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives” (the main thesis of which she herself later disavows). He thinks that one can without irrationality question whether one should act as morality requires, but disagrees with the inference that therefore moral requirements are hypothetical (and not categorical) imperatives. 

6.	Richard Rorty
Rorty claims to be a pragmatist and a naturalist. He denies (especially in “Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature” (1979) the traditional notion that knowledge is representation of a mind-independent world. He diagnoses Plato as suffering from this error and as well as analytic philosophy (even when critical of Plato). The alternative is a mixture of Dewey, Hegel, and Darwin that puts epistemology, metaphysics, and science alike firmly in the intersubjective position of etiquette, language, and so on — all of which are liable to social progress in history. There are no givens, no objective starting points, either from empirical or theoretical insight; there is only “what society lets us say” (“Philosophy as Mirror of Nature” 174). If this is so, then there is no metaphysics and there is no science. At least there is no metaphysics and no science as they are traditionally (optimistically) construed — getting at the real world and matching up our concepts and terms to that reality. (In this way Rorty’s naturalism eschews scientism as radically as it eschews religious fundamentalism.) 

What is left is not “mere subjectivism” where there are no constraints on belief and action but constraints internal to the conversation and behavior of the participants. These constraints are liable to change and hence to “progress” — which for Rorty is increasingly democratic and secular society.  He thinks that progress can and should be made in democracy, solidarity, reducing suffering and cruelty, but that these changes will come about not by approximation to truth or goodness but by changing our vocabularies, even though we know that the change is not really significant. We realize that the “redescriptions” of problems and social conditions will not come “closer” to God, nature, an ideal method, or any other standard, but even in so realizing we come closer to a secular humanism. 

7.	J.L. Mackie
Mackie is an anti-realist and the first (of the modern sort of) error-theorist. He argues that all declarative statements with value predicates are false. All value concepts purport to be objective, mind-independent evaluative facts; there are no such facts instantiated in our world; so all predication about them is false. The notion of moral requirements (as traditionally conceived) is that of an objective prescription. Moral reasons are inherent and universally normatively binding. They do not depend on the beliefs or desires of a person. Moral reasons being “objective” Mackie takes to mean that they can be “objects of knowledge... true or false... recognized,” and that they are “prior to and independent of our preferences and choices” (Alexander Miller, “Realism” SEP). Railton disagrees that binding ‘ought’-statements are also reasons for action. The reason he thinks no such values exist is that they are queer, strange, weird, unlike any other kind of plain natural facts. “If there were objective values, then they would be entities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe.” Korsgaard (among others) agrees that they are strange but points out that the inference that they therefore don’t exist is invalid. They are very familiar, more familiar in one sense that plan natural facts. Regardless, Mackie is perplexed. He argues that courses of action are normatively inert. Furthermore, even if objective moral facts existed, they could not be known without a “special faculty of moral perception or intuition, utterly different from our ways of knowing everything else.” Robert Audi’s book Moral Perception attempts to defend just that special faculty. Barring the existence of such a faculty, Mackie and other error-theorists proceed to analyze evaluative talk along very different lines: evaluative talk does something else linguistically besides describe moral truths — it persuades, exhorts, expresses, approves or disapproves, describes fictional truths, etc. 
8.	A.J. Ayer
Ayer is an expressivist of the emotivist kind. Along with Stevenson, Hare, Richards, et. al., he pioneered the contemporary forms of expressivism championed by Simon Blackburn and Alan Gibbard. He argues that value talk that purportedly aims to describe moral facts actually express the emotion of the speaker, namely, disapproval. 
If I say to someone, ‘You acted wrongly in stealing that money’, I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, ‘You stole that money’. In adding that this action is wrong, I am not making any further statement about it. I am simply evincing my moral disapproval about it.It is as if I had said, ‘You stole that money’, in a peculiar tone of horror, or written with the addition of some special exclamation marks. The tone, or the exclamation marks, adds nothing to the literal meaning of the sentence. It merely serves to show that the expression of it is attended by certain feelings in the speaker (Ayer 1946: 107, emphases added).
The chief objection to many forms of expressivism is (the Frege-Geech problem) that evaluative sentences (when combined into complex sentences like conditional propositions) function semantically exactly like descriptive sentences. Blackburn and Gibbard have both attempted to solve this problem by giving accounts of both descriptive and evaluative sentences and accounts of the conditionals (and other complex sentences) in which they appear. 
9.	C. L. Stevenson (Charles Leslie Stevenson)
C.L. Stevenson (1908-1979) is an emotivist and proto-expressivist. Along with Ayer, Hare, Richards, et. al., he pioneered the contemporary forms of expressivism championed by Simon Blackburn and Alan Gibbard. He builds on Ayer but goes further to provide deflationary accounts of human psychology and language that might explain just why ethical talk occurs even though it does not live up to its objective purport.  

At Cambridge, he knew Richards, Moore, and Wittgenstein, and each of these influenced his thought in some way. 

Stevenson analyzed ethical statements into two parts: a declaration of a speaker’s attitude (or value) and an imperative to mirror that attitude or value. Disagreements of moral questions arise from different attitudes. In such cases, agreement can be produced by showing one party that she is not being consistent with higher level moral attitudes, or by “persuasion”. Moral persuasion, in contrast to rational persuasion, corresponds roughly with the pathos division of Aristotle’s three part division of rhetoric into logos, pathos, ethos. It “depends on the sheer, direct emotional impact of words — on emotive meaning, rhetorical cadence, apt metaphor, stentorian, stimulating, or pleading tones of voice, dramatic gestures, care in establishing rapport with the hearer... and so on...not... altering his beliefs, but by exhortation.” (Stevenson, Ethics, 139-40). Disagreements also result, of course, from differences in belief (judgments of fact) and persuasion by argument is here possible. Most actual disagreements are a mixture of differing fact-judgments and value-judgments (beliefs and attitudes), and are thus negotiated by a mixture of argument and raw, thought-less exhortation. 

A long tradition of ethical theorists strongly suggest, whether they always intend to or not, that the disagreement is one in belief. Naturalistic theorists, for instance, identify an ethical judgment with some sort of scientific statement, and so make normative ethics a branch of science. Now a scientific argument typically exemplifies disagreement in belief, and if an ethical argument is simply a scientific one, then it too exemplifies disagreement in belief. The usual naturalistic theories of ethics that stress attitudes—such as those of Hume, Westermarck, Perry, Richards, and so many others—stress disagreement in belief no less than the rest. They imply, of course, that disagreement about what is good is simply one sort of disagreement in belief about attitudes; but we have seen that that is simply one sort of disagreement in belief, and by no means the same as disagreement in attitude. Analyses that stress disagreement in attitude are extremely rare (1948b, 3; see also 1944, 9–10).
These theses also continue to motivate current day expressivists, such Blackburn (1984, 1993) and Gibbard (1990, 2003).
Ethics is not a science. Daniel Voibort summarizes the differences: “Ethical problems, according to Stevenson, are constituted at least in part by disagreement in attitude, while scientific problems are constituted only by disagreement in belief; hence, the function of ethical inquiry is at least in part to coordinate or settle attitudes, while the function of scientific inquiry is to coordinate or settle only beliefs. Ethical language, then, must have features, namely,emotive meaning (Section 3.3), that make it apt for coordinating attitudes, while scientific language need only have features, namely, descriptive meaning (Section 3.3) that make it apt for coordinating beliefs. Finally, the linguistic methods for resolving ethical disputes must be grounded at least in part by the relations among beliefs and attitudes, while those for resolving scientific disputes need be guided only by the relations among beliefs. For these reasons, ethics is not—and cannot be—a science:” (“Stevenson”, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
These considerations about the nature of ethical attitudes motivate and define Stevenson’s contribution to the language and psychology of ethics. Namely, he develops a theory of language that allows language to express and alter attitudes. 
Brand Blanshard and others have objected to Stevenson’s emotivism, including the devastating Frege-Geach problem. Other objections include a reductio from the intuitively false consequent that if an event is bad only because people disapprove of it, then prolonged, meaningless suffering (of which no human being is aware) is not objectively bad.
10.	Kant
Kant is the moral rationalist par excellence. Morality is practical reason. Kant despises virtue ethics, since the notion that virtue is supposed to help someone do his duty is opposed to the notion that the motivation for doing the duty is morally best when it is duty alone that motivates. Doing duty for the sake of happiness is a lesser good. 

Introduction
Pure reason pretends to metaphysical knowledge apart from the senses and apart from applied theoretical reason. The first critique blocks this pretension. Reason must always work within the bounds of intuition (senses) and the categories of judgment. Pure practical reason does presume knowledge of God, freedom, and immortality (as postulates) and must be cultivated. Applied practical reason must be curbed, since it introduces extraneous factors like pleasure and happiness. 

Analytic
Practical reason is the faculty for determining the will. We determine the will by applying general principles to our specific cases. A principle is either a maxim or a law — a maxim is contingent and agent-specific; a law is necessary and agent-neutral. The moral law has a form, and the moral will follows it in form and content. The content is its form — acting only on maxims that can be universally legislated is the content of the moral law. 

Dialectic
Motives aim at some good. Either motives aim at the highest good or at some particular and contingent good. The highest good is only duty. All other motives besides aiming at duty (aiming at pleasure, happiness, or virtue) are imperfect. 

Method
Virtue can be taught by showing examples of virtuous people whose duty lines up with self-love — which will not do because it will not instill in students a love of duty for duty’s sake — or by showing examples of virtuous people whose duty does not line up with self-love — which will not do because it makes duty look onerous and unattractive.

            <Title># MacIntyre 5.5</Title>
            <Text># Alasdair MacIntyre: Virtue in Practice 

### Introduction ###

Alasdair MacIntyre (born 1929) is an influential moral and political philosopher. His eighteen books and greater than three hundred published articles have indelibly impacted analytic ethics. 

### Ideal
MacIntyre embodies the ideal Roy Sellars commended, that the philosopher “should be well-grounded both in the history of philosophy and in the sciences, and... should engage philosophically with the major moral, social, and political issues of the day.”[@mcdonoughroy] 

### Breadth of influence
Refusing to restrict himself to a single topic, MacIntyre has contributed to virtue ethics, communitarianism, the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education; but he has contributed to other fields outside philosophy strictly defined, including sociology and literary analysis. 

Due in part to this multifaceted oeuvre, MacIntyre has had enormous and interdisciplinary influence. One can find citations of his work not only in philosophy but in sociology, medicine, business ethics, political philosophy, bioethics, and more. His books have been translated into several languages and have had an especially significance influence in China. The International Society of MacIntyrean Enquiry holds annual conferences in his honor. 

### Style
Refusing to restrict himself to a strict style, his work often draws on sociology, psychology, and literature for its themes and illustrations. For example, he paints a memorable picture of emotivism as a “culture” with its own paradigmatic “characters”: the Manager and the Therapist.[@macintyre1984after chapter 3] 

### Transitions, adjustments
His career has been characterized by a long evolution within and across various schools of thought. He has adjusted (and in some cases, retracted) his affiliations. For example, he began his career as a Marxist, before “converting” to Aristotelianism, and most recently “converting” to Christianity and Thomism.  

### Did for ethics what Rawls did
 Weinstein observes that Macintyre did for ethics what Rawls did for political philosophy. Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism. Hundreds, if not thousands of articles have responded to Rawls’ work, and the rest of the century saw a flood of books on every nuance of liberal theory.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38] MacIntyre re-invigorated ethical philosophy by attending to its history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.]  

### More on influence
But it is worth noting at the outset that these conclusions are as radical as they are popular. MacIntyre’s ideal audience is "small farmers, fishermen (and women), schoolteachers who refuse to become bureaucratic functionaries, those who retain ideals of craftsmanship in manual or mental labor and members of cooperatives aimed at remedying hunger or homelessness."[@weinstein2003macintyre 8.] In other words, he writes to academics and to regular folks; to individuals and to communities. And, to the surprise of some, his influence has been marked. Those who accept his invitation tend to be more dissatisfied with the present modern culture, modern morality, and modern politics. Such may find his solutions compelling. However, MacIntyre never writes in such a way as to presume to *compel* (neither by reason nor rhetoric) anyone to believe his theory. 

### How he reaches out to his audience
The invitation to recover the virtues of the tradition of Aristotle (and Aquinas and others) really is an *invitation* — it is not a *demand.*  He does not *force* anyone to play by his rules, to accept his definitions of terms. Many have declined his invitation to restore the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Those who decline tend to be more or less content with modern ethical and political thinking as it is. The changes they want to make are corrections and improvements, sometimes extensive changes, but nothing approaching an overhaul. Therefore, they tend to find  MacIntyre's criticisms excessively polemical and his solutions needlessly radical. He invites readers who are not discontent with modernity to self-reflect and to reflect on our common history. They may find something of interest in his criticisms. But even if there is nothing of interest in his criticisms and solutions, they are invited to consider his solutions in a spirit of philosophical imagination. "*If* modern morality were a disaster... would something like this be a good solution?"

### Still evolving

But he is still writing and still thinking. Those who familiar with the expansiveness of his research will not be too quick to declare that his evolution is finished. The full significance of his legacy remains to be seen. I shall offer some tentative predictions at the end of this chapter. 


### Two main themes: history and practical reason
Yet two of his most oft-recurring thematic points have had widespread impact: the first is that ethical terms, concepts, and judgments have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical (and more broadly, evaluative) terms, concepts, and judgments when we have some historical perspective on them. We must know ourselves as members of a “tradition”, that is, a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. 

 A second thematic point is that moral reasoning is a species of practical reasoning *tout court*. That is, moral reasoning is not a special, mystical discipline divorced from prudential, instrumental, and other kinds of practical reasoning. We can only build a clear, coherent, and comprehensive theory of the good if simultaneous we are building a theory of rationality itself. Together, these two themes have guided MacIntyre’s conclusions. 

His commitments to thinking through ethical concepts in tandem with concepts of rationality, and thinking through both in historical/traditional perspective lead him to endorse a set of specific conclusions. Three of those conclusions will be our theme in this chapter. 

I would like to give a cursory statement the primary conclusions under discussion. The first is that we are members of the tradition of liberalism, modernity, the Enlightenment. That slippery word 'we' should be taken, here, to refer to MacIntyre’s western, English-speaking or European readers.

His second conclusion is that modern moral philosophy since the Enlightenment has gotten off track. Compared to the moral, social, and political unity of previous generations or of other cultures in our own time, the last several hundred years of modernity in the west have been a mix of good and bad, but the bad has been disastruous. In fact, philosophical ethics have become unintelligible. If morality is a set of rules, actions, or character traits that are admirable or praiseworthy, then intelligible morality cannot but exist within a nexus of two other concepts: human-nature-as-it-is (identified with help from psychology, sociology, etc.) *and* a conception of “human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-achieved-its-telos”. Our modern, liberal, Enlightenment tradition (which we shall explicate below) got off track, largely due to the attempt to banish *telos* or intrinsic purposes from morality. Opposition to teleology has rendered the virtues, moral duties, praiseworthy actions unintelligible. MacIntyre invites his readers, especially those who already, for independent reasons, find the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition fatally flawed, to give up on its hopeless elements. 

A third conclusion follows from the first two. The restoration of historical perspective and of thinking of ethical reasoning as a species of practical reasoning promises that the restoration of *telos* might make available resources of the older, Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The promise of such a restoration and recovery is immense. A conception of human nature as it is combined with a clear conception of the potential of human nature would lead to a restoration of moral intelligibility.  The restoration of *telos* would make morality intelligible again, which would undergird a restoration of social and political integrity. If the point of education, politics, and social life were once again the acquisition and exercise of virtues, these activities and pursuits would become intelligible in ways that many modern folk can hardly imagine. 

These conclusions are, of course, tersely put. Our job in this chapter is to unpack them. And these conclusions are subject to various important objections. Our job is to articulate and respond to (some of) them.


### Chapter outline

This chapter is divided into four sections. 

**Section 1: Tradition and history**. Section 1 sets the foundation for MacIntyre’s theory of virtue and practical wisdom that he offers as a cure for what ills modern moral philosophy. First, I shall explain MacIntyre’s assumption that we moderns — even putatively “anti-traditionalist” moderns — are part of a “tradition,” and explicate his belief that our modern tradition is fatally flawed. I will tell part of MacIntyre’s personal history, his epistemological crises, that helps make sense of his eventual theories.

**Section 2: Virtue**.  Section 2 summarizes and discusses MacIntyre’s theory of virtue as presented in his four main virtue books. I shall present his positive account of virtue in historical perspective. I shall be required to summarize a set of related supporting concepts. These uphold his account of virtue. They are: practices, the self and its narrative of human life, human nature, *telos*, tradition, and practical rationality. 

**Section 3: Objections**. Section 3 presents a sampling of the powerful objections critics have offered to various aspects of MacIntyre’s theory.  Also, I shall try to identify the main types of critic — crudely put, they are modernists, postmodernists, and MacIntyre’s own fellow Thomists. While it will be impossible to do justice to the excellent replies from MacIntyre's sizable crowd of friends and opponents, I shall  focus on what three of what I take to be three families of superlatively important challenges. The first family of objections pertains to moral  relativism; many worry that MacIntyre has undercut any possibility of intelligibly defending the robust moral realism inherent to the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The second family of objections pertains to rationality and tradition (which are inextricably related in MacIntyre’s work, as we shall see); some worry that his theory of rationality is plainly incoherent.  Others worry that it is coherent but that MacIntyre’s espousing of it *while* arguing his particular ethical conclusions amounts to a performative contradiction. The third family of objections pertains to teleology and the concept of *telos*; some worry that trying to shoehorn teleology back into ethics, even if it were desirable to do so, will require accepting tenets from a discredited Aristotelian metaphysics of nature; others argue that ethics can get along well enough without any need for *telos*. 

**Section 4: Discussion**. Section 4 discusses these various objections and considers whether  MacIntyre’s virtue theory contains the resources with which to answer them satisfactorily.  While I cannot claim to finally calm the worries of his critics, I argue that each of these three families of objections can be answered. I take 'relativism' to be a constellation of theses to the effect that no one person’s or culture’s conception of virtue is rationally superior to any other’s. MacIntyre's account of virtue and rationality has the resources to avoid this; so it is not, at the end of the day, relativistic. Secondly, his notion of tradition-constituted rationality, while frustratingly open to interpretation (by philosophers from varying traditions!) is ultimately a powerful and useful framework with which to explain the paradoxical phenomena of widespread moral disagreement *alongside* widespread moral agreement. Thirdly, the needed type of teleology for MacIntyre’s proposed restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue is credible within our context of modern science, so long as we carefully distinguish various possible types of ‘teleology’ (e.g., there are at least four: cosmic, metaphysical, biological, and social teleologies). With all that said, I shall argue that we should expect any “answer” to such fundamental worries to expose deep metaphilosophical fault lines. So, I shall caution MacIntyre’s allies and enemies to be cautious about hastily labeling each other as “unphilosophical” on the basis of an inability — at the moment — of finally adjudicating these disputes. I shall close this chapter with a reflection on why some find MacIntyre’s philosophical ethics so infuriating and easy to misunderstand. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


## Tradition and history ##

My goal in this chapter is to make an adequate presentation MacIntyre's account of virtue. However, it would be unwise quickly to dive in to that presentation without two preliminaries. To see why, consider two of his early (and by no means final) formulations of a definition of virtue: virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices.”[@macintyre1984after 191] And secondly:

&gt;The virtues find their point and purpose not only in sustaining those relationships necessary if the variety of goods internal to practices are to be achieved and not only in sustaining the form of an individual life in which that individual may seek out his or her good as the good of his or her whole life, but also in sustaining those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context.[@macintyre1984after 223]

These formulations define virtue in terms of "practices" that an individual engages in throughout his or her "whole life", all in context of a "tradition". These three concepts -- practice, life, and tradition -- are constitutive parts of MacIntyre's account of virtue. While discussions of *practice* and *life* can wait, I should be cutting off the Hydra’s immortal head if I were to explain *tradition* at the outset. Thankfully, a brief preliminary explanation will suffice for now. More details will emerge as they are needed.

### We inhabit a tradition ###

MacIntyre maintains that every inquirer inhabits a tradition. What does this mean? First we must take the point in its least controversial and hence most trivial sense that each inquirer is an embodied human being, living in a particular time and place, speaking (and perhaps thinking) within a given language, inquiring within a particular social setting. These trivia are not very interesting yet. But they are only the beginning.  

What is a tradition? "A living tradition . . . is an historically extended, socially embodied argument…"[@macintyre1984after 222. He specifies that the content of the tradition is self-reflexive: "…  an argument precisely in part about the goods which constitute that tradition."] deriving from a source text and continuing across generations via normal sociological channels (schools, friendships, political institutions, etc.). So, for example, by MacIntyre's lights Judaism is a tradition rooted in a source text (the Tanakh) and continuing across generations through arguments carried out in synagogues, universities, and so on about how to best interpret and apply the Tanakh and later commentaries. Augustinianism is a tradition rooted in the Holy Bible and Augustine's corpus, consisting in socially-embedded arguments over how to best interpret and apply Augustine; history-writing is a tradition, rooted in source texts such as Herodotus, and Thucydides, Gibbon and extending through Europe and the western world, consisting of a series of historical and historiographical arguments over not just "what happened" but how to define history, how to conduct historical enquiry. 

With all this said, MacIntyre assumes that "we" inhabit a tradition. Some readers may object: Do “we” (Anglo-Americans in particular or westerners in general) inhabit a “tradition” at all? MacIntyre argues that we do. What tradition is it supposed to be? It is variously titled: liberalism, modern liberalism, modernity, Enlightenment modernity. (Liberalism does not correlate to the contemporary political division between “conservatives” and “liberals.” Rather, liberalism in this sense encompasses both contemporary “liberals” and “conservatives”.) For simplicity, in most instances I shall use the simple term ‘modernity’ or ‘Enlightenment modernity’ to describe this tradition. 

In the (1990) Gifford Lectures, MacIntyre presented three rival versions of moral inquiry as expressions of three rival traditions.[@macintyre1990three] A book was later made of these lectures. Richard Forty wrote that the book “deepens and defends MacIntyre’s claim that genuinely rational enquiry requires membership in a particular type of moral community. He offers the most persuasive recent restatement of the Thomist position on the relation of metaphysics to morality.” What are the “three rival versions”? He labels them ‘genealogy,’ ‘encyclopedia’, and ‘tradition’. Now, the use of the single word ‘tradition’ to mean both the genus (with three species) *and* one of those three species is deadly confusing, so I propose to call the third tradition Thomism. 

The three are defined by their respective attitudes toward the past. Genealogists use the past to subvert and “debunk” the present. Encyclopedists use the present to denigrate and “debunk” the past. Thomists use the past as a basis for building upon and yet transcending the past. 

&gt;The “Nietzschean research program” has three uses for history: (1) to reduce academic history to a projection of the concerns of modern historians, (2) to dissipate the identity of the historian into a collection of inherited cultural influences, and (3) to undermine the notion of “progress towards truth and reason” (3RV, pp. 49-50). In short, Genealogy denies the teleology of human enquiry by denying (1) that historical enquiry has been fruitful, (2) that the enquiring person has a real identity, and (3) that enquiry has a real goal. MacIntyre finds this mode of enquiry incoherent.[@lutz2015]

Genealogists think, in advance, that no one in the future can use the present as a foundation. Encyclopedists think, in advance, that no one in the future will ever be able to transcend the present; they think “we have arrived.” Thomists think, in advance, that those in the future will use the present as a foundation for building upon and yet transcending the present. The genealogist par excellence is Frederich Nietzsche, though Foucault and Derrida get honorable mention. The encyclopedist par excellence is the ninth edition of the *Encyclopedia Brittanica* and to Adam Lord Gifford (1820–1887) himself. Gifford was a senator of the College of Justice in Scotland and inaugurated these prestigious lectures to represent the “state of the art” of all knowledge. As for the *Britannica*, one reviewer put the point this way: 

&gt;The *Britannica* represents the idea of an impersonal, universal, tradition-free conception of rational enquiry into morals, telling a story of the progress of reason in philosophy an the sciences through an appeal to timeless, universal principles of rationality. The encyclopedic tradition holds moral enquiry to be about an autonomous, distinct realm of human life, which can and must be understood solely in its own terms." 

For reasons we shall discuss, MacIntyre thinks this version of rational enquiry is doomed. Nevertheless "it still exercises an extraordinary influence on contemporary thought and on university curricula."[@pinkard1991three] 

Now, modernity is an encyclopedic tradition. I was educated in a modern university on modern fare, as were my readers (I presume). So, by MacIntyre’s lights, we are “encyclopedists.” Our source texts are Hume, Kant, Newton, Locke, and others. Ours is a tradition extended through time and socially embedded in the U.S., Canada, England and parts of Ireland and Scotland. The encyclopedic tradition is not narrow; it is indeed *encyclopedic*. It has political, scientific, religious, and philosophical aspects. The intellectual tradition of modernity arises alongside the rise of the modern state. We do well to remember that almost all the luminaries of the Enlightenment philosophy also wrote on politics: Mill’s ethical writings are almost always written with an eye to reformer civil law; Kant wrote books like *Perpetual Peace*; John Locke wrote about perception and understanding but also treatises on government. Within modernity, we analytic philosophers have further source texts in Russell, Frege, and Wittgenstein, instigating arguments over how to best conduct philosophical enquiry, the definition of analytic philosophy, and the relationship between language and thought. These arguments take place almost exclusively in a university setting, through academic books, conferences, lectures, seminars, and journal publications rather than (as in other times) through newspapers, popular books, parliamentary debates, and so on. 

The difference between 'tradition' and neighbor concepts, such as culture, theory, institution, inquiry, and practice will, I hope, become clearer below. And a few objections to MacIntyre's allegedly vague definition will be discussed below. The reader is not yet expected to agree with such a characterization of tradition. It is sufficient, at this juncture, to grasp the point and to grant it as an axiom for what follows. 

### MacIntyre's intellectual history ###

MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a living moral tradition, the Aristotelian tradition. Before I presented his account of virtue, I needed to supply at least a makeshift account of tradition. There is one other account I need to give. Even with a notion of ourselves as embodied members of a living tradition of Enlightenment modernity in hand, it would be an injustice to MacIntyre's way of presenting his theory as the fruit of his own philosophical enquiry if I did not briefly tell the story of that enquiry. 

MacIntyre's intellectual history is a story of several intellectual crises. Each crisis compelled him to draw on the resources of history and of contemporary philosophy and science to discover not just a more adequate answer to the particular intellectual problem but to reflect on methodology. 

He grew up in a "border" culture between rustic Scottish fishing villages and the elite intellectual life offered him at the independent Epsom College and by his tutor R. G. Collinwood. During his undergraduate study of the classics at Queen Mary College of the University of London, he acquired an interest in ethics. He pursued an M.A. At the University of Manchester and wrote his thesis ("*The Significance of Moral Judgments*") critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson. 

From his early work on Marxism and historical ethics, to his middle period writing on virtue, moral epistemology, and tradition, to his latest writings on the university, one persistent theme has been a radical critique of the foundations of Enlightenment modernity.[@mcmylor2005alasdair] Many who critique the rationalism and foundationalism of modernity end up with "the masters of suspicion" who distrust thought, language, and rationality itself. MacIntyre took a surprising course. The kinds of critical analysis the "masters of suspicion" use did level to the ground much of the edifice of modernity. But rather than embracing a thorough, cynical, postmodernism of this sort, MacIntyre took to an older and still vital foundation among the ruins. It is upon this foundation of Aristotelian virtue, and eventually Thomism, that MacIntyre continues to build. 

One of MacIntyre's most memorable and oft-cited images compares modern moral discourse to the hypothetical state of scientific discourse in a post-apocalyptic catastrophe. Only decaying fragments of intelligible moral discourse survive. He invitation is this: 

&gt;Imagine that the natural sciences were to suffer the effects of a catastrophe. A series of environmental disasters are blamed by the general public on the scientists. Widespread riots occur, laboratories are burnt down, physicists are lynched, books and instruments are destroyed. Finally a Know-Nothing political movement takes power and successfully abolishes science teaching in schools and universities, imprisoning and executing the remaining scientists. Later still there is a reaction against this destructive movement and enlightened people seek to revive science, although they have largely forgotten what it was. But all that they possess are fragments: a knowledge of experiments detached from any knowledge of the theoretical context which gave them significance; parts of theories unrelated either to the other bits and pieces of theory which they possess or to experiment; instruments whose use has been forgotten; half-chapters from books, single pages from articles, not always fully legible because torn and charred. Nonetheless all these fragments are reembodied in a set of practices which go under the revived names of physics, chemistry and biology. Adults argue with each other about the respective merits of relativity theory, evolutionary theory and phlogiston theory, although they possess only a very partial knowledge of each. Children learn by heart the surviving portions of the periodic table and recite as incantations some of the theorems of Euclid. Nobody, or almost nobody, realizes that what they are doing is not natural science in any proper sense at all. For everything that they do and say conforms to certain canons of consistency and coherence and those contexts which would be needed to make sense of what they are doing have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.[@macintyre1984after 1]

The picture here captures the state of moral discourse. The moral problems moderns face they can only address using the scraps of a previous and whole moral tradition. Since modern researchers (philosophers, historians, sociologists, etc.) all use methods and even practice disciplines that post-date the catastrophe, they cannot recognize the futility of their own research in recovering the coherence that has been lost. 

Now, MacIntyre's image is not merely about morality as one sub-field within academic philosophy. It is about morality as part of the fabric of social and political life, part of what binds groups together, gives urgency and meaning to their joint projects, sustains consensus about civil laws by which honors and goods are distributed and criminal punishments are delivered. We live, MacIntyre surmises, in an “emotive” culture. We use each we do not assume nor strive for common moral standards. An obvious symptom of the decay of moral discourse and social unity is interminable ethical disagreement.[@macintyre1984after 6] Moral discourse is largely devoted to moral disagreement, and moral disagreement is largely soaked in despair of ever reaching agreement. It is “shrill” disagreement because each side is attempting to win by rhetoric; and each side is attempting to win by rhetoric because each side believes that no dialectical or logical case can be made on behalf of their value theory. Oddly enough, however, neither side wants to give up the *appearance* of having a dialectical case for its value theory. Moral discourse with its interminable moral disagreement retains the rhetorical *trappings* of rationality and objectivity while denying rationality and objectivity.

Culturally and politically, moral discourse is a mess. In academia, things are no better. Professional ethicists disagree with each other on any applied ethical issue you can think of such as the permissibility of abortion, the standards of justice in war, the limits of medical regulation and so on. They also disagree about the background issue in resolving practical moral problems -- that is, which normative framework to use, deontology, utilitarianism, divine command theory, contractarianism, quietism, ironic nihilism or something else entirely. Modern ethicists have sometimes taken comfort in the retreat to meta-ethics. Perhaps stepping back from sticky normative questions will permit the calm, cool, and rational resolution of some problems in moral semantics, moral metaphysics, and moral epistemology. Yet after a century of metaethics, the field has not consolidated but proliferated moral disagreements. Both parties are passionate, informed, intelligent, open-minded and yet cannot come to anything like agreement on the formal and material propositions under dispute. It seems that deep and abiding disagreement within normative ethics and metaethics is the defining datum of modern moral philosophy. This is the "catastrophe" MacIntyre pictures above.

Rather than despair, MacIntyre observed an analogy between morality and science that proved extremely fruitful. He was deeply moved by Thomas Kuhn's influential work on the structure of revolution between various paradigms in the natural sciences.[@kuhn1975structure] What if a similar structure obtained in revolution between paradigms or traditions in the "moral sciences"? Anyone familiar with Kuhn's watershed *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* has felt the significance of his provocative argument. Briefly, as I read it, Kuhn's work directly confronts the widespread and naive belief that consensus in natural scientific inquiry has been growing in slow and steady straight line since the 1600s. Rather, Kuhn persuasively argues, specific paradigms by which practitioners conduct research and through which they interpret evidence come and go. Some are fruitful, and are employed for generations. But some stagnate. A paradigm is a research program that unites many researchers with a methodology and unites their conclusions within a stable scientific system of doctrine. The encyclopedia of knowledge can be augmented or pruned, but its taxonomy stays mostly the same. A paradigm comes in for trouble when lingering worries about the fine points of a scientific system and research program beget doubts about that system as a whole. If not resolved, these worries bloom into a full-blown epistemological crisis. At certain periods of epistemological crisis, researchers from rival programs (once dismissed) burst into the limelight by solving a problem the previous paradigm did not have the conceptual resources to solve. A paradigm shifts, a revolution has occurred. The new paradigm becomes entrenched in the establishment. Once young, rebellious, and revolutionary, it becomes middle-aged, stable, and respectable. It is the scientific paradigm of a new era. From the perspective of one paradigm, it is difficult or impossible to judge the rational credentials of a rival paradigm. 

Now, Kuhn concluded his study in a radical pluralism about rationality and methodology. This smacks of a scientific relativism unpalatable to many scientific realists. Paul Feyerabend cheerfully embraced this possibility. He argued for "epistemological anarchism," where *any* method will do as long as it is "fruitful." He thought that "rationality" and "science" were merely bully terms with sociological power to club dissenters from the dominant paradigm into submission. MacIntyre took a different tack.

MacIntyre began to speculate about the possibility that Kuhn and Feyerabend’s analyses of scientific progress and scientific crisis could be fruitfully applied to ethics. His 1977 essay on epistemological crises was his own version of Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* -- we might call this essay MacIntyre's "Structure of Ethical Revolutions".[@macintyre1977epistemological] The parallel between the two explains several features of MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy. MacIntyre’s ethical theory is both extremely cognizant of historical background and extremely cognizant of methodology; some have thought his ethics (of the good) collapses into epistemology (a means of rationally identifying the good). The thought is a mistake, but an understandable one. An understandable mistake that also happens in the philosophy of science. 

This comparison between *ethical* crises and *scientific* crises makes clear why the epistemology of morality features so prominently in MacIntyre's later works. He is not only trying to give an account of the good but trying to give an account of the rational faculties and rational resources by which communities and individuals discover the good. 

MacIntyre's ethical philosophy began in crisis and despair, but did not end there. It ended, rather, in a thoroughgoing Thomism that is at once historicist and progressive, at once optimistic and anti-relativistic. Making sense of such a conclusion is not easy. But it is much easier if we are clear about where his radical critic of the modern tradition arises from, and how he aims to solve it. 

## Virtue, Practice, Tradition

I can now present MacIntyre's account of virtue.  His virtue theory is not fully supplemented until he completes the“*After Virtue* Project” consisting of *After Virtue* (1984), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988); *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990); and *Dependent Rational Animals* (1999). But the most focused presentation is *After Virtue*. We will begin there. 

In this section, I will reflect in detail on his initial definition, which he derives from a careful study of the traditions of virtue from Homer, Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragic poets, the New Testament, Aquinas, Jane Austen, and Benjamin Franklin. Then I will summarize how he expands this definition with supporting concepts such as the self (which is the bearer of individual virtue), practice (which is an activity in which virtues are needed), practical reason (which is our human nature). 

Each of these interlocking concepts build on and also support his conception of virtue. If these concepts as presented are accurate to the phenomena of human life, then each one lends support to MacIntyre’s conviction that “humans need the virtues.” 

### Virtue — a first pass

MacIntyre’s philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’ within *After Virtue*. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and concludes with his own His account is historical but not historicist; it aims for universality but is not purely abstract conceptual analysis. It is, in a word, traditional. MacIntyre’s definition emerges from history but is not restricted to its history; he does not vow to conserve. Yet it does not appear “out of heaven”, unprecedented, unpredicted, unaccountable, and ready-made. 
His first definition, as mentioned above, is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191] A few initial comments are in order about each phrase of this definition. 

First, virtues are acquired *human* qualities, presumably opposed to analogous qualities of lower animals.  Formal or functional qualities that enable an animal to survive and thrive (i.e., the flexible flagellum of the bacterium, the swiftness of a deer) are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. Now, MacIntyre later changes his mind on this point. *Dependent Rational Animals* will challenge *After Virtue*’s presumed opposition between human and non-human animals. 

Secondly, virtues are *acquired* human qualities. In the first line of Plato's *Meno*, Meno asks Socrates a question that moral philosophers have continued to try to answer for the last 2,400 years. He asks "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is *acquired.* This is important because, as a recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses, one important question for virtue ethicists is the range of what positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, limits the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. In this, he agrees with Aristotle that virtue is *in accordance with* nature but not *by nature*. That is, we might say, virtues do not arise "automatically" but also are not acquired by working against the grain of our human nature. Rather, they can be seen as a "normal" psychological outgrowth of cultivating certain human practices. 

Thirdly, virtues enable their possessor to achieve particular *goods.* There are two implicit points here. Virtues by definition are beneficial. A virtuous trait *cannot* be directed at achieving ills. This point solves by definitional fiat a very vexing question that recurs often in ethical philosophy, namely, can overall vicious and wicked people have particular virtues? Can the thief be courageous, the dictator magnanimous, the glutton affable? It certainly seems that the answer is yes. I shall discuss this point a bit more under the objection of relativism. 

A second implicit point is that virtues here seem to be defined instrumentally.  A misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both instrumental (to the achievement of certain goods) and also *partly constitutive of those goods.* Virtues are both means to an end and also ends in themselves. Phronesis or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in greater happiness and thriving as a human being. But also having phronesis *just is part of the definition* of being a thriving human being. Now, this refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. As Charles Taylor points out:

&gt;It is a feature of many modern theories... that they cannot abide this kind of relation, in which one element is both cause and constituent of another. It is a central demand of one influential construal of modern reason that one clearly sort out means from ends. For utilitarians, the good is happiness, and virtues can only be good instrumentally... If the basic point of morality is to do the right actions, then the virtues must be seen as purely executive. They cannot also be seen as part of the end, because the end is not defined that way.[@taylor 25] 

This worry exposes deep fault lines. For the sake of completing my presentation of virtue, I must set it aside for now. I shall return to it under the heading of the objection about teleology.  

Fourthly, MacIntyre defines virtues with reference goods internal to *practices*. Practice is a key term of art within MacIntyre's theory of virtue. To misunderstand 'practice' would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. So with these initial comments in hand, I shall more deeply explore MacIntyre's unfolding account of virtue in the following sub-sections. Each section will elaborate on one of the following key components: practice, self, and tradition. 

### Practice ###

What is a practice? A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends. Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. MacIntyre mentions chess, farming, and political activity as examples *inter alia*. A practice is not merely a reflexive action (like scratching an itch) nor merely a single, discrete, intelligible action (like pulling a weed); it is an intelligible set of actions such as tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc., all embedded within a social context and organized around a particular goal. Farming is a social activity undertaken (let's say) for the sake of producing sufficient quantities of edible food for the farmer, the farmer's family, and the general marketplace. (This example is not intended to be controversial — please overlook any factual mistakes on the details.) Farming as a practice has a history or series of cultural histories, a set of farmers who belong to it or practice it, and a common set of standards that define good and bad farming.  

Leading MacIntyre scholar, Christopher Lutz, analyzes MacIntyre’s famous passage into the following four statements. A practice is: 

&gt;[1] a complex social activity that [2] enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. [3] Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, [3] the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.[@lutz2015] 

As this explication makes more clear, MacIntyre’s notion of virtue and practice is tied to the goods “internal to” practices. He later calls internal goods "goods of excellence" and calls external ones "goods of effectiveness.” The point here is, I think, clear. The goods internal to farming are just those that *necessarily constitute success within a given practice as it is*: the production of good food, edible food, nutritious food, etc. (Of course, not all farmers aim to produce comestibles, but I am generalizing.) Virtues relative to the practice of farming might include strength, dexterity with equipment, sensitivity to service animals, etc. Without these, the goods internal to farming are unachievable. 

Goods "external" to farming are those that might result from the practice but are not necessary parts: fame, fortune, good friends, physical fitness. Mere efficiency in attaining such external goods does not entail the presence of a virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue external goods in the course of engaging in a practice is not just a neutral desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed at political activity, judging “success” only by the standards defined within practice itself. 

An illustrative example is political activity. Political activity can be undertaken by agents motivated to achieve goods internal or external to the practice. That is, some people engage in political activity *in order to bring about* the health, securing, and flourishing of the *polis*. But others (we need not speculate the proportion!) engage in order to achieve “external”, unessential, goods such as satisfying their own ambition, achieving fame and power. Very often we see American politicians running for office with apparently only one aim: book sales. 

As I see it, virtue defined by practice can already be significantly contrasted against mere *happiness* or *pleasure* as found in Mill, and against mere *duty* or *good will* as found in Kant. On the one hand, the standards by which farmers judge each other are not static and universal formal laws. They are “contentful,” immanent, flexible standards. On the other hand, the standards by which practitioners judge each other are not all “external” ; they are not merely an arbitrary set of social conventions. Farmers cannot get together and decide farming is no longer about husbandry but is about selling land along highways for billboard advertisements. The practice itself, with its history and its aims, has a structure that is persists across generations and flexes, but does not break, with varying standards. That structure is passed along, modified, but modified according to an inner logic. Many have agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe’s characterization of consequentialism more generally that it views all consequences as “external.” She puts the point in this way: 

&gt;Now the consequentialist has no footing on which to say "This would be permissible, this not"; because by his own hypothesis, it is the consequences that are to decide, and he has no business to pretend that he can lay it down what possible twists a man could give doing this or that; the most he can say is: a man must not bring about this or that; he has no right to say he will, in an actual case, bring about such-and-such unless he does so-and-so.[@anscombe1958 13] 

I shall return to this discussion of external goods below in the teleological objection. 

The internal goal of farming is (by my hypothesis) the production of edible food; its practitioners *as farmers* are committed to this goal without any eye toward broader features of farming as a business. A farmer may attend conferences about the future of his field, but he does not do so in his strict role as farmer, but in his role as citizen or businessman. By contrast, the practice of farming demands specific virtues. A farmer must be honest in order to maintain positive relationships with various suppliers and buyers; a farmer must be courageous, willing to withstand real pain and risk possible harm for the sake of the good being pursued, in order to face unseasonable weather, illness, or other misfortune. 

### Self ###

MacIntyre's account of virtue begins in terms of practices. Virtues sustain and eventually improve practices while vices enervate and eventually ruin them. A second layer of his account in *After Virtue* defines virtues as beneficial *to* human beings, human selves.[@macintyre1984after chapter 15.] Humans perform practices; humans are the bearers of virtues and vices. What is a human self? The Enlightenment picture of selfhood, personality, or agency is a radical divergence from the prior tradition. Drawing the contrast between MacIntyre’s view and the modern puts into clear relief the differing conceptions of the good, of nature, and of *telos*. 

The Enlightenment concept is the empty self. The self is not social *by nature*; it is atomic by nature and only social by choice, or contract, or artifice. The empty self does not have a history; the body arises from a biological history but the self emerges as it were from nowhere, suddenly possessed of detached freedom. The empty self does not have a naturally-ordained destiny; it is self-determining, self-legislating, and ultimately self-creating.

John Horton and Susan Mendus summarize the contrast well enough to quote them in full:

&gt;Where Aristotle understood man as a creature with a definite function which he might fulfill or deny, modern morality sees man simply as a rational agent who has no true or definable purpose independent of his own will... By appealing to a *telos*, Aristotle was able to distinguish between the way we actually are and the way we should be. His conception of human beings as having a specific *telos* brought with it the possibility that we might fall short of the ideal... But with the rejection of Aristotelianism gain the rejection of any such distinction between what we are and what we should be. Post-Enlightenment man is seen as governed, not by a *telos* external to him, but simply by the dictates of his own inner reason... Thus the abandonment of an Aristotelian conception of the good has not only left us without standards by which to evaluate our moral arguments, it is also cast us adrift in the moral world. For Aristotle, a conception of the good for man has an essentially societal dimension.[@horton2015 6] 

The Enlightenment thinkers (such as Kant) and their heirs (such as John Rawls) reject inherent teleology and inherent sociality. Indeed, they celebrate the empty self. The elimination of these strictures seem an increase in freedom. But the Enlightenment picture of the empty self is, MacIntyre thinks, disastrously wrong. The strictures do not result in increased freedom but increase in anxiety and despair. 

It is difficult to understate the importance of this point about the self and its relation to not only virtue theory but ethical theory itself. Edward Oakes describes the removal of *telos* from our worldview as “perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy.”

&gt;That word “teleological” is the key to MacIntyre’s solution, the loss of which is the cause of the catastrophe described in his science-fiction parable. Teleology is the study of final causes, goals, purposes, and aims: a style of explanation that saturates Aristotle’s philosophy. After the combined impact of Newton and Darwin, however, this type of explanation seems mostly 'quaint' and once Aristotle’s science seemed quaint, his ethics soon followed: when Newton demonstrated how motion can be better explained as resulting from the outcome of mechanical laws, and when Darwin posited natural selection as the “mechanism” for explaining an organ’s functionality, the use of teleology in ethics was doomed.
&gt;This is perhaps the greatest category mistake ever made in the history of philosophy. Emptying moral discourse of teleological concepts because of the perceived impact of Newton and Darwin has been for MacIntyre the catastrophe of our times.[@oakes1996] 

It will come as no surprise that MacIntyre’s view of the self, the narrative of life, the end of humanity, ethics, and rationality itself come to be built on the notion of *telos*, restored to its proper place. In the modernist picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. My present self is a time slice of my overall total self (through time), I am able to know facts and value values, I have my own good separate and apart from your good and that of my family and community and society. In the traditional picture, I am a moral subject. I am a self among other selves. In the present, I owe my being and personhood to the past (especially my family who biologically gave me being) and psychologically and culturally to my tradition. I am able to know truth, for there is only one manifold of truths. My good is that of my community; my community’s good is that of mine. These data are fundamental. 

On this issue, MacIntyre argues the standard communitarian line.[Cf. @taylor1985atomism] The detachable empty self, divorced from past and from community is not the real self.  While this section is not the place to adjudicate this dispute, a few comments are worth making to clarify MacIntyre’s location on the conceptual map.

Two considerations are often cited as evidence of the communitarian view of the self. First is the sociological and anthropological point that each of us belongs by nature to a family (via genetics) and a culture (via upbringing). There is no Tarzan or Mowgli raised outside a culture. Rather, it is in social institutions (clubs, churches, schools, guilds, towns) that practices are learned, taught, preserved, extended. In social conditions we develop what virtues we may possess and what vices we may suffer from. We are trained in cowardice and vice by "corrupt traditions.”[@macintyre1984after 223] 

Second is the observation that *we do bear* responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. One example likely to be persuasive to modern liberal thinkers is that of transatlantic slavery. A present day black American's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century blacks to 18th century whites. Similarly, present day Irishman's identity is in part defined by the relationship of 18th century Englishman to the 18th century Irish slaves. If the notion of the detachable self were true, then my personal identity would have nothing to do with the trials and triumphs of those in the past; I could justly deny any part in pre-existing structures. 

By contrast, it seems that each of us takes an identity, at least in part, from our past and from our tradition. 

### *Telos* and happiness ### 

For MacIntyre, the loss of *telos* (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But *telos* unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear *telos* is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

In the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”, the *Nicomachean Ethics*, MacIntyre finds the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific *telos*. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that *telos*.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The *telos* of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 

His provisional conception of our human *telos* is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human *telos* is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single *telos* governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of *telos*). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and *telos* comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a *telos*, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our *telos*. 

MacIntyre says: 

&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of *telos* as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their *telos*, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not a eudaimonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaimonist. He seems to be saying that our *telos* is to be free to pursue our *telos*. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human *telos* (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the *telos* might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our *telos* consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate *telos* of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. 

I defer a full discussion of teleology until the next section. If we return to the concept of practice with the *teleological* and *social* properties firmly in mind, then MacIntyre's account becomes more clear. Farming is not a solitary and abstract activity but is always undertaken by farmers who apprenticed (under parents or mentors). Farmers who master the practice become not only beneficiaries but benefactors, and may innovate new or better ways of farming that can be passed on to the next apprentice or child. 

Thus far, we have seen that MacIntyre presents virtues as those qualities acquired by individual selves in the performance of practices that serve the intrinsic teloi or ends of those practices. 


### An initial worry 

One worry that many readers have shared is that MacIntyre’s account of virtue, thus far, is all too easily seen as a type of relativism: Is torture a “practice”? Is grand theft auto a practice that one can be excellent at? It certainly seems reasonable to think that some acquired qualities allow one to achieve the goods internal to car stealing. MacIntyre vehemently denies being a relativist and devotes the whole of *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* to capturing the truth in *relativity* while escaping relativism.

He admits that there *might* be evil practices. (We can add that institutions or traditions can be evil.) If so, then some “virtues” that enable the achievement of goods and the health and continuance of institutions would be bad qualities. MacIntyre's earlier theory cannot overcome this objection, Lutz argues. He says:

&gt;Unfortunately, the relativism of *After Virtue* cannot be overcome unless its definitions of the virtues are extended to embrace the Aristotelian and Thomistic doctrine of the unity of virtue. Macs rejection of the unity of virtue in *After Virtue* has grave implications for the rest of his virtue theory because the rejection of the unity of virtue divroces the intellectual moral virtue of prudence from the passional moral virtues of courage, temperence, and justice... Prudence becomes cleverness. Courage and temperance are relativized, so that one could reasonable speak of the virtue of courage in a Nazi... Likewise, justice is reduced to some notion of fairness.[@lutz2004tradition 98]

There have been ethical philosophers who endorse this kind of reductive virtue. Lutz mentions Edmund Pincoff as an "emotivist virtue theorist" (using "emotivist" in the narrower, MacIntyrean sense). Lutz continues by examining the implications of such a theory. Such a move has two main effects: (1) "It constitues the rejection of the Aristotelian practical syllogism that MacIntyre wanted to recover in *After Virtue* because it separates prudent reasoning from virtuous action. (2) It evacuates all falsifiable substantive moral content from the virtues, reducing them to enabling qualities."[@lutz2004tradition 100] The commonsense definition of "virtue" includes positive valence. A virtue is, within our tradition, a quality *admirable for its own sake* or else a quality that enables its bearer to *achieve admirable goals*. If a procedure results in a definition of virtue wherein even bad qualities or even good qualities that enable any given wicked goal, then the procedure has gone awry. 

To avoid relativism, he must say something to do justice to the assumption that virtues are not neutral with respect to ends, but are actually *good* for their possessor. He must put practice into a broader teleological context and question whether life *as a whole* can be virtuous. He does say that the virtue of “integrity or constancy… of singleness of purpose in a whole life.”[@macintyre1984after 203] Integrity is not our *telos*, but it is a necessary condition. Even putting human life into a unified, narrative context does not ultimately solve the problem of relativism. For we still might worry: is there a single *telos* for human life? Is there a unity to all the virtues such that “wicked virtues” can be excluded? And if so, is it rooted in our “metaphysical biology” as Aristotle thought? 

A fuller discussion of relativism I return to below, clarifying the charge and rebutting it. For now, the charge of relativism effectively motivates MacIntyre’s third layer in the *After Virtue* account. His answer to this worry is, I believe, the crux of his whole theory of ethics. It appeals to two concepts that are, for him, intimately bound up with each other. The two concepts are practical reason and human nature. (In the next section, I shall show how practical rationality and tradition meld into one concept.) I shall discuss each in turn and attempt to show how they are unified in MacIntyre’s thought. 

### We are practical reasoners ###

I would like to add details from *Dependent Rational Animals* before turning to *Whose Justice?* The project of *Dependent Rational Animals* is to insist that (a) human beings are animals even if we are animals of a particular and unusual sort; and that (b) our dependence and vulnerability are as morally significant as our independence, autonomy, or self-sufficiency. In other words, there are virtues of both autonomy *and* dependence. The book also contends that (c) certain social arrangements are conducive to the transmission and sustenance of both kinds of virtue.  

Let’s consider a key quotation on each of these themes. Regarding (a) the notion that we are unusual animals, MacIntyre argues at length that the human differentia (be it language, reason, practical reason, self-consciousness, or what have you) does not eradicate the commonalities between us and other animals. He says: 

&gt;“I shall contend that although our differences from all other species are certainly of crucial importance, it is also important that both initially in our earliest childhood activities and to some extent thereafter we comport ourselves towards the world in much the same way as other intelligent animals. Indeed our ability to transcend those limitations depends in part upon certain of those animal characteristics among them the nature of our identity.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

The point, I take it, is that we are practical reasoners. Imagine any scenario of humans gathering and doing what comes naturally, and it will involve group deliberation about what to do: A group of high school students exiting class for lunch stop in the hallway and argue about where to sit; a senate sub-committee convenes to deliberate on whether to pull federal funding from a particular health organization; a U.N. Assembly convenes to deliberate whether to place sanctions on a recalcitrant nation; a philosophy professor chats with the department chair about how to boost the number of majors; a father and mother sip wine, after the kids are in bed, while arguing over the grocery budget. The pattern each instantiates is a group of human beings engaging in practical reason — a community thinking what to do. It is difficult to get out of bed in the morning without engaging in practical reasoning with others. Abduct the principle from the particulars: human beings, us, are practical reasoners in community. We are practical reasoners in communities. 

This is the first point. The second is that our lives are not lived out as adults, but progress from young, to middle aged, to old. Regarding point (b), he argues that vulnerability, dependence, affliction characteristic especially of early childhood and old age, but also of any sickness, injury, or misfortune are highly morally significant.  As he says:  

&gt;“Virtues of independent rational agency need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by what I shall call the virtues of acknowledge dependence and that a failure to understand this is apt to secure some features of rational agency. Moreover both sets of virtues are needed in order to actualize the distinctive potentialities that are specific to the human rational animal. Identifying how and why they are needed is a prerequisite for understanding their central place in the kind of human life through which human flourishing can be achieved.”[@macintyre1999dependent 8] 

Finally, regarding (c), MacIntyre argues that “neither the modern state nor the modern family can supply that kind of political and social association that is needed.”[@macintyre1999dependent 9] 

How do the arguments of *After Virtue* connect to these points? We may fairly draw this connection: since human beings are animals, social animals, and social practically-reasoning animals, our account of ends and the virtues that enable them must be sensitive to all three of these points. 

Whatever definition of virtue we settle on will generate a “list” of virtues. Whatever virtues are included on the list had better not exclude virtues that make human life possible; it had better not exclude (as Aristotle did) women and manual workers from the very possibility of developing virtues. 

We can see how the structural limits on what it means to be human begin to set boundaries on our ethical theories. Empirical study cannot tell us what is good, but it can set limits on *what is not* going to be good for creatures like us. Biologically, we are animals evolved from simpler animals.[@macintyre1999dependent x] But our practical reasoning sets us apart in some respects. We have the burden and responsibility to set the course for our own lives, and to care for the dependent among us who are not yet practical reasoners or who are no longer such. 

The practice of practical reasoning is a universal human practice. This makes sense of why educational institutions (as one example) are so important. Without them, virtues — and the goods open to the virtuous — are liable to remain unavailable to many. Vices harm the dependent and restrict them from becoming independent practical reasoners. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. Weinstein says that the primary theme of his work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre %%page number%%] In this he defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but simply is the domain of *living well*.  *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

Our human nature as dependent practical reasoners also clarifies why prudence or *phronesis* is the master virtue. It complements and completes every other moral virtue. MacIntyre defends Aristotle’s conception of the practical syllogism wherein the major premise is an evaluative judgment about a virtue or action-type; the minor premise is a truth judgment about a situation or action-token; the conclusion is *an action*. For example, “I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting a student’s attempt to bribe me for a higher grade. This student is attempting to bribe me for a higher grade. Therefore, in this case, I ought to do (the courageous thing of) resisting this student’s attempt to bribe me.” Without moral virtues, prudence is simply the knowledge of *what is to be done*. Without prudence, the moral virtues are simply skills or habits that might be serviceable to bad ends; one might be excellent in achieving *what is not be done*. 

The mastery of prudence over other virtues also unifies the other virtues. *Dependent Rational Animals* advances MacIntyre’s virtue theory in that it supplies a basis for the unity of intellectual and moral virtues, for the unity of the various moral virtues, and for unity of the various stages of the narrative of *human* life. The paradoxical notion of “wicked virtues” are explained only with this broad context of human life, and with this definition of human nature. As Christopher Lutz says, “The strength of MacIntyre's account of practices is that the pursuit of excellence in a practice entails the pursuit of virtue, but if practices can be evil, and virtues can "enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to” such an evil practice, and virtues can be anything at all.[@lutz2004tradition 101]

Although these responses to the initial worry about relativism may bring up more questions than they answer, they at least present a coherent picture of human life and the qualities needed to live it well. 

### Section Conclusion

While there is much more that could be said, let's call this adequate and consider some of the responses to MacIntyre's work. 

MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

For MacIntyre, moral enquiry is a practice that takes place within a tradition, a community. It can and should be undertaken by regular folk, not just specialists in philosophy. And the goal of such enquiry is discovering what is really admirable and pursuing it, becoming more admirable moral agents through the acquisition of virtues. Virtues are acquired traits that enable the achievement of goods internal to the practices, those traits that sustain traditions, and those traits by which we overcome perennial temptations to lead lives that are divided, deviant, or contrary to our true nature. 


## Objections 

MacIntyre’s work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.

In the following sub-sections, I group his three types of critics. Then, I articulate and discuss key objections especially from his “encyclopedist” critics. 

The primary objection regarding virtue as he defines it relative to practices, the narrative of human life, and tradition, is the charge of relativism. This is a weighty objection and deserves almost a whole chapter in its own right. 

A related objection regarding tradition-constituted rationality charges MacIntyre with an incoherent definition of tradition; if some traditions are truly incommensurable to each other, and MacIntyre himself is truly situated within a tradition, then writing a book like *After Virtue* which is written from a universal, objective, view-from-nowhere should be impossible. Writing *After Virtue* and defending a theory of virtue amounts to a performative contradiction. 

The third objection regarding teleology and the “quest” for human happiness or fulfillment is twofold: on the one hand, it seems that modern moral philosophy can get along quite well without teleology. On the other hand, even if it couldn’t, then that seems to indict philosophical ethics entirely as unscientific, hopeless, superstition. 

I summarize the secondary literature on these points, as well as MacIntyre’s replies, and attempt to adjudicate the conflict. Finally, I shall close with a reflection on why his philosophical ethics is so liable to misunderstanding and, to some, so infuriating. The same features of his theory that infuriate some magnetically fascinate others and so reflection on them may, I believe, illuminate MacIntyre’s distinctive legacy. 


### Three types of critic

I think it also helpful to group the *types* of critic before stating the *critiques*. The three rival versions of moral enquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. His first group of critics are “traditionalists”,  fellow Thomists or others within the broader Aristotelian tradition. For instance, Robert P. George and John Haldane ostensibly share but also dispute his Thomism. (Since I am not a Thomist and do not have a dog in that fight, I shall not dig deeply into these worries.)

A second group of postmodern philosophers are “genealogists.” Such readers agree with his critique of modernity but reject his solution. They agree that our choice is between “Nietzsche or Aristotle” but choose Nietzsche over Aristotle. Some encyclopedists have even argued (as a critique) that MacIntyre’s philosophy leads to Nietzscheanism. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

But I think to concede this is to give up on ethics as philosophy -- and perhaps to give up on philosophy as a whole. If it were true, I would have to stop writing now. 

The third group of critics are modern philosophers that are (by MacIntyre’s lights) “encyclopedists.” They belong to the tradition of modernity. Such readers (including Martha Nussbaum and Thomas Nagel) find MacIntyre’s diagnosis misguided and so find his solutions needless and radical. In their critiques, they object to the historical grouping of all “modern moral philosophies” together and to the quite despairing treatment of them. They deny that our choice is *either* “Nietzsche or Aristotle.  They defend some form of modern moral philosophy against the debunking arguments MacIntyre somewhat shares with postmodern philosophers. Their biggest worry is relativism about rationality, both theoretical and moral. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, non-perspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality.  Although MacIntyre is a successful analytic philosopher, most of his influence has not come from within analytic ethics. (I treat 'success' as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) I think his fellows have been tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy.[@hauerwas2007 put it this way: A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."] Some have suggested that his theory amounts to an abandonment of philosophy in favor of religion. For now, I would caution against this interpretation. Instead, for those of us who are sympathetic to his methods and conclusions, the goal is to extend the tradition by pruning and cultivating; for those who are not sympathetic, the goal should be to reflect upon one’s own tradition, and to exercise philosophical imagination and consider a vision in which virtues as qualities that enable us to pursue the goods internal to practices, and see practices themselves as embedded in traditions which are historically extended arguments.

### Relativism objections

The most recurring objection to MacIntyre’s ethical philosophy is a cluster of worries about relativism. How do we make sense of this objection? We have to stipulate what relativism is. The constellation of (sometimes conflicting) positions that fly under heading of 'relativism' is no small task. Instead of attempting to sift them, I shall follow Stephn Lutz: “Relativism” is a thesis about the conclusion of enquiries; every would-be knower wants truth, but is limited by its contingent, historical conditions and/or the perspective of the enquirer. Hence no conclusion is *true* in the sense the enquirer wanted.[@lutz2004tradition 66] To the relativist, the knower's individual or cultural perspective is both starting point and ending point of any enquiry. 

In MacIntyre's terms, virtue, it seems, is relative to practices, to communities, to institutions, or to rival traditions of moral enquiry. Acceptance of a tradition entails acceptance of *a* particular definition of virtue and list of virtues; denial of a tradition (or denial of *tradition itself*) entails the rejection of any definition of virtue and list of virtues. He maintains that it is possible and common for traditions to be incommensurable with each other. So conceptions of virtue can be incommensurable with each other. In light of this interpretation of his ethical theory, all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that tradition consider to be virtues, not what virtues *actually are*. The inquirer interested in, say, which tradition is *correct* or which version of moral enquiry is *correct* is at a loss. 

Stephen Lutz summarizes nine objections that might fall under the heading of the “relativism objection.”[@lutz2004tradition 74ff.] Of these, three are simply misunderstandings, three legitimate calls for clarification, and three put real pressure on the limits of MacIntyre’s theory. Whether the pressures ultimately amounts to an objection depends on whether the limits of the theory correspond to the *the actual limits* on enquiry. While I cannot summarize all nine of these objections, in the next section I shall discuss five of those I take to be most cutting. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality objections ###

The set of relativism objections pushes MacIntyre (and us) to articulate more clearly the supporting theory of practical rationality. For MacIntyre, ethical reasoning *just is* practical reasoning; practical reasoning is a mode of *reasoning* per se. "The significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments* p. 73] Moral judgments help us "appraise and plan" action. This move does not erase a worry relativistic morality; it passes the buck to relativistic rationality. The apparent incommensurability of moralities -- including varying conceptions of virtue -- passes the buck to varying conceptions of rationality. For this reason, Stephen Lutz' last objection pertaining to relativism I categorize as an objection pertaining “tradition-constituted rationality.” The objection is threefold: is MacIntyre’s concept of tradition-constituted rationality even coherent? If so, is it clear enough to be an indispensable feature of an ethical theory? If so, then how can MacIntyre avoid the charge of relativism at this level? 

Here is a reason to think his tradition-constituted theory of rationality is incoherent. Varying traditions can disagree about a proposition P. Perhaps tradition A finds P true and B finds it false, on best evidence and sufficient reflection. But incommensurable traditions disagree about the standards (say, S1 and S2) by which to judge the truth and even the rationality of other traditions. So A finds P true and rational (by S1) while B finds P false and irrational (by S2). They genuinely disagree. And A judges B to be irrational (since they deny that P) while B returns the favor (since A affirms that P). 

According to MacIntyre's account of how members of a tradition undergo epistemological crisis and begin to examine the resources of rival traditions, we tell a little story of Annabelle. Annabelle is member of tradition A discovers problems with her own tradition. Let's imagine that P entails both (Q and ~Q). She cannot deny P nor can she affirm the contradiction. (Suppose that by A's standards of rationality, S1 contradictory propositions cannot both be true in the same sense.) After some searching about, she concludes she cannot solve the problem and cannot even discover the rational resources with which to solve them. Being passingly familiar with tradition B, she becomes curious why her friends who belong to that tradition deny P and exercises her philosophical imagination to begin to see B "from within." Tradition B is compelling, since it denies that P. She "converts" traditions. However, there is a problem with tradition B, and that is that the standard of rationality of B (S2) allows its adherents to affirm a contradiction. So now, even though Annabelle left A to avoid having to affirm a contradiction (by her standard of rationality S1) now that she has joined B she no longer sees it as irrational to affirm the contradiction (by her new standard of rationality S2). This is surely an odd conclusion. 

A second variation on the same problem is this: how would a born-and-raised member of tradition B, affirming S2, ever come to epistemological crisis? Discontentment with contradictions is not available to B members *ex hypothesi*. They do not see affirming a contradiction as irrational. Their tradition can bear a hundred instances of (Q and ~Q).

The odd conclusion of this thought experiment is a dilemma: either such nonsense is possible, or embracing the law of non-contradiction is a universal standard of rationality in every tradition. The latter option seems to indicate that traditions A and B are *not* actually incommensurable, since they share one rather substantial presupposition. The flow of members from one to the other is intelligible. The former option allows A and B to be incommensurable, but seems to freeze members in their own tradition. Members of A would have no (rational) justification for joining B, while members of B would have no (rational) justification for leaving B. 

### *Telos* objections###

The third and final major objection I shall consider pertains to teleology. I hope my summary above was adequate to demonstrate MacIntyre's case for rejecting the modern encyclopedist tradition and for returning, instead, to the Aristotelian tradition is predicated on the importance of retaining *telos* and the disastrous consequences of excising *telos* from our understanding of ourselves, our practices, our lives, and our traditions. 

This constellation of objections is so powerful -- and the prejudices and misconceptions surrounding teleology are so thick --  I shall need more than the sections in this chapter to fully respond to it. I think an adequate response can, ultimately, be made. But philosophers' opposition to some forms of teleology is visceral opposition. It will take some philosophical digging around in the structural foundations of our thinking to make progress.  

Notwithstanding the general difficulty of this objection, in this chapter I shall present two initial forms that are especially problematic for MacIntyre's narrative. MacIntyre has it that modern moral philosophy surgically excised *telos* from natural science, psychology, and ethics. So the first form is this objection is to deny that narrative. 

Perhaps modern moral philosophy is not so anti-teleological as all that. Kant's categorical imperative, much vaunted for its austere duty for the sake of duty, is actually aimed at perfection.[@ward1971kant] Keith Ward argued with some impatience almost 40 years ago (10 years before *After Virtue*'s first edition) that Kant should not be interpreted as commending duty as some abstract, context-free obligation. He says: 

&gt;Kant's position is not merely that one must conceive oneself as setting up a purposive order of Nature, according to universal laws, as though one could arbitrarily choose anything whatsoever as one's purpose. One can see this if one takes Kant's list of examples of moral duties in the *Metaphysic of Morals* [sic]. Masturbation is against the *purposes of Nature*, in forming the sexual organs; suicide contravenes *Nature's purpose* in establishing self-love in order to preserve life... Finally, "holiness of will" must be pursued, as this expresses the absolute worth of the human person, in its freedom from sensuous impulses and its transcendence of Nature.[@ward1971kant 341] 

A second iteration of the same objection in its first form is that it seems that consequentialism is teleological in a more plausible sense of *telos*. For consequences are *ends* of actions. I go to work *in order to* earn a paycheck at the end of the month; the consequence (my paycheck) is the goal or purpose or point of the action (going to work). So perhaps virtue ethics can be synthesized with consequentialism. 

Furthermore, Cummiskey has argued that Kant can be understood as a consequentialist of sorts.[@cummiskey1996kantian] The proposal is that Kant's *justification* for moral normative principles was a brute, formal, categorical imperative, but the *content* of such normative principles included agents and the goods they aim to attain. Happiness can be valued as an imperfect duty, though rational agency must be valued as a perfect duty. Without entering into all the interesting details at this juncture, the thought is that perhaps a (thoroughly modern) moral philosophy like deontology can be synthesized with natural teleology. 

A second form of this objection about teleology is that ethics can get along well enough without intrinsic *teloi*. The moral law *by itself* guides or forms our actions without a natural *telos* performing that function. For example, Christine Korsgaard's "Authority of Reflection"[@korsgaard1996authority] builds a case that human autonomy -- the ability to be a law to oneself -- is the source of normative authority. How does this work? My own identity as a human being obligates me to behave morally. She argues that "autonomy is the source of obligation" and that "we have *moral* obligations... to humanity as such."[@korsgaard1996authority 93] Because I am self-reflective, I am accountable for what I do. Also because I am self-reflective, I have a self-conception. She says the "thinking self" regulates the "acting self." Korsgaard's notion of practical identity is that we assume identities such as human being, child, parent, teacher, etc. Each identity is functional; it grounds obligations. If I am really to be a teacher, I must show up for class. If I really am to be a parent, I must feed and educate my child. Practical identities may be more or less contingent. All of us are children; not all of us educators. At least one practical identity is necessary. That is our practical identity *as humans*. Humans "need to have practical conceptions of our identity in order to act and live."[@korsgaard1996authority 106] The fact is, we do act and live. Therefore we do have a moral identity. Put another way, she says: “Rational action is possible only if human beings find their own humanity to be valuable.”[@korsgaard1996authority 106] The moral identity is one in which I take up a viewpoint as a member of the "Kingdom of Ends", the community of those who also have a moral identity. So the moral law delivers content-full moral duties derived from my own autonomously legislated rules prescribed by my valuing humanity; these rules are not teleological in that they require any future fulfillment of an end to validate them. 

The point of these objections is to push back on MacIntyre's narrative in which our modern liberal tradition excised *telos*. Either we did not do so, or (even if we did) we could get along without it. 

These three objections -- from relativism, about the concept of tradition, and about teleology -- are some of the most telling against MacIntyre's theory. In the next section I shall attempt a rebuttal of each one. I shall close with a discussion of MacIntyre's influence and why, I think, his theories are so polarizing.

## Discussion

Jonathan Swift was rightly comforted at being considered a giant in Lilliput but a midget in Brobdingnag;[@swift1965gulliver Part I, chapter 2 and Part II, chapter 1] the compresence of opposite insults is a good indicator that he was a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is pejoratively called a rationalist by the fideist and a fideist by the rationalists; he is called a progressive by traditionalists and a traditionalist by progressives; he is called far too liberal by conservatives and far too conservative by liberals. To quote Swift: "Philosophers are in the right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise than by Comparison."

In order to address the three major objections above, I need to do a bit more work to clear away misunderstandings. To this end, I shall briefly summarize Lutz' discussion of six misguided criticisms before addressing more robust objections pertaining to relativism, tradition-constituted rationality, and teleology below. 

#### Feldmen ####

The first, that of of Susan Feldman[@feldman1986objectivity] misinterprets MacIntyre’s project as a failed and incoherent attempt to resolve factious, subjective ethical disputes by judging them from an abstract, objective, ideal observer. But MacIntyre never explicitly presents his theory as an ideal observer theory; rather, he explicitly denies it. The ideal observer would have to *begin* the enquiry from the view from nowhere, which is impossible for us. MacIntyre just is not building -- not even *attempting* to build -- a procedural meta-ethics with which to adjudicate otherwise intractable normative disagreements. 

#### Wachbroit ####

A second criticism is from Robet Wachbroit.  MacIntyre himself responded to Wachbroit in the second edition of *After Virtue*.[@wachbroit1984relativism] Wachbroit's worry is about the fundamental plurality of rationalities. He thinks MacIntyre faces a dilemma. Either MacIntyre himself writes from the view from nowhere, the Enlightenment objectivity, the archimedean point, or he writes from within the Aristotelian tradition. MacIntyre seems to get caught in this dilemma in sentences like these: "It scarcely needs repeating that it is the central thesis of *After Virtue* that the Aristotelian moral tradition is the best example we possess of a tradition whose adherents are entitled to a high measure of confidence in its epistemological and moral resources."[@macintyre1984after 277] To whom does that 'we' refer? The dilemma, again, is that either 'we' are the Enlightened modern liberals or 'we' are the dyed-in-the-wool Aristotelians. On the first horn, if he writes from the view-from-nowhere, then MacIntyre is simply a modern meta-ethicist writing modern meta-ethics. He is criticizing liberalism from within the liberal tradition; he is borrowing the resources of the liberal definition of rationality to posit a theory in which no one definition of rationality has the resources to write books like *After Virtue*. On the second horn, if 'we' are card-carrying Aristotelians, it is trivial and almost tautologous to assert that 'we' take a high measure of confidence in Aristotelianism's epistemological and moral resources. Of course 'we' do! That kind of heady confidence that 'we' are up to standards arises within *each* tradition according to *that* tradition's own standards. 

Wachbroit misunderstands MacIntyre's theory ever so slightly here. MacIntyre can run through the horns of the dilemma. The 'we' need not be an ideal observer from a God's-eye point of view nor an Aristotelian already subsumed in the Aristotelian tradition. The 'we' can be those of us within broader western culture who have faced or might face the same kind of epistemological crisis that lead MacIntyre (and others) to critically evaluate the present state of western culture. The adherent of liberalism and the adherent of Aristotelianism share a common social, historical, and traditional root. Without too much difficulty, they can learn each other's conceptual vocabulary as a 'second language'. By self-reflecting upon the Enlightenment "branch" of the broader western tradition, and by facing up to its inadequacies and epistemological inconsistencies, the liberal adherent can test for him or herself whether the Aristotelian tradition has more resources for solving problems that are problems *by liberalism's own lights*. If, as MacIntyre did, such a person discovers that the Aristotelian has more resources for solving those problems, he or she might make rejoin with that older but no less thriving tradition. 

#### Colby Objection ####

Mark Colby misunderstands MacIntyre's project as an attempt to develop a new, objective criterion of truth that will solve the problem of epistemological crisis, regardless of one's tradition. On Colby's reading, MacIntyre is a kind of pragmatist, where the truth is just the conclusion of a certain sort of rational enquiry. But MacIntyre denies this. The test of a traditon's rationality is its adequation to reality. Lutz illustrates this with the example of astronomy. 

&gt; Ptolemaic astronomy lasted 1000 years because it solves a set of astronomical problems better than any of its opponents, including the heliocentric models of Aristarchus and Copernicus. Nevertheless, it did not adequately characterize the true nature of planetary motion and so under close evaluation it was plagued by inefficiencies that lead its adherents into a epistemological crisis. The theory that overcame Ptolemaic astronomy did so because it solved the astronomical problems or adequately than the Ptolemaic model, and it was confirmed by its predictive capacity. The fact that Kepler's astronomical model once subsumed into Newtonian physics, could predict novel facts provided confirmation that it was not only a clever description of a puzzling phenomenon, but a more adequate characterization of its object: the true nature of planetary motion.
&gt; what counts as progressiveness in the epistemological crisis resolution is improved adequacy to truths, but it pissed him logical crises only rise *within* traditions. Ptolemaic astronomers overcame *their* epistemological crisis when they abandoned *their own* geocentric beliefs Intertraditional considerations arise only when the adherents of one tradition are able to recongize in the resources of another tradition a more adequate solution to their own epistemological crisis. So progressiveness in epistemological crisis resolution cannot function as an intertraditional norm of rationality. This is no challenge to MacIntyre, however, because MacIntyre does not envision epistemological crisis as a tool for comparative ethics or meta-ethics.[@lutz2004tradition 91]

As I understand Lutz' point here, Colby is conflating the attempt of an inquirer *within* a tradition to resolve his or her epistemological crisis through examining the resources of a rival tradition with the attempt of an inquirier *outside* both traditions to resolve "epistemological crisis" per se by developing an intertraditional or trans-traditional criterion of adequacy. MacIntyre thinks the former is possible (and happens often) but that the latter is impossible. 

#### Roque Objection ####

Alicia Juarrero Roque surfaces another possible misinterpretation. MacIntyre claims that "comparison" between traditions is possible for an inquirer. But it is not possible by the attainment of an objective, context-free stance. Rather, each inquirier acquires a conceptual framework from his own tradition -- this is like a "first language." But each inquirer has the capacity to learn a "second first language". We can learn another conceptual framework philosophical imagination, through taking it *as if true* even before affirming it *as true*. Why do this? Usually because the inquirer's own tradition has failed him; he sees its inadequacies, he sees its problems and contradictions, he sees that it fails to live up to its own standards. MacIntyre describes what "rare gift of empathy" that this "philosophical imagination"[ makes possible: “…understand the theses, arguments, and concepts of their rival in such a way that they are able to view themselves from such an alien standpoint and to re-characterize their own beliefs in an appropriate manner from the alien perspective."[@macintyre1988whose 167]

Roque's worry is that the capacity for learning a second first language is an innate, rational capacity that *all people share.* If so, then belief in such a capacity contradicts the definition of tradition-constituted rationality. If not, then the absence of such a capacity renders tradition comparison impossible. MacIntyre's response is flatly to deny this interpretation of his work. The "capacity" to learn another tradition as a "second first language" is a "rare gift of empathy" and in no way part of a supposed bundle of innate capacities. This rebuttal does not make such a capacity unproblematic; we still might wonder whether, for an given inquirer, that inquirer's estimation that he possesses the gift of empathy and philosophical imagination isn't just a re-statement of the trivial thought, "I think I am right."

### Reply to relativism 1 -- relative rationality, absolute truth

Even with all these clarifications made, some critics still worry that MacIntyre is ultimately espousing a relativistic theory. He denies the charge of relativism.  He disagrees with, say, Rorty's claim that "there is nothing to be said about either truth or rationality apart from descriptions of the familiar procedures of justification which a given society—ours—uses in one or another area of inquiry."[@rorty1991objectivity] 

But MacIntyre accepts -- indeed, argues for -- a certain truth within relativism. That truth is that every enquirer seeks the conclusion of the enquiry at a particular time and place, within a particular social setting, within a language, and within a tradition. Following Lutz, we can say that MacIntyre accepts “relativity”. Relativity (a term borrowed from Michael Krausz[@krausz1984relativism]) is a thesis about *the condition of enquiry.* It is not a thesis about the *conclusion of enquiry.* Lutz approves of Mark Colby's statement that "argumentative situatedness is inescapable."[@lutz2004tradition 89] However such relative situatedness is compatible with objective or absolute or mind-independent or tradition-independent *truth*. 

Returning to Rorty's claim, we can say that MacIntyre agrees that "nothing can be said about... rationality" except what is taken as rational in a given society and tradition; where he disagrees is in equating rationality with *truth.* From the historically- and socially-situated position of enquiry, a philosopher (he argues) may indeed find truth. It is impossible to achieve objective or absolute or tradition-independent *rationality* but it is possible -- indeed, it is the hope and *telos* of enquiry -- to achieve objective *truth.* This may seem a paradox. 

The primary kind of truth we seek in enquiry is "the adequation of the mind to reality." This is the understanding of truth inherent in the Aristotelian tradition. He says, “To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true."[@aristotle *Metaphysics* 1011b25]  Aquinas calls this the adequation of the intellect to the object.[@aquinas Q.16; *De Veritate* Q.1, A.1-3. "Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus." Marian David says: "The main positive argument given by advocates of the correspondence theory of truth is its obviousness. Descartes: 'I have never had any doubts about truth, because it seems a notion so transcendentally clear that nobody can be ignorant of it...the word "truth", in the strict sense, denotes the conformity of thought with its object' (1639, AT II 597). Even philosophers whose overall views may well lead one to expect otherwise tend to agree. Kant: 'The nominal definition of truth, that it is the agreement of [a cognition] with its object, is assumed as granted' (1787, B82). William James: 'Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their "agreement", as falsity means their disagreement, with "reality"'' (1907, p. 96). Indeed, The Oxford English Dictionary tells us: "Truth, n. Conformity with fact; agreement with reality'".]

However, 'truth' is ambiguous across at least two senses: a metaphysical, substantive sense and an epistemological, logical sense. (There may be a third semantic sense.) The metaphysical sense of truth is simply reality. "Truths" are beings themselves. The logical sense of truth (which MacIntyre alludes to here) is the adequation of the intellect to those beings. (Logical) "truth" is knowing the (metaphysical) truth. (The third, possibly semantic, sense of 'truth' would, naturally, be the accurate relation between the content of one's assertions and the beings about which one is making assertions. "Truth" is veridical statements about the (metaphysical) truth.)

If we understand MacIntyre to be arguing or assuming that (logical) truth is adequation of mind to reality, we can make sense of his endorsement of "relativity". Rationality is something more pragmatic than truth, something more like "warranted assertability."[@dewey1941propositions 169] That is, the theories we rationally construct are, for us, the "best theory thus far". It is no contradiction or paradox to assert that our rationality is the best thus far but that others in the future (or the past, or in rival traditions) might be *closer* to the truth. 

We may think of the matter in terms of the three rival traditions we began with. Encyclopedists take rationality and truth to be objective; geneaologists take rationality and truth to be purely subjective; traditionalists take rationality to be subjective but truth to be objective. 

Every enquiry has a beginning and end, an alpha and omega. Liberal modernity treats truth and rationality as seen from a perspective-free view from nowhere as the alpha and omega. Deconstructive postmodernity treats truth and rationality seen from a particular perspective and tradition as the alpha and, therefore, as the omega. For MacIntyre, our contingent social, cultural, and individual perspective is an alpha point of every enquiry but is not necessarily the omega point of every enquiry. The enquiry can, by drawing on the past and revising the resources of the present, hope to achieve a closer adequation to reality. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes (one iteration) of the charge of relativism. The truth can be known from within the confines of our tradition and perspective. This answer, of course, puts pressure on his definition of "tradition." We shall return to this concern below. 

### Reply to relativism 2 - unity of virtue ###

Are there evil practices? If so, it seemed that MacIntyre's theory would allow "virtues" to serve wicked ends. The rebuttal to this charge depends on the unity of virtue. 

In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, MacIntyre explicitly retracts his earlier belief that virtues exist without a unity under prudence.[@macintyre1988whose preface, p. x] The consequences of this retraction, Lutz argues, are wide-ranging and crucial to refuting the charge of relativism. If virtues are unified, then even though virtues exist only in the context of practices, "no genuine practice can be inherently evil."[@lutz2004tradition 102] Rather, practical reason can judge *apparent goods* as genuine goods. The qualities needed for achieving the spurious goods internal to that "practice" would not be virtues but only *apparent virtues*. Now, such a definition certainly seems ad hoc. But Lutz provides a persuasive illustration: eugenics. Eugenics certainly seems to bear the markings of a genuine practice. Its apparent good is the purification of the gene pool for future generations. However, genuine virtues militate *against* the achievement of that goal. For example, Lutz cites a story of a Nazi doctor who had the virtue of compassion found himself unable to pursue the program of euthanizing mentally-disabled children. Even the doctor seemed disappointed with himself, asserting that he "approve[d]" state measures with conviction" but was "too gentle for this work... Heil Hitler!"[@@poliakov1979harvest 186-7] 

We might also recall Huck Finn's internal struggle with his "conscience" in *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.[@twain2014adventures Chapter 31] Huck decides to turn Jim in to the slave owners. He writes a letter outing Jim, and feels much better after "repenting" of his theft: 

&gt;I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell...  

After vividly confronting Jim's humanity, his goodness, and their loyal friendship, he wavers. 

&gt;It was a difficult situation. I picked up the letter, and held it in my hand. I was trembling, because I knew had to make a choice between two things, and the outcome of my decision would last forever. I thought about it a minute while I held my breath. And then I said to myself: “All right, then, I’ll GO to hell"—and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

The humor of this passage arises, in large part, because of the tension between the *apparent good* of treating Jim as legal property and the *actual good* of treating Jim as an end in himself, as a free man just like any other. Huck's virtue (in this case, loyalty or friendship) *cannot* be put to use in the service of a corrupting practice like slave-trading. Just as vice subverts institutions and their worthy practices, virtue "subverts" vicious institutions and unworthy practices. Virtue marks the difference between the coward who disobeys his commanding officer's orders because the obedience would put him at risk of painful death and the courageous person who disobeys his commanding officer's order because obedience would require wrongdoing. Without prudence to discriminate between the two cases, we lack any resources by which to discriminate courage and cowardice, between a virtuous resistance and vicious resistance. 

Some might worry that the distinction between apparent goods and actual goods brings with it more problems than it solves. It is certainly a distinction that leaves many questions unanswered. My first reply is that such a distinction is inevitable and necessary in our practical reasoning. Assume for a reductio that "there is no real distinction between apparent and real goods." Then either *nothing* is "actually good" (everything that appears good is just an apparent good) or that *nothing* is "actually bad though it appears good" (everything that appears good is a real good). But I take it as axiomatic and irrefutable that some things are actually good (life, pleasure, happiness, art, stars.) And some things that appear good are not good: obeying unjust laws, eating unhealthy but delicious food, etc.  Therefore there is a real distinction between apparent and real goods. 

A second reply, however, is that the admitted indeterminacy of MacIntyre's account reflects the real indeterminacy of our moral lives. Consider two phenomena: some individuals and cultures persist in behaviors (that I believe) are wicked and unjustifiable -- slavery, child prostitution, ritual human sacrifice, or what have you. It needs to be explained, from within my tradition, how it could be that otherwise decent and normal human beings could persist in such vileness. The other phenomena is this: some individuals and cultures repent and change (what I believe are) their wicked ways. In other words, there is no magical linear moral progression from wicked to good, in history as a whole; yet, even so, some individuals cultures become more good (by my standards of goodness). How do we explain this paradoxical phenomenon? 

MacIntyre's account explains why vices sometimes persist within pseudo-practices, institutions, and traditions from generation to generation; on the other hand, it explains why practice-enabling virtues sometimes emerge to disrupt a pseudo-practice, a wicked institution, and a corrupt or at least incomplete tradition. The fact is that "many kinds of activities can be, and in fact are considered to be, practices. Some of these may conflict radically, owing to errors and insufficiences in rationlity."[@lutz2004tradition 103] Errors in rationality explain errors in traditions and hence misacriptions of the title 'virtue.' Rationality answers to truth, to the world as it is, not merely to the pragmatic reduction of truth to "dialectical success."[@lutz2004tradition 104] Hence, virtues answer to *what is really good*. They do not merely answer to "what-counts-as-good-for-us", which property is relative to each tradition. 

In this way, MacIntyre escapes this iteration of the charge of relativism, while still explaining why rival traditions differ -- and sometimes radically differ -- in their evaluations and opinions. Incomplete traditions can, and do, undergo crisis. Particular persons within that tradition discover and perseverate on inadequacies within the tradition, leading to an epistemological crisis. In response, others within the same tradition may become willing to examine the resources of rival traditions and either quit their primary tradition or re-fashion it, re-make it, update it, and make real moral and intellectual progress. 

### Closing remarks on relativism

J. L. A. Garcia says this: 

&gt;MacIntyre’s rebuttal is as radical as it is ingenious. It is, in effect, to outrelativize the relativist. Rather than recoiling from relativism, as I understand his strategy, MacIntyre plunges so deeply into it, as we might say, to fall out the other side… Contrary to what he sees as the relativist’s hasty and facile assumption, MacIntyre insists that it is not necessarily (nor always) the case that everyone is so situated that there is no position whose adoption *by her* at *any* time would be rationally superiors to some particular *set* of alternatives…Now the tables are turned, and it is the relativist who appears the dogmatist, claiming to know in advance and *a priori* that no one can be so situated.[@garcia2003]

 This all appears to me correct. MacIntyre uses the genealogist’s starting points to undercut the encyclopedist — a move which implicitly approves of moral relativism. But he doesn’t stop there; he uses all the resources of intellectual history and contemporary natural and social sciences to defend some (but not all) of the beliefs and values of modernity, such as the value of democracy, the value of university education, the value of history, the belief in the possibility of scientific truth, the belief in progress — a move which seems to endorse the Enlightenment and the liberal tradition as against the genealogists. To both, his challenge is to use the best resources of the past and the best rational resources of the present to defend a particular set of conclusions *as the best thus far*, as the *closest* to the truth. To both, his challenge is to defend a conception of morality and rationality *neither* claiming that any such conceptions are impossible *nor* claiming to have *concluded* the enquiry once and for all.

MacIntyre has responded to (and he thinks refuted) the charge of relativism multiple times, in his primary works and in “responses to critics.” Yet for many, relativism stains the image of MacIntyre. Even after clarifying the obscure points of the dialectic MacIntyre does endorse, the objection can be resolved but not finally refuted. I would like to offer a suggestion as to why this is so. Rather, the resolution of the criticism can only come through self-reflection by the critics on themselves; hence MacIntyre’s dialectic, properly understood, invites even critics to self-reflection. This is a kind of *resolution* of the criticism. For, to accept this invitation is, in some sense, to join MacIntyre in the enquiry, which is to either lay down the criticism or persist in making it from a new vantage point within the enquiry. By contrast, to deny the invitation is not *strictly speaking an objection* but a sociological or psychological move, a decision not to become part of that enquiry. This not the “victory” of the objection over MacIntyre’s theory, but a refusal to allow MacIntyre’s theory to define the terms of the enquiry. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality 1 - incoherence? ###

MacIntyre would have us believe that 'rationality' is not a disembodied set of timeless and universal procedures of thinking. My rationality includes whatever standards of reasoning I accept, and all the other resources (facts, authorities, memories) I use to judge true and false. 

From my perspective, and my tradition, every tradition affirms the law of non-contradiction. But that is just to say that if Walt Whitman or Nagarjuna denies the law (or reflectively affirms contradictory propositions) then I will necessarily judge them to be irrational.[@sepcontradiction Do I contradict myself? / Very well, then, I contradict myself. / (I am large, I contain multitudes.) (Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself”); "Everything is real and not real.
Both real and not real. / Neither real nor not real. / That is Lord Buddha's teaching. (Mūla-madhyamaka-kārikā 18:8, quoted in Garfield [1995: 102])] But I wish to go further and say that this strand of Buddhism *really is irrational*. That is, I wish to affirm that they are irrational full stop. I am not sure MacIntyre's theory allows me to affirm that. Unless I am missing something crucial here, this seems to me a limitation of the theory. 

Perhaps a qualified acceptance of MacIntyre's claim about tradition-constituted rationality is that when a tradition does not *seem* share this standard of rationality (the value of logical consistency) I should not be too quick to judge that I have really understood their meaning. Perhaps when I ask them if they affirm (S is P and S is not P) they have a slightly different concept in mind for "not" or for "and." Or perhaps they are speaking of an entity instantiating a property and not instantiating that same property at the same time but in ever so slightly different respects. Walt Whitman may be saying he contradicts himself in ever so slightly different respects in order to grasp apparently paradoxical truths that can be predicated of a transcendental modern man. Or perhaps they are denying both P and not P in favor of some other, different articulation of the predicates a given subject instantiates. In the case of any of these alternatives, the principle of charity recommends I extend my interlocutor the benefit of the doubt before concluding that the appearance of irrationality reflects real irrationality. 

### Tradition-constituted rationality 2 - Clarity of the concept

Even if MacIntyre's account is coherent, is it clear?  John Haldane (among others) questions MacIntyre’s ability coherently to identify what a tradition is. What is tradition A? How do we differentiate it from B? Are two traditions separate and hence identifiable only if they are *incommensurable*? How much difference constitutes separation? How much overlap is compatible with difference? Jewish and Christian traditions share a common origin and bear considerable overlap in authorities, scriptures, and doctrines. 

MacIntyre’s definition makes answering these questions difficult. He characterizes a tradition as “separate and unified when its members or texts have a core set of shared commitments to beliefs, when the tradition is situated in a particular context in a particular set of institutions and when the tradition has an identifiable linguistic difference when compared to other traditions.”[@weinstein2003macintyre 83] But is there any universal procedure for identifying such linguistic and institutional differences? 

The right response to this call for clarification, I think, comes from Weinstein. We should not expect, by MacIntyre’s lights, that there is an automatically objective, view-from-nowhere by which we can define tradition itself. Rather, MacIntyre concludes that “the concept of a tradition, together with the criteria for its use and application, is itself one developed from within one particular tradition-based standpoint. This does not preclude its application to the very tradition within which it was developed.”[@horton1994after 295] This is liable to frustrate some readers. But the alternative (by MacIntyre’s lights) is intellectual imperialism wherein one tradition has the *real* scoop on every other tradition. MacIntyre grants that his self-definition of his own tradition arises, in part, from his criteria of that tradition. Traditions change over time. They progress (according to their own unchanging standards) toward unchanging goals or else they abandon old standards. 

I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. This may not satisfy critiques but it cordons off their objections. It pushes back, to demand that the critics self-reflect and specify their own tradition (in MacIntyre’s words) even as they demand a definition of the term ‘tradition’ (in their own words). 

### Tradition-constituted rationality 3 - can rationality justify morality? ###

MacIntyre's theory of virtue makes morality depend on rationality. This has been a common, but contentious, belief in the Aristotelian tradition. I am indebted to @dandrea2006tradition for his illuminating explication and discussion of this objection. D'andrea points out that Philippa Foot (inter alia) levels a critique against MacIntyre: after all the informative and wide-ranging historical analysis, MacIntyre’s account does not solve the “problem posed by Plato, and never solved … that of showing the rationality, for any man, of a thorough-going acceptance of the restraints of justice.”[@foot1981] This is the “problem of immoralism” she tries to address in the final chapter of her *Natural Goodness*. 

The challenge of a Nietzsche or Callicles or Thrasymachus lies in their acceptance that the good life for humans *requires* some virtues or requires virtue in some sense but their rejection of the “robust concept of justice with its corresponding constraints on action.”[@dandrea2006tradition 430]

One response is this: the question “why be moral?” is never asked in the abstract. Philosophers often pose the “why be moral?” question hypothetically, as if they were skeptics of one or another sort. But such an idealized moral skeptic will not do. And a non-hypothetical, non-idealized skeptic faces a problem, on MacIntyre’s theory. 

That problem is that if they are full-fledged members of their tradition, the “why be moral?” question usually does not arise. There are two exceptions: The first when persons who succeed in sincerely asking the “why be moral?” question who are, by definition, outcasts from their own society. The emergence of the doubt as to whether one should be moral, and the crystallization of the doubt into an articulate challenge, is *a political failure*. The *polis* to which the moral skeptic belongs has failed him. The moral skeptic, likewise, has failed the *polis* which belongs to him. Parents, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, businesses, and non-profit organizations all have a hand in giving each member of the community the tradition out of which the community arises and within which abstract philosophical or pseudo-philosophical worries such as “What does it all mean?” simply do not arise. 

In drawing the distinction between the modern "emotivist self" and the "self of the heroic age" MacIntyre says, “In heroic society there is no 'outside except that of the stranger. A man who tried to withdraw himself from his given position in heroic society would be engaged in the enterprise of trying to make himself disappear.”[@macintyre1984after 126] In one sense, MacIntyre *dissolves* this worry. His strategy is not to give the skeptical “why be moral?” question the devil’s due and solve it on its own conditions; his strategy is to undermine the conditions of asking it. 

The second exception is when moral skeptics *are* members of their own tradition but are seeing the problems within their own tradition and are troubled by a “border tradition”. This skeptic sees the resources of a rival tradition and compares such favorably with the resources of his own tradition. He is, in a word, entering epistemological crisis. And to such a skeptic, MacIntyre’s theory invites him or her to do the hard work of resolving that crisis by examining, from within the context of a primary tradition *and* a “second first” tradition, the problems at hand and the available solutions, working toward an ever greater understanding of the truth. 

For this reason, again, I think MacIntyre’s solution stands or falls with his theory of rationality and practical rationality, which is, of course, tradition-constituted. 

### *Telos* reply 1 ###

The family of objections against teleology are, I think, most potentially disastrous for MacIntyre's theory. If MacIntyre's suggestion that we need to recover the Aristotelian tradition of the virtues is to be taken as a serious plan, then we must recover *telos*. 

The type of teleology the Aristotelian tradition takes for granted is natural teleology, of which human or social teleology is a human instantiation. The type MacIntyre needs to make his theory work is unclear. Is MacIntyre insisting on Aristotele's point, that our teleology is a "given" as part of our biological makeup? Or is he treating teleology more narrowly? Is teleological behavior not a phenomenon of nature but only a phenemonon of human beings acting intentionally? 

MacIntyre's view is, I think, satisfying. We can sidestep a conversation about the broader metaphysical implications of teleology. We know that *human society is teleological.* All the activities *we* do, as humans, and activities *we do* in groups (the Republican or Democratic Party, the YMCA, the U.S.A., the Parent Teacher Association, Starbucks) is end-directed actions and practices. Our social practices *just are* intelligibly teleological. They cannot be understood without teleology. And that is enough to get MacIntyre's ethical case off the ground. *telos* can be recovered by reflecting on my actions, practices, and my whole life. With *telos* firmly in place as in indispensable part of my worldview, regardless of whether *telos* exists in nature more broadly, I can go on to recover the virtues.

Human life is, in some sense, a practice. It can be brought under the concept of a grand unified whole practice or pluralist set of practices. Human life is, at least viewed under this concept, therefore teleological and indispensably so. Iris Murdoch argued as much in her famous essay (1950) “The Sovereignty of Good over other Concepts.”  Even if human life has “no external point or τελος”, it has one from within. We pursue projects. It is impossible, in other words, to bring our own human life under the concept of an event. 

This insight has important implications for ethics, as well as other fields: action theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy of mind, and so on. I shall not explore those implications here. Michael Thompson has explored the implications for “practical philosophy” (some metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and more) in his *Life and Action: Elemental Structures of Practice and Practical Thought.*[@thompson2008life] This assumption-trouncing work is radical not in its conclusions but in its simplicity and depth of insight. Thompson argues that the concepts of practice, action, and life are successively larger conceptual spheres, where the latter includes the former, but where the former is constitutive of the latter. And upon reflection, each concept exhibits an undeniable Aristotelian structure. Modern theoretical and practical philosophies that obscure these concepts or miss the mark obstruct progress in practical philosophy. 

While I cannot do justice to Thompson’s admirable work here, I mention it to point out that MacIntyre’s thesis about “social teleology” — the irreducibly teleological or end-directed nature of individual and group human activities — seems correct. 

The proof of social teleology is reflection on our experience. The alternative to social teleology is fully Aristotelian natural teleology rooted in the metaphysics or in biology. For Aristotle, human end-direction is a subset of the end-direction that appears in all of nature, at least all of biological nature. 

MacIntyre does not need intentionality to be a subset of natural teleology. Rather, he needs his interlocutor to admit that human action is end-directed. We act to achieve goals. Whether we arise from bed *in order to* give a talk, or drive to work *in order to* do a good job, or pursue a career *for* satisfaction and a profitable retirement, we are directing ourselves toward ends. In groups, too, we deliberate about what to do, about *what is to be done*. We pursue group goals. We are directed at group ends. Congress aims to pass just and beneficial laws. The school board aims to increase enrollment and balance the budget. The university administration builds a football stadium *to draw revenue* and to create a football program.  

Once this point is made clear, the adherent of the modern liberal tradition has two options. Either accept it and claim that type of *telos* as part of modernity; or argue that that type of *telos* is non-existent and therefore unnecessary for morality. (The genealogist, again, is free to reject that type of *telos* and therefore reject morality altogether.) I am putting aside genealogical moral skepticism and nihilism for this chapter. 

And MacIntyre's arguments that morality without *any* conception of *telos* has been adequately stated above.  MacIntyre has forcefully (and I think persuasively) argued, virtue without *telos* becomes an unintelligible set of rules or traditions.  Virtue without *telos* literally has no point. A society that enforces chaste behavior and honors chastity as a virtue but does so without any understanding of how such chastity fits into the fulfilled life of a fully virtuous human being and a fully virtuous community will be open to the criticism that such behaviors and virtues are prohibiting a whole range of pleasurable activities.  

In light of these considerations, we should not be surprised if modern moralities have attempted to retain intelligibility for moral rules retain some semblance of teleology. I argued above, on behalf of the objection, that Kantianism and consequentialism are teleological. MacIntyre's response would be, I believe, to concede the point. If Kant himself can be interpreted as a teleological ethicist (of a sort), so much the better for Kantian morality. 

MacIntyre's critique of "emotivist" ateleological ethics may apply only to Kantians or to some readers of Kant. But if MacIntyre's analysis of the problem with modern moral philosophy is inaccurate, his solution is still accurate. Moral rules are unintelligible without an understanding of the *internal* and necessary relation between some actions and some outcomes. Kant himself, perhaps, understood this better than many of his contemporary readers give him credit. 

Consequentialism, however, cannot be made to be "teleological" in the Aristotelian or the MacInterean sense. The reason is that Mill has defined "consequences" so as to be always contingent. For MacIntyre, consequences may be "external" or "internal." That is, consequences of an action may be non-natural or natural. For example, the oxygenation of the blood is a natural consequence of breathing. Our biological make-up determines that the act of breathing and the oxygenation of the blood an organic whole. A natural consequence of holding your breath is a build up of carbon dioxide. Winning a world record for holding your breath underwater is a non-natural consequence of holding your breath. Consequentialists either do not distinguish between the two or are explicit that there are no ends or consequences related internally or naturally with some means. Take as a few examples this statement from G.E. Moore: 

&gt;But before proceeding to this discussion I propose, first, to deal with the third kind of ethical question—the question: What ought we to do?  The answering of this question constitutes the third great division of ethical enquiry; and its nature was briefly explained in Chap. I (§§ 15—17). It introduces into Ethics, as was there pointed out, an entirely new question—the question what things are related as causes to that which is good in itself; and this question can only be answered by an entirely new method—the method of empirical investigation; by means of which causes are discovered in the other sciences. *To ask what kind of actions we ought to perform, or what kind of conduct is right, is to ask what kind of effects such action and conduct will produce.* Not a single question in practical Ethics can be answered except by a causal generalization. All such questions do, indeed, also involve an ethical judgment proper—the judgment that certain effects are better, in themselves, than others. But they do assert that these better things are effects—are causally connected with the actions in question. Every judgment in practical Ethics may be reduced to the form: This is a cause of that good thing.[@moore Chapter 5, Section 89]

Moore is explicit here that there are no acts that have intrinsic value (qua duty or qua virtuous deed); acts only have value insofar as they cause good effects. This good effects are, for Moore, aesthetic enjoyments, knowledge, and friendships. Strangely enough, the same Moore defines the necessary relation between parts and a whole as an "organic whole" or "organic unity." But he sees no organic unity between (some) means and their ends. Some means are partially constitutive of their ends. We might say that the *means* and the *end* form in that instance an organic whole. Exercise *causes* (efficient causes) health; but it is partly constitutive of health. In other words, exercise *causes* (formal causes) health.  The relation between a formal cause and a final cause is an internal, natural, and necessary relation. The relation between the species gorilla gorilla as instantiated in an infant gorilla and a fully grown, mature one is an internal and natural and (given the proper circumstances) a necessary. relation. To deny that there are formal causes, or to deny that there are final causes, is simply to beg the question against teleological ethics. 

I said above that the refusal to treat the means/end distinction as clean and absolute is liable to cause his critics to misunderstand his position. Charles Taylor endorses the notion that “the place accorded the virtues [is] a kind of litmus test for discriminating Aristotelian from modern ethical theory.”[@taylor 25] What could this mean? Behind the means/end distinction is a peculiarly modern assumption that formal and final causes are either not related or not *necessarily* related. There are various ways of cashing out this distinction. In biology, it is the distinction between form and function.[@huneman2006naturalising] In engineering it is the distinction between design and operation.

For consequentialism, the great intrinsic value is happiness, or pleasure. On the surface, this sounds like a kind of Aristotelian eudaimonism. But Aristotle's eudaimonia is the necessary end of all action and all practical reasoning. The proof that we pursue eudaimonia (something vague) is as robust as the proof that we pursue *anything at all*. For Mill, happiness is something too specific: pleasure, or freedom from pain. He offers precious little justification for this. All that Mill can say to the inquirer who wants to hear about *why* happiness is desirable is that people desire it.

&gt;It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?
&gt;Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should fulfill -- to make good its claim to be believed?
&gt;The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness.[@mill chapter 4, "Of what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible"]

Mill's definition of happiness cannot be that thing we all necessarily pursue whenever we act, because then moral rules (guiding us toward the happiness of the greatest number) would be unnecessary. We would all, already, pursue happiness. 

Furthermore, Mill, like Moore, sees the relation between the end (happiness) and the means (actions that bring about happiness) as statistical, contingent, and probable. There is no internal relation between some actions (such as virtues) and the proper end of human life.

In sum, the rebuttal of the “no teleology objection" is that the sort of teleology we need is defensible: social teleology. On the one hand, Kantian philosophy may be able to accommodate social teleology, and so would escape the brunt of MacIntyre's criticism. On the other hand, the rebuttal of consequentialism, is that it has not often been taken to allow for a necessary relation between some means and their ends. Virtuous action both *causes* and *partly constitutes* virtuous character. Virtuous character traits both *cause* and *partly constitute* the kind of achievement of our human *telos* that makes life worth living. 

If MacIntyre is right here, then the project of restoring *telos* should invigorate optimism. Ethics, reinvigorated with teleology, might just be able to escape some of its modern quandaries. And not only ethics. Law, political philosophy, and applied disciplines like politics itself, rhetoric and debate, social philosophy, and others disciplines are given new promise and new hope. 

Though MacIntyre’s theories are built on many implicit assumptions, each of which a critic might make explicit and dispute, the conclusion we have found some reason to believe is that virtues are qualities inherently related to the teleology of practice. Human life, action, and practice are all teleological or end-directed. A philosophical ethics built on mere legalism says that some actions are inherently wrong in violating moral laws, or inherently irrational in violating laws of practical reason. Such legalism runs the risk of ignoring or denying the teleological dimension of practice. A philosophical ethics built on mere consequences says that some actions tend to be wrong in that they tend to produce undesirable or unhappy consequences. 


## Conclusion

### Chapter summary
MacIntyre's work is difficult to pick apart and summarize in isolation. In this chapter, I have attempted to present MacIntyre's theory of virtue and practical rationality within traditions. I began by explaining MacIntyre's unique intellectual history and his unique theory of traditions. I then presented his account of virtue as necessarily existing in the context of practices, the narrative of human life, the self, and the achievement of our as-yet-unrealized *telos*. If my summaries have captured the core of MacIntyre's contribution to virtue ethics, we can offer a few conclusions with some confidence. Virtue is, for MacIntyre, primarily an acquired human trait that enables its bearer to achieve characteristically human goods that are necessarily related to human life; secondarily, we may call virtues or virtue-like those qualities that enable their bearers to achieve goods internal to social and individual practices. Practices are in part constituted by their practitioners — biologists can change what biology is from within; farmers can advance what it means to farm. But practices are also constitutive of traditions. Traditions are, again, are socially embedded arguments playing out over time and across generations. And each community *needs* the virtues. 

Now, different traditions offer varying accounts of virtue and "lists" of virtues. MacIntyre's career has been one of struggling with the problem of disagreement in its moral, philosophical, religious, and scientific manifestations. So I presented three families of objections to MacIntyre's virtue theory: the relativism objections, the tradition-constituted rationality objections, and the no teleology objections.  

I attempted to rebut these objections. First, I further explained how MacIntyre's theory of rationality can accommodate "relativity" as a condition of inquiry without collapsing into "relativism" as a conclusion of inquiry. Second, I further clarified the concept of tradition-constituted rationality as necessarily recursive and thus impossible to define outside of the context of a tradition. I did concede that, from within my tradition, there appear to be no legitimate traditions who embrace contradictory propositions or who deny the Law of Non-Contradiction. Third, I defended MacIntyre's use of (at least) "social teleology" as a grounding for the teleological virtue ethics. And I conceded that some modern morality (such as a version of Kantianism) might plausibly be conceived as teleological in the way that MacIntyre's theory demands. But I denied that other modern moralities (such as paradigmatic versions of consequentialism) can be conceived as teleological in the proper way since they treat the relation of means to ends as a merely contingent relation. 

I would like to close this chapter with a reflection on MacIntyre's unique style of enquiry, which is polarizing. 

### Theorist of rationality ###

MacIntyre is a theorist of rationality (and of practical rationality and hence virtue). Hence rationally to assess his theory requires thinking through our own theory of rationality. But thinking about rationality is thinking through our own thinking. The errors we make in thinking are likely to be underscored by our attempts to *think them through*. The Greek proverb is: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” If something is deeply wrong with the way we think, how can theorizing about rationality right the wrong? The Latin proverb (from a very different context) is “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” — who will guard the guards themselves? I believe the answer to the rhetorical question is no one at all can guard the guards. If water chokes us, there is nothing we can do to wash it down and clear our throat. Similarly, some of the errors MacIntyre diagnoses in thinkers who belong to the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition will be invisible to those thinkers. 

Even if MacIntyre’s diagnosis is *correct*, especially if it is correct, the readers who especially need to hear it will find the diagnosis unintelligible, even irrational. Insofar as the "patient" finds any parts of his theory intelligible, they will seem radical, disastrous in their social implications, and destructive of the very nature and purpose of education. The reason these appearances will be insuperable to MacIntyre’s patient is because the patient is, by his lights, self-deceived. He or she simply denies being part of a tradition, and hence denies having a particular (rather than universal) tradition-bound conception of rationality, and hence denies having a particular, tradition-bound conception of the good (perhaps the good is unbounded freedom to follow the moral law, or to pursue happiness,, and justice unfettered equality). Modernity is the “tradition-less tradition” and hence *must* deny tradition to be consistent with itself. 

But *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and others are directed toward the discontented liberal modern. This patient comes to MacIntyre with manifesting symptoms. MacIntyre offers one possible diagnosis, and the patient’s job is to investigate further. The patient needs philosophical imagination to even *consider* the possibility of another truth. The patient needs patience, intellectual courage, and self-reflection. The patient needs to sit in front of the proverbial mirror and mouth the words, (a) “I am part of a tradition” and (b) “my tradition might be inadequate,” and (c) “that other tradition might have the resources more adequately to address the intellectual and practical problems that I now see are insuperable to my tradition.” 
It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side just isn’t doing philosophy anymore. My only point here is that which side it is is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal philosophers that MacIntyerean-type “philosophy” just isn’t philosophy.  It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian-type philosophers that Nagalean “philosophy” just isn’t philosophy.

Great thinkers — Plato, Aquinas, Kant — have a distinguishing feature of presenting a totalizing theory that not only explains a whole host of phenomena and solves problems, but explain why critics criticize. Great thinkers present not only philosophical solutions to philosophical problems, but a definition or understanding of philosophy itself. They are always philosophers *and* metaphilosophers. 

One of the features so satisfying to adherents of Plato, Aquinas, Kant (I could have mentioned a dozen others) is that their totalizing theory puts agreement in context and puts disagreement with the theory in context. It casts critics in a particular light. This is satisfying to adherents but infuriating to critics. 

One of the signs, I believe, of MacIntyre’s greatness is just this feature. He presents not only isolated theories but a theoretical system in which critics, depending on their criticism, receive a name, a number, a category, a classification, and a designated response. Adherents, too, are accommodated. But to criticize MacIntyre is much trickier business than one might suspect at first. Critics find themselves dipping into one of many already well-poisoned wells, and falling into pre-laid traps. The critic who would escape the battery is more likely to flee rather than engage; but the critic who would escape by engaging and overcoming is liable to meet her match. Again, while this may be infuriating, it is a sign of greatness.

            <Title>2. **Relativism Objection.**</Title>
            <Text>### Objections

1. **Relativism Objection.** 

The most oft recurring objection is a worry about how virtue is relative to practices, to communities, and to human life as a whole. There is disagreement across cultures (even when there is agreement within a culture) about the end of human life, about the proper ends of communities and individuals. So all MacIntyre has done is given a kind of anthropological account of what people from that group consider to be virtues, not what virtues actually are.

Call this “tradition relativism” since it is different from cultural relativism or individualistic relativism. 

It should be comforting to be charged with gigantism of Lilliput and with being a midget in Brobdingnag; it may mean one is a perfectly sensible size. Likewise, MacIntyre should be comforted that he is charged for both excessive rationalism and excessive fideism; for excessive rationalism and excessive traditionalism; for being too progressive and too conservative.

My wife Lindsay read almost every page of this dissertation before it went to print. Her background in philosophy, her zeal for excellence, and (what's more) her natural intellect allowed her to catch more errors and suggest more improvements to the argument and structure than any other single editor. Furthermore, she often made such corrections and suggestions with a babbling baby on her lap or (if the babies were asleep) made them when other sensible folks were asleep. While she may write her own dissertation one day soon, I can without exaggeration say that this is dissertation of mine in many ways belongs to her. In a real sense, I *owe* it to her, who followed me to Kentucky and in every way created our life together while I completed this labor. In gratitude, I offer it back to you.

My late father, Rich Buhler, unbeknownst to me, predicted that I would earn a PhD. He had two honorary doctorates but always underscored to me that an earned doctorate was different. I hope I have made him proud. 

My sister Kristi always believed in me and told me that one day I would be working as a professor. The first person who ordered me to go to graduate school was John Mark Reynolds. John Mark, I have finally fulfilled the plan we dreamed up. J. P.

            <Text>Thesis and Introduction 
Neo-Aristotelianism virtue ethics is the naturalistic ethical theory par excellence. It is a satisfying, powerful explanation of ethical discourse; it is an inspiring, useful guide to living our excellent lives; and, despite objections, it is compatible with all the non-trivial requirements of of a thoroughly naturalistic philosophy. 
Providing excellent arguments for these claims will be the labor of my dissertation.

Importance
The doctrines about humanity, nature, and ethics derived in part from Aristotle are not only significant for their historical place in western civilization but for their contemporary place in debates over moral and normative realism and moral and normative naturalism. Virtue ethics is not the majority view (about 18.2% according to the Chalmers survey) but has a substantial share of allegiance.Chalmers, “What Do Philosophers Believe?” p. 12.  
The “banner” of naturalism, on the other hand, is significant as the contemporary “orthodoxy” of public, secular philosophy.  In a field where disagreement is virtually a requirement, the “metaphilosophy of naturalism” boasts the allegiance of a full half (49.8%) of analytic philosophers.Chalmers, “What Do Philosophers Believe?” p. 12. 
Is neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics really naturalistic? The answer to this question will be highly interesting to naturalists and nonnaturalists in the metaethical debate over the foundations of ethics. 

Background on Aristotelianism and Neo-Aristotelianism
	Virtue ethics has undergone a renaissance in the last 60 years or so. Neo-Aristotelieanism is still a protean concept, but I take it to be a set of ethical doctrines about happiness, virtue, human flourishing, and practical wisdom. 
	Of course, there is a metaphysical framework for such an ethical theory. Every natural object has a natural end or “final cause.” Thus, happiness is the natural end of human life. 
	Beyond this, Aristotle, taught, the life worth living is the happy (eudaimon) life characterized by virtuous activity, especially practical wisdom. The virtuous man or woman is happy, or well on the way (depending on whether virtue is merely necessary or also sufficient condition for happiness). The happy person is not simply morally good in the thin sense, but achieves both “theoretical and practical” virtues (we might say “epistemic and moral” virtues). Calling virtuous persons “phronomos” or practically wise denotes more than calling them “good”. Practical wisdom does not merely denote the knowledge of morally wrong actions one must not do and categorical duties one must fulfill; it denotes the property of being excellent at identifying the proper reasons for doing things, the knowledge of what to do. The phronemos person fulfills her duties and does not violate the rights of others, but also she is well-ordered within herself, and intelligently situated within her community and even the cosmos.  Virtuous activity is a sort of master skill, a skill both responsive and active in turns, that unifies many virtues into one coherent, balanced, musical way of living each day.
	Happiness is defined in terms of virtue. What is virtue? The particular virtues are character traits (like dispositions, deeply-seated habits, or skills) that contribute to well-being or happiness. The virtues are commonly listed out: the Greek big four are justice, courage, practical wisdom, moderation. Alternatively, we might add to the list any character trait that passes the test, that can be shown to guarantee or contribute to a good human life (like compassion? humility? ambition?). The list of virtues is certainly topic of some controversy, but the controversy is or should be “in house” controversy. That is, for present purposes we should focus on those lists that are relatively uncontroversial (does anyone think justice is a vice or recklessness a virtue?). But of course, those who incline toward virtue ethics can undertake the worthwhile task of comparing and contrasting differences amongst contemporary writers, differences between old and new lists, between eastern and western virtues, religious and secular  virtues, and so on. But I shall leave these esoterica for future research. In my dissertation, I shall refer to the relatively undisputed Greek set of virtues, and add a few “modern” virtues that I dare hope will not be stumbling blocks.
	Now, so called neo-Aristotelians have been offering their theory as a form of ethical naturalism. Neo-Aristotelians freely differ from that Athenian whenever his opinions seem plain wrong in light of our modern worldview. But they agree with much of the above set of primary ethical theses. Nature is teleological; humanity is continuous with nature; human nature has a pre-defined end; that end is (something like) happiness or flourishing;  and our evaluative judgments of particular humans track (or try to track) how well a person is realizing that human end. These doctrines together may be categorized as a kind of naturalistic, metanormative realism. 

Background on Naturalism and Ethical Naturalism
	What is naturalism per se? Naturalism is, if it were possible, an even more nebulous movement. The term gestures at a family of doctrines, attitudes, methods, social groups. For instance, it is used to refer to doctrines (a belief in the continuity of nature and the fundamental unity of the sciences), attitudes (a high degree of trust in modern scientific inquiries, an optimism about scientific research into human nature), skepticism about religion (from the yawning apathy of Colin McGinn, to the vociferous denial of Michael Ruse), methods (the scientific methods, empiricism, pragmatism), and even social groups (as a banner for atheists, a banner for the empirically-minded). 
Is there anything that unifies these disparate senses of the term? Naturalism is, I think, hopelessly equivocal, and yet ‘naturalism’ is also a powerful by-word, a signal word, and means something to almost everybody in philosophy. We cannot simply retire it without rendering opaque a great body of literature from the past two hundred or so years. But we cannot, I submit, continue to use it without rendering opaque our inquiries into science, epistemology, ethics, and more. 
Giving an intelligible account of naturalism is something I will undertake in the dissertation. For now, let us be content with giving the “spirit” of naturalism and its contrast to non-naturalism: naturalists place a high degree of trust in the sciences for learning about nature but also human nature including ethics and normativity.  Non-naturalism, which judges that some non-scientific ways of knowing normative facts are available to us and/or that some unscientific entities exist (be they supernatural gods and Cartesian souls or preternatural ghosts). Alternately, nonnaturalists simply affirm that some norms are authoritatively binding, not attitude-dependent, and inexplicable in the language of “natural” (non-normative) terms.Finlay, Stephen. “Four Faces of Moral Realism” p. 19-20.  
	Ethical naturalism has two very different branches, one broad and one narrow.This is the view Papineau summarizes.  Papineau, David, "Naturalism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/naturalism/&gt;.Most broadly, the wider family of non-cognitivist and anti-realist theories that are compatible with naturalism per se, including emotivism, prescriptivism, expressivism, error theory, factionalism.  I call all  these non-cognitivist and error-theoretic theories under the pejorative term ‘nihilism’. Nihilists argue that statements in our normative discourse are either not genuinely assertoric or they are massively mistaken in some way.Rosen, “Objectivity and Modern Idealism” p. 278.  These views I take to be disastrously false. Views that can be shown to entail nihilism, can be shown to reduce to absurdity. Nevertheless, nihilistic views are helpful as heuristics and correctives. The nihilist, for one, correctly identifies the “objectionable features” of normative facts and true normative judgments. Normative facts purport to be intrinsically motivating, normative judgments purport to be categorically binding, and so on. These features do need a satisfactory analysis within naturalistic realism.
	More narrowly, ethical naturalism denotes a family of cognitivist, moral or normative realisms. Some moral or otherwise normative facts exist and so some of our evaluative terms are intelligible; some moral or otherwise normative judgments are true, Ethical and otherwise normative facts are real but belong not to some supernatural or platonic realm; they somehow belong to nature. All facts are natural facts in some to-be-determined sense of natural.  
	The various ways to parse this claim give various definitions of nature and various accounts of the relation of “dependence” or “belonging to” nature: normative facts supervene on nonnormative facts; normative facts emerge from nonnormative ones; nonnormative facts ground normative facts; normative facts just are nonnormative facts differently understood, and so on. 

Metaethics and ethics
	The debate about naturalism versus nonnaturalism is a metaethical debate. The received wisdom is that our commitment to primary ethical and normative concepts (duty, virtue, pleasure, the divine will, rationality, etc.) are non-trivially distinct from our metaethical story about the foundations of ethical and normative concepts. We might both be consequentialists or virtue ethicists but give different accounts of the metaphysics of pleasure or analysis of normative words. This received wisdom is wise.
	Yet the connection between one’s metaethical and primary ethical positions is not random. Matthew Kramer has argued that moral realism is a (first-order) moral doctrine. Thomas Nagel agrees by arguing that the only way to argue for moral realism is to keep focussed on the normative “weight” of primary ethical values — we must refuse to get lost in the metaethical quandaries for too long.  Perhaps this is related to Margaret Little persuasive argument that caring about the ethical issue is (in some cases) not a bias but an aid to seeing the salient facts. An animal rights activist, say, who cares strongly about the unjust suffering of industrial farm animals might appeal to metaethical arguments to defend her normative realism, but her opponents should not accuse her of “caring too much” to be “objective.” If Hursthouse and McDowell’s argument that ethical facts can only be seen from “inside” an ethical standpoint is true then the attempt to see moral facts from an “outside” perspective is not just misguided but ethically risky.
 	Furthermore, some primary ethical theories “fit” better with some metaethical theories. Ethical naturalism of a more reductive or scientific flavor fits best with consequentialism. Ethical non-naturalism bets fits with ethical platonism or theism. Ethical naturalism of the non-reductive sort seems to me to an overwhelmingly good fit for virtue ethics. So combining ethical naturalism with neo-Aristotelianism we come up with neo-Aristotelian naturalism. My primary research question asks: is neo-Aristotelianism sufficiently naturalistic? 

Neo-Aristotelianism seems naturalistic enough 
 The generally accepted answer is yes. Thus, Rosalind Hursthouse:  “Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism—broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being.”Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics  p. 192.  Elizabeth Anscombe who ignited the modern revival of neo-Arisotetelianism in ethics offered virtue concepts as alternatives to inherently theistic concepts like law and absolutely binding obligation. 
Philippa Foot’s attitude to establishing her naturalistic credentials is far more sanguine. She merely aims to account for evaluations of humans as logically and grammatically identical to evaluations about animals and plants. (The influence of Wittgenstein can be clearly seen in her strong emphasis on natural language and her occasional lack of curiosity about metaphysics.) John McDowell avers that his brand of neo-Aristotelianism about ethics is naturalistic, though he is compelled to distinguish between a more reductive sort of naturalism and a more “relaxed” sort. 

Neo-Aristotelianism does not seem naturalistic enough 
	But “general acceptance” is not justification. Some have worried that a traditional virtue ethic and a thoroughgoing naturalism are incompatible or at least uneasy bedfellows. Depending on how we define naturalism, the question can be specified a few ways: Can we learn about human nature, human virtue, human happiness, and practical wisdom (and even become virtuous, wise, and happy) from natural sciences? Are virtue properties natural properties? Are happy persons natural entities? 
	And especially, is human nature continuous with nature? Some ethical naturalists are content to relegate all value to humanity (all value thought and talk) and leave it at that. I do not think this kind of “naturalizing” is in the spirit of naturalism. Naturalism it seems is more ambitious than to be content with just “basing ethics in some way on… human nature.” Can virtue ethics be harmonized with the naturalistic approaches? 
	The worry can be teased out into four related objections. Each highlights a real or apparent tension between unmodified virtue ethics and unmodified naturalism. 

	1)	Divinity objection: Virtue ethics has been traditionally the purview of theists, from the divine nous of Aristotle to the divine logos of the Stoics to the divine Trinity of Aquinas, and orthodox naturalism tends to be atheistic, agnostic, or post-theist (apathetic).  If we come to believe that humans participate in the divine nous, are indwelt by a divine spark, or made in the image of God, it seems that we have left naturalism far behind. 
	2)	Teleology objection: Virtue ethics assumes or argues for teleology in nature, without which evaluations of living things including humans cannot get off the ground. An individual cactus or deer is evaluated by how well it instantiates the lifeform of its species. By contrast, Darwinism or neo-Darwinism is orthodox biology that is committed, it seems, to the view of disenchanted nature as a mono-causal order of efficient and material causation without final causation.  The orthodox “transformism” that has held majority sway since Darwin implies that lifeforms are essentially plastic or fluid, which entails that deviation from the norm may be a defect or simply a new adaptive mutation. Marinus Ferreira, “Reasons from Neo-Aristotelian Naturalism”   Stephen Brown articulates the objection that there may not even be a human lifeform, in which case the basis for ethical and other normative evaluations is gone. Stephen Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue”, Ethic@, Vol. 4., n. , P. 7-22, 2005.  
	3)	Normative human nature objection: Virtue ethics also assumes that human nature or the human lifeform is so to speak normatively loaded. The very term virtue (a cognate of the Latin word for man) implies that humanity is a normative concept; a human can become fully human or inhuman. That is, one can fail to achieve one’s own humanity or one can become truly human.  Some ethical naturalists also put themselves at risk of this objection, when they ground normative facts and “queer” values in humanity as if that were enough. For instance, Hursthouse says hers is an  enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being”Hursthouse 193. Consequentialists try to demystify “queer” values by grounding them in humanity somehow (our interests, desires, judgments, evaluations, natural ends, etc.). The assumption is that human nature is “natural”, so if values are “humanized” then values become natural. But the shoe could fit the other foot. A critic could object that values are nonnatural so if values are humanized then human nature is nonnatural. Quite possibly, humanizing these mysterious values doesn’t naturalize them, but rather mystifies humanity. By contrast, “A fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature”.Brown 2004, p. 4. McDowell sees the parity between reason and practical reason, and so naturalizes both in “second nature.” Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. The point is that if humanity is discontinuous with nature then we seem to have a bi-furcated naturalism that violates the continuity of nature.
	4)	Discontinuity of rationality objection: Virtue ethics seems to elevate the status of humanity above other animals and perhaps the rest of nature. More specifically, it tends to make reason and practical reason “special” or discontinuous with nature. For instance, Julia Annas asks: “Does …[a strong] relation between our rationality and the rest of our human nature as social animals give us a plausible form of naturalism? We might think not, if we think that the Aristotelian form is a plausible one. For it stresses continuities between the evaluative patterns in our lives and those that are to be found in the lives of plants and animals. The fact that we are rational animals makes a big difference…”Annas, “What kind of naturalism?” She notes that the more we emphasize our rationality, the less important appears that which we share with the rest of nature (our animality and materiality). She seems to endorse the stronger form of rationality despite the tension. Stephen Brown on the other hand is willing to bite the bullet that some or all of the normative authority of our rationality might be lost if we concede that humans are really continuous with plants and animals. He somewhat regretfully admits (while defending neo-Aristotelian naturalism!) that his uncompromisingly naturalistic virtue ethic “amounts to a kind of evolutionary ethics and, in the end, is fundamentally descriptive” Brown, Moral Virtue and Nature 1. He notes that the more we emphasize our common ancestry, our basic biological animality and (ultimately) origin of all living things in non-living chemicals and elements, the less important appears our normative rationality.  

	These four related worries individually and together pose a serious threat to neo-Aristotelianism. The threat is both dialectical and rhetorical, since they threaten the theory’s truth as well as (even if it is true) its palatability and plausibility to the thousands of philosophers who are naturalists. (Alternately, they pose a threat to naturalism, threatening to prove it false or make it seem implausible to neo-Aristotelians.)

Three responses
	The general feeling is that there is an inverse proportionality between unmodified naturalism (denying divinity, teleology, affirming the continuity of human nature and rationality with the rest of nature) and the degree of unmodified Aristotelianism (affirming the teleology of nature, humanity’s normative nature, our rationality and practical rationality, and divinity). Therefore, three possible responses to the tension reveal themselves. (1) neo-Aristotelianism is naturalistic even without modification, and so much the worse for naturalism; or (2) Neo-Aristotelianism is not naturalistic without modification, and so much the worse for virtue ethics; or (3) both have to be modified (“neo”-Aristotelianism and “relaxed” naturalism) but a real compromise is possible. 
	(1) The first response just accepts Aristotelianism without worrying about the divinity, teleology, human nature, or rationality objections. It accepts, for example, the following truth claims: we can learn about happiness, virtue, and wisdom (and maybe even become virtuous, wise, and happy) in a manner consistent with natural scientific study, especially evolutionary biology, anthropology, but also perhaps perhaps psychology, sociology, economics, politics.  Virtue properties, when they obtain, are natural properties. E.g., practical wisdom is a natural feature of some human beings; courage, justice, magnanimity etc., are natural features of some human beings.  A happy human is a natural fact, like a thriving oak tree or healthy lion.  Human nature is continuous with all of nature because it is just another animal nature. A person expressing human nature in its fullness, is continuous with nature because he or she is a living thing. Knowledge and value, reason and practical reason, epistemology and ethics, are continuous with psychology, biology, etc. 
	(2) The second response just rejects Aristotle’s framework outright on the basis of one or more of those objections. Those who take this response rummage through the other available forms of ethical naturalism for another brand of moral realism or else gives up on moral realism altogether. Perhaps other objections also come into play: The very concept of virtue is undercut by modern evolutionary biology.Williams, Bernard. “Evolution, Ethics, and the Representation Problem” in Making S ense of H umanity, 1995.  Virtue is inherently hierarchical, and hence elitist, sexist, undemocratic, and so on. Virtue is tainted both by its origin in pre-modern and oft-times religious origins. 
	(3) The third response — really, a family of solutions — finds a compromise. This is the solution of John McDowell and Rosalind Hursthouse. They note the same tension above between robust moral realism that captures normative authority and the straightforward reductive account of nature, human nature, and rationality that seems to abolish it. Hursthouse says, “The pretensions of an Aristotelian naturalism are not, in any ordinary understanding of the terms, either ‘scientific’ or ‘foundational’. It does not seek to establish its conclusions from ‘a neutral point of view’.” Hursthouse 193. This third way sees nature as “partially re-enchanted”. The question is whether this third way is possible.  

My contribution
	I aim to adjudicate between these options in my dissertation. Not only answering the questions in the terms posed, but questioning the governing assumptions in the literature, I aim to sort out definitions, clear truth claims, objections, and responses on each of these topics, in order to  allow naturalists to decide clearly the theoretical costs and benefits of adopting neo-Aristotelianism as their preferred form of ethical realism. 
	Combining ethical naturalism with neo-Aristotelianism we can indeed defend a naturalistic virtue ethics. In short, neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is both an adequate ethic and adequate metaethic for naturalists and non-naturalists —  it is true as a metaethic and useful as an ethics. 

Chapter Outline
	To establish my thesis that Neo-Aristotelianism is the naturalistic ethical theory par excellence even for secular philosophers will require three parts. In the first part, I have to take seriously an apathy about virtue ethics and explain why neo-Aristotlianism is so attractive as an ethic and as a metaethic. In the second part, I shall critique rival ethical naturalisms. And in the third part, I shall respond to the four objections listed above, offer a novel definition of naturalism that allows even naturalist philosophers to enjoy the many benefits of neo-Aristotelianism. 
	In part 1, In chapter 1, I do some background work has to be done to show that building a compromise is even worthwhile. This will be done through a novel presentation of four metaethical explananda we are trying to explain with our metaethical theories. Moral or otherwise normative antirealists will view all this fuss as needless. Normative discourse is not truth-apt, or it is but universally fails to represent normative facts. So some account is needed to motivate moral realism. (Thankfully, I can stand on astonishing body of good work on moral realism in recent decades.) These explananda, I shall argue, are real phenomena that stand in need of a morally realist explanation. 
	In part 1, chapter 2,  I shall provide a a clear and detailed presentation of the metaethical and primary ethical tenets of (my version of) the virtue ethics in question. I briefly tell the story of virtue ethics’ reception before and since the Enlightenment, and highlight some important distinctions among modern neo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists like Anscombe, Foot, Hursthouse, McDowell and Smith. Morally realist ethical naturalists of various stripes (consequentialists, reductive physicalists, quietests, etc.)  will wonder what is all the fuss about Aristotle. So we need to motivate why it is worthwhile revisiting the old philosopher. This account shows neo-Aristotelianism’s power as an explanans, a power that contains rather than competes with deontological considerations (about the rationality of morality) and utilitarian considerations (about the consequences of right action). 
This exposes in starker relief how the worry about naturalism justifiably arises especially in regards to the relation of human nature to the rest of the cosmos. These worries are summarized in my four objections. 
	In part 2, chapter 3, I critique other ethical naturalisms. There are many, but the main options I consider are: strict or reductive naturalism (i.e., physicalism like that of Frank Jackson’s), the scientific consequentialism of Richard Boyd and the Cornell Realists.  I also briefly consider the sort of rationalistic quietism of Thomas Nagel. I shall object to each of these theories individually but also critique them all as failing adequately to account for the metaethical explananda laid out in chapter 1. 
	In part 2, chapter 4, I examine in more detail the “relaxed” naturalisms of the neo-Aristotelianism of Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Rosalind Hursthouse. I show that the problem of discontinuity resurfaces with reference to human nature. 
	In part 2, chapter 5, I undertake a novel definition of naturalism. First, I shall offer a clear and detailed definition of the wide variety of naturalisms in an attempt to distill out the core concerns, the sine qua nons, of naturalists. Since the term ‘nature’ is the most equivocal and ambiguous in our language, this will necessitate a detour into the concept of ‘nature’ and that which often defines it, science.  The demarcation problem for philosophers of science threatens a similar demarcation problem for naturalists, since most philosophers define nature in terms of “what science studies.” So naturalism must remain either as indeterminate as the deliverances of science (which does not exclude the “supernatural”) or must define itself apart from science (which separates it from materialism). In light of this problem, I propose that naturalism commit itself, in light of the past and present successes of empirical inquiry, to the continuity of all of existence and of all knowledge. This commitment is compatible with continuities (like the ancient Stoics) rooted in a divine logos or nous. 
	In part 3, chapter 6, I revisit the four objections in light of our new definition of naturalism and offer a persuasive answer as to whether neo-Aristotelianism falls under those criteria. The conclusions I draw are as follows: (1) I concede that virtue ethics fits well with theism but argue that it is compatible with atheism; (2) I argue that virtue ethics is necessarily teleological, and so that teleology is compatible with naturalism. (3) I defend the normativity of human nature and argue that naturalism must adopt normativity; (4) I argue that virtue ethics is necessarily non-reductively rational and that rationalism can and should adopt this, and that it does not violate the continuity of nature. 
	In part 3, chapter 7, I shall address any dangling objections or possible misgivings, summarize my positive conclusions, and search out any gaps or weaknesses in my arguments that might need supplementation. 

The proposed outline, then, is as follows:

	1.	Metanormative Realism and Nihilism
	2.	Contemporary Virtue Ethics and Four Objections
	II.	Is Human Nature part of Nature?

            <Title>### Origin of Virtue Tradition in Aristotle</Title>
            <Text>### Origin of the Virtue Tradition in Aristotle ### 

MacIntyre revisits the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”: the *Nicomachean Ethics.* There we find the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaimonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Hence our practical rationality is natural even though it is not material. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaimonia. (D) The telos of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaimonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.)</Text>

            <Title>### Telos/Eudaimonia ###</Title>
            <Text>### Telos/Eudaimonia ###

So much for a summary of MacIntyre’s account of virtue. Some further comments are needed to fill out the relationship of virtue to eudaimonia. Talk of human nature and telos are inseparable. For MacIntyre, the loss of telos (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But telos unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear telos is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

MacIntyre’s provisional conception of our human telos is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. MacIntyre is not a eudaimonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaimoneudaimonist; this conception of the human telos is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our telos consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single telos governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and telos comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our telos. 

MacIntyre says: 
&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of telos as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 


These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

He continues with this definition of a *human* telos: 
&gt;We have then arrived at a provisional conclusion about the good life for man: the good life for man is the life spent in seeking the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is.[@macintyre1984after 220]

Hence, MacIntyre is not obviously a straightforward eudaimonist. A cheeky paraphrase would be to: our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human telos (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the telos might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our telos consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate telos of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaimonia.

            <Title>### Theorist of rationality </Title>
            <Text>### Section Introduction ###


While I agree with much of MacIntyre’s picture of the development of western civilization, there is far more in his proposals than I can comment on, let alone defend. Instead, I’ll surface and discuss a few particular objections. 

MacIntyre is a theorist of rationality (and of practical rationality and hence virtue). Hence rationally to assess his theory requires thinking through our own theory of rationality. But thinking about rationality is thinking through our own thinking. The errors we make in thinking are likely to be underscored by our attempts to *think them through*. The Greek proverb is: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” If something is deeply wrong with the way we think, how can theorizing about rationality right the wrong? The Latin proverb (from a very different context) is “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” — who will guard the guards themselves? I believe the answer to the rhetorical question is no one at all can guard the guards. If water chokes us, there is nothing we can do to wash it down and clear our throat. Similarly, some of the errors MacIntyre diagnoses in thinkers who belong to the modern liberal Enlightenment tradition will be invisible to those thinkers. 

Even if MacIntyre’s diagnosis is *correct*, especially if it is correct, the patient will find the diagnosis unintelligible, even irrational. Insofar as the patient finds any parts of his theory intelligible, they will seem radical, disastrous in their social implications, and destructive of the very nature and purpose of education. The reason these appearances will be insuperable to MacIntyre’s patient is because the patient is, by his lights, self-deceived. He or she simply denies being part of a tradition, and hence denies having a particular (rather than universal) tradition-bound conception of rationality, and hence denies having a particular, tradition-bound conception of the good (perhaps the good is unbounded freedom to follow the moral law, or to pursue happiness,, and justice unfettered equality). Modernity is the “tradition-less tradition” and hence *must* deny tradition to be consistent with itself. 

### Audience is discontented folks ###

But *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and others are directed toward the discontented liberal modern. This patient comes to MacIntyre with manifesting symptoms. MacIntyre offers one possible diagnosis, and the patient’s job is to investigate further. The patient needs philosophical imagination to even *consider* the possibility of another truth. The patient needs patience, intellectual courage, and self-reflection. The patient needs to sit in front of the proverbial mirror and mouth the words, (a) “I am part of a tradition” and (b) “my tradition might be inadequate,” and (c) “that other tradition might have the resources more adequately to address the intellectual and practical problems that I now see are insuperable to my tradition.” 

It should come as no surprise to us, if we have come to terms with the debate, that both sides think the other side not merely *wrong* but *irrational*. Two opponents within a tradition can think the other side mistaken but fundamentally rational. Two opponents from opposing traditions more often think the other side “crazy” or “nuts” or “mad”, “bonkers”, or some other synonym for less-than-rational. 

Nevertheless, some (like Nagel) are surprised and perhaps even offended when the religious philosopher (like MacIntyre) concludes upon decades of reflection that his secular colleague is less than rational. No! Nagel protests, the religious philosophers is less than rational — my secularism is by definition an allegiance to rationality over dogma. But Lutz rightly disentangles this web of definitional fiat and counter-fiat. If Nagel’s secularism is a dogma, and one unsustainable after decades of the most open-minded reflection upon best evidence, then the secular philosopher is not just mistaken but irrational. If this result seems surprising to the reader, it is a likely sign that MacIntyre’s theory has not yet been grasped. 

Nagel’s inability or unwillingness to consider that his secularism is a dogma or ideology would put disadvantage him relative to MacIntyre. For Nagel’s part, he *does* self-reflectively consider it, but does not express the further willingness to imaginatively and philosophically entertain the opposing tradition’s account. 

Enormous metaphilosophical disputes are in the offing. One side just isn’t doing philosophy anymore. My only point here is that which side it is is far from clear. Or, put differently, it is all too clear to modern, liberal, secular philosophers that MacIntyerean-type “philosophy” just isn’t.  It is all to clear to modern, Aristotelian, religious philosophers that Nagalean “philosophy” just isn’t.

            <Title>Really Naturalizing Virtue</Title>
            <Text>Our specifically and uniquely human lifeform is the basis of evaluations of individual humans that is both ethical and naturalistic. Ethical, because we are evaluating how well a person is living up to the standard — how well he is living — and naturalistic because the evaluation compares descriptions of how a person is living in fact with descriptions of how humans live in fact. Of course the second deployment of the locution “in fact” refers to a normative fact, not a descriptive one. 
Stephen Brown captures this worry that humans as a whole are discontinuous with nature. 
“So it seems, pace naturalism, that human beings are not merely different in degree from other species of living thing but other in kind. This otherness, it would seem, might be so great as to render the explanatory-evaluative structure of naturalized virtue ethics impotent when referring to human beings qua human beings. Thus, there is no identity of structure between our evaluations of plants and animals qua creatures of their kind and our evaluations of human beings qua human beings.” (Brown, “Really Naturalizing Virtue”, 4). 
He also says:
The charge that human variability entails there is no human lifeform not only flies in the face of the empirical evidence but also violates a central tenet of naturalism: the continuity of nature. In fact, Hursthouse concedes far too much to the critic. Our pride might erroneously dictate to our ego that we are far different from other species of animal, just as our pride once convinced us that we are other in kind from nonhuman animals. Naturalism rejects this assumption, and rightly so. It is a bit much to say that, compared to other animals, “the variation in us is of quite a different order”—except, perhaps, when it comes to setting our own ends (an issue I address below in §5). Moreover, Hursthouse herself agrees with what she calls the “standard first premise of naturalism”: that human beings are animals and thus “have a particular biological make-up and a natural life cycle” (Hursthouse 1999: 206; cf. Romanell 1958). Life evolved from common ancestors. There is no radical break in the chain. The plain fact of human variability does not entail that there is no human lifeform. There is a human lifeform, albeit one that is more multiform in its expression than that of other animals. The mere fact of our versatility does not entail the theoretical inadequacy of naturalized virtue ethics.

            <Title>3. **Incoherence of Tradition Objection.** </Title>
            <Text>3. **Incoherence of Tradition Objection.** A third related objection queries the concept of tradition through which, in part, MacIntyre defines virtue. This objections states that his tradition-constituted definition of rationality is self-contradictory. MacIntyre says on the one hand that, according to Tradition A, X is rational. According to Tradition B, X is not rational. They disagree and seem to genuinely disagree. A member of Tradition A can reasonably affirm that X cannot be both rational and irrational. Now, MacIntyre says that a member of Tradition B can discover some internal contradiction in Tradition B that makes her reconsider her tradition as aw hole. Perhaps she discovers that, according to Tradition B, Z is both rational and irrational. She is disconcerted by the contradiction. She decides to imaginatively entertain the possibility that Tradition A is more adequate and comes to see, over time, that Tradition A’s critique of Tradition B is compelling. The odd conclusion is this: affirming a contradiction is irrational for anyone in *any* tradition. Now, I endorse this conclusion; if someone affirms a contradiction, and they persist in it in spite of repeated attempts to explain to them the contradiction, I would find them not just mistaken but fundamentally mentally impaired —  irrational. But the point is not whether the law of non-contradiction is true and a reliable criterion of rationality. The point is that MacIntyre cannot say so without contradicting himself. 

Suppose first that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational, while Tradition B teaches that logical contradictions can be rational. Then the member of Tradition B that affirms a contradiction (Z is both rational and irrational) will not, by her own standards, see a problem with her affirmation. A member of Tradition A will see the problem (by his own standards), but this is nothing surprising or new. The member of Tradition B has in principle no path out of her tradition, no motivation to see her tradition as mistaken, and hence no motivation to consider Tradition A. 

Suppose now that Tradition A teaches that logical contradictions are irrational and Tradition B teaches the same. Now, according to MacIntyre, they agree (at least on this point) about a standard of rationality. They disagree about whether Z is rational or not, but they agree that Z cannot be both irrational and rational at the same time in the same respect. Are Tradition A and B now part of the same tradition, since they agree about the law of non-contradiction? Or are they different traditions, since they disagree about the rationality of Z?</Text>

            <Title>### MacIntyre's Influence </Title>
            <Text>###MacIntyre's Influence

MacIntyre's work has been influential. Yet he has opponents on all sides. Most broadly, on the one hand, defenders of what MacIntyre lumps together as "modernity" or "modern liberalism" object to the historical narrative by which they (all!) get somehow lumped together by a single (quite despairing) diagnosis of unintelligibility. On the other hand, even critics of modernity who accept his diagnosis might dispute the prognosis. For example, even Thomists with whom he ostensibly shares a philosophical school dispute his Thomism. 

By far the largest group of professional philosophers belong to one or the other of the two remaining rival versions of moral inquiry. And professional philosophers, of which he is a quite successful, may be tempted to reject him because he is so critical of professional philosophy. (I treat 'success' here as a function of how often your work is cited either by defenders or detractors.) "A philosopher, he insists, should try to express the concepts embedded in the practices of our lives in order to help us live morally worthy lives. The professionalization of philosophy into a technical field—what might be called the academic captivity of philosophy—reflects (and serves to legitimate) the compartmentalization of the advanced capitalistic social orders that produce our culture of experts, those strange creatures of authority in modernity."[@hauerwas2007]

The three rival versions of moral inquiry, you will recall, are tradition, encyclopedia, and genealogy. Tradition MacIntyre endorses. But “encyclopedists" dispute his historicism and the implied relativism of ethical theory. These objections see the emphasis on traditions and practices, and tradition-specific standards of reason and justice, as incommensurable with the ambitions of universal, timeless, aperspectival moral truths. A Kantian or utilitarian can defend his favored rational, secular morality. 

And (somewhat ironically) relativists like Gilbert Harman reject his moral realism. These think that his emphasis on traditions is well-taken, and that he should not therefore try to extricate any universal moral truths. 

"Genealogists" and postmodern philosophers agree with his critique of liberalism but choose, in a word, Nietzsche over Aristotle. And perhaps Nietzscheanism is true. Philippa Foot argued that analytic philosophers do not take Nietzsche's immoralist challenge seriously enough.[@foot2001natural chapter 7] Perhaps MacIntyre is correct to set up modern moral philosophies as (failed) masks for Nietzsche, the only alternative to which is Aristotle. Even if the dilemma is correct, perhaps he chooses the wrong side. All moral discourse that appeals to rationality, divine law, human nature, tradition or any other such nonsense beside the individual will is a mask. The only real and authentic spring of morality is, of course, the Will to Power. 

It will be impossible, of course, to do mention let alone do justice to all the responses offered by MacIntyre's sizable crowd of audience members, interlocutors, and critics.  Instead, we shall pick out just a few that seem to me the most helpful.</Text>

David Stove has recently reminded us (Stove 1991), most of the good philosophers writing in the 19th century took it for granted that the world as a whole was in some sense psychic - penetrated through with thought or mentality - and hence that the study of Mind was the proper foundation for the study of absolutely everything. These days, of course, we can hardly take the idea seriously.

The Mind of the idealists was, after all, a very peculiar thing by our lights: an entity not quite identical with anything we encounter in the natural world - and this includes the 'subject' of empirical psychology - which nonetheless somehow constitutes or conditions that world. And the trouble with idealism is that we just can't bring ourselves to believe in this Mind . anymore.

It is not too much of au exaggeration to suggest that what is sometimes ' post-modern' philosophy is constituted by its denial of two allegedly Cartesian principles: the claim that any good inquiry must be objective io the methodological sense, and the claim that the proper starting point for such inquiry is the 'inner? or the 'subjective' world. So in one sense the postmodem philosopher sets himself agaiost objectivity, and in another he sets himself for it. Obviously this sort of posturing is not the sort of thing one can argue about. I mention it only to poiot out that our fugitive issue-the question of 'objectivity' at stake io disputes over realism- is neither of these.

Given this way of speaking, the question about the objectivity of morality - if it is not a question about the methodological objectivity of moral judgment - is to be understood as a question about whether properties like goodness and rightness are features of the objective world which in the most favorable cases we discover, or whether their distribution is somehow determined by our moral atritudes, institutions and practices. The question about the objectivity of mathematics (which may or may not be the question Kreisel called the question) is similarly: Are the mathematical facts -the states of affairs that correlate with the truths of mathematics -entirely iodependent of our mathematical thinkiog, or are they rather somehow constructed by it?

Let us say that an item depends existe ntially on the ntind just in case it couJd not exist or obtain if there were no empirical minds or mental activity. Other examples include states of affairs which, though not exclusively psychological, nonetheless essentially involve the psychological, like the fact that New Zealand is a democracy or the fact that baseball is more popular than sled dog racing. In general, the subject matters of history, psychology, anthropology and the othe.r human sciences all essentially involve the mental in this way7 and so count as existentially ntind dependent But once again, this observation has no tendency to impugn the objectivity of these regions of fact all by itself. We can grant that these discipliues concern the ntind without forgoing our right to the rhetoric of objectivity, discovery aud,detection. Of course there are subtle doctrines in the philosophy of the social sciences that are supposed to undermine this imagery. For now my point is only that there is no simple connection between possessing a psychological subject matter and failiug of objectivity in the sense relevant to the debates over reallsm.

For Kant the empirical world is 'conditioned' by the structure of the mind. This claim is not transparent But one thing we know about it is that the ntind that does tltis conditioning is not itself a part of the empirical world. It is not the object of empirical psychology or personal introspection. And this at least points in the direction of a thesis: for Kant, the structure of sometlting that is not quite part of nature somehow determines the structure of nature from the various relations of dependency that may obtain among empirical subjects and the world they inhabit. Now as we said at the start, the modern discussion is defmed, iu part, by its rejection of this transcendental standpoint. The modern idealist - the antirealist who acquiesces in miuimal realism holds that some states of affairs depend non-empirically on us or our practices. But given the undemanding nalurallsm that conditions the debate, there is nothing for this plural subject to be except a part of the natural world itself. This means that the problem of stalting out a debatable thesis in this general vicinity is if anything harder now than it was before. To put the point bluntly, the modern antirnalist must apparently advocate an idealism that is neither empirical nor tra nscendental: a view according to which parts of the everyday world are non-empirically deterntined or constituted by other parts of that very world, namely ourselves. And the question, once again, is: What on earth could this possibly mean?l4

So we must ask: Does this gloss on the notion of a less than fully objective state of affairs do the trick. Titat is, does the Realist's rhetoric of objectivity, already-thereness, discovery and detection really fail to cohere with the recognition that a range of facts is given to us through the employment of response-dependent concepts?

Our discourse about X concerns a domain of fact that is out there. These facts obtain anyway, regardless of what we may think. When all goes well, inquiry· in the disputed area discovers what is already there, rather than constituting or constructing its object. Successful thought amounts to the detection of something real, as opposed to a projection onto the real of our own peculiar or subjective perspective ..• And so on down the list of familiar words and pictures. The antitealist denies our right to this imagery, just as the post-Kantian idealist would have done. The link between the old problem of realism and the various new ones is thus forged at the level of rhetoric. And the most basic question one can ask in this area is then simply this: once one has rejected the post-Kantian metaphysics of experience with its commitment to a trans-empirical Subject, what can this denial possibly mean? We can epitomize the realist's basic cotmnihnent by saying that for the realist as against his opponents, the target discourse describes a domilin of genuine, ob jective fact. The basic foundational question is then: What is objectivity in the relevant sense, and what are the alternatives? Can we fmd a defmite and debatable thesis upon whose trnth the legitimacy of the rhetoric of objectivity depends? If anything has emerged from the long and noisy discussion of these issues, it is the pointlessness of trying to engage them without frrst attaining a sharper account of what the familiar imagery is all about. This is the question I wonld like to discuss here.

Assuming the anthropologist's perspective seems to me just the right tactic for addressing claims to the effect that a certain class of facts is interestingly constituted by our practices of judgment.27 From this perspective, the only sense in whicb this is true is the sense in which the relevant facts turn out to be facts about our practices- or at least facts analytically supervenient on facts of this sort. To recognize a class of concepts as frrst-person judgmentdependent is in effect to recognize that a discourse that employs them is tacitly autobiographical. When we employ these predicates that seemingly attach only · to extra-mental items like jokes or laws, what we are really talking about is what we would think of these things under certain specifiable conditions. But if we regard facts about what other tribes would think as robustly objective, we seem compelled to a similar view about ourselves. From a metaphysical point of view, biography and autobiography are on a par. Tbe only difference lies in who is doing the talking. But that hardiy converts into a difference in the facts described, unless one makes the peculiar error addressed in the previous section.

It seems to me a very interesting question what to say about the 'phenomenology' of the engaged perspective when the concepts employed are firstpersonal judgment dependent concepts and the conditions of deliberation are known to be 'ideal' . Does rational deliberation involve an inevitable illusion to the effect that one's verdict might fail to get things right? It is conceivable that a thought of this sort stands to theoretical reason-the practice of forming beliefs - much as the thought that one is metaphysically free stands to practical reason - the practice of deciding how to act: That is, it may be a thought that one cannot sustain on reflection, but which nonetheless forces itself upon us whenever we assume the relevant deliberative standpoint Obviously, this requires further investigation. Nonetheless, I am convinced that it does not bear directly on the metaphysical question. It seems to me clear that (a) The facts described by a discourse whose central concepts are firstpersonal judgment-dependent concepts are in principle describable from the anthropologist's stance in an entirely third-personal idiom, and that . (b) The facts the anthropologist describes - the properties he attributes to objects - are, for all we have said, entirely objective in the sense that interests us.

Williams explains this suggestion in more than one way, and I doubt they are all equivalent The general idea is nonetheless clear enough. To begin with, the absolute conception of the world is a conception - that is, a representation of the world. It is, moreover, a true representation. However it is not the whole truth.

By contrast, the traditional primary quality concepts along with the more advanced concepts of modem science are supposed to he available to creatures regardless of their parochial interests, sensory capacities, and so on. In one sense of the term, then, the absolute conception of the world is the truth about the world insofar is it is available to anyone at all, regardless of his peculiar way of life. In Nagel 's phrase, it represents those aspects of the world accessible to the view from Nowhere. So one proposaf we might consider is this: (13) A fact is less than fully obj ective if and only if it would not be represented in the absolute conception of the world, conceived as the true story insofar as it can be stated in an idiom none of whose concepts are parochial. The intuition here is that the real is potentially accessible from indefinitely many distinct perspectives. It is there for everyone, regardless of his peculiar angle on the world. The less-than-real, on the other band, manifests itself only from some restricted point of view; and so deserves to be called, in the Kantiau sense, a mere appearance for that point of view of the real state of affairs that underlies it. This is suggestive, of course. But we have learned to be suspicious of suggestive verbiage. So let's take a closer look.

On this approach, the absolute conception is defmed as the limit of a cerlain procedure of abstraction. We begin with our naive, unreflective view of the world, where we take it for granted that the concepts with which we operate all reflect real features of things (occasional errors aside). We then notice that other people represent the world in different terms, not innnediately commensurable with ours, and we set about trying to understand why our view differs from theirs. We step back for a moment from our naive representation an&lt;J view it along with other representations as an item in the world. Our task is to understand how the variety of representations emerges from the interaction of vanously constituted creatures with a single world.

To take some more faruliiar examples, consider the moral or mathematical facts as conceived by a character we may call the moderate platonist. For the moderate platonist the facts ofmorality and mathematics are irreducible facts about radically transcendent entities - the good, the numbers - as they were for Plato himself. His moderation consists in rej ecting the idea of a special intuitive faculty by which these obj ects can influence us. His view is rather that insofar as we have knowledge of them it is speculative. Our opinions are constrained by considerations of plausibility, coherence with firmly held prior doctrine, elegance, . systematicity, and the like; but not by anything like an encounter with the objects or their visible traces.34 A more peculiarly philosophical example is discourse about possible worlds as Lewis conceives them (Lewis 1986). Again, the objects here are causally isolated from us and our representations. But if they exist the facts concerning them are 'intuitively' as objective as anything can ·be.35 The conclusion towards which these examples point is that however interesting the contrast between the causally or explanatorily potent features of the world and the rest may be for epistemology, it seems to have no intrinsic connection with the metaphysical contrast between that which exists independently of us and that which does not

So far as I can see, it adds nothing to the claim that a certain state of affairs obtains. to say that it obtains objectively. To be sure, we do have 'intuitions' of a sort about when the rhetoric of objectivity is appropriate and when it isn't. But these intuitions are fragile, and every effort I know to find the principle that underlies them collapses. We sense that there is a heady metaphysical thesis at stake in these debates over realism — a question on a par in point of depth with the issues Kant first raised about the status of nature. But after a point, when every attempt to say just what the issue is has come up empty, we have no real choice but to conclude that despite all the wonderful, suggestive imagery, there is ultimately nothing in the neighborhood to discuss.

            <Title>### Telos/eudaimonia</Title>
            <Text>### Telos/eudaimonia ### 

So much for a summary of MacIntyre’s account of virtue. Some further comments are needed to fill out the relationship of virtue to eudaemonia. Talk of human nature and telos are inseparable. For MacIntyre, the loss of telos (human-nature-as-it-should-be) is one of the chief if not the chief error of Enlightenment moralities. Human-nature-as-it-is is a topic for both philosophers and social scientists: psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, etc. But telos unifies human nature as it is with ethical principles and realistic ideals by which we can become something other than what we are at present. “To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive” and yet a having in mind a clear telos is a precondition for traveling hopefully. 

MacIntyre’s provisional conception of our human telos is this:  “The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life for man, and the virtues necessary for the seeking are those which will enable us to understand what more and what else the good life for man is."[@macintyre1984after 210] Our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. MacIntyre is not a eudaemonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaemonist; this conception of the human telos is more vague than Aristotle’s or Aquinas’s. Perhaps it is only provisional because it is so extremely indeterminate. How could it be made more determinate? The virtues needed to preserve the quest for the good, he suggests, may illumine “what else” our telos consists in.  

This essentially historicist view of human life is key to MacIntyre’s virtue theory. To see why, we need to think about narrative. In the minds of many contemporaries, human life is broken into isolate stages (childhood, adolescence, old age, etc.). The human self is isolated from its present community and from its position in relation to the past. By contrast, MacIntyre’s synoptic vision of human life is narrative.[See especially @macintyre1984after chapter 15] Human life is a unity, from birth to death (for individuals) and from emergence to dissolution (for groups and traditions). A human social group is a unity of members, more like an organism than  just an aggregate of atoms.  Narrative is not “disguise or decoration” but an essential feature of the working of our minds and (arguably) an essential feature of the unfolding of reality through time. Narrative is not only a way of telling ourselves intelligible stories about what has happened, but is the very stuff of life. 

The end of our narrative (the terminus) is, of course, individual death. But narratives also have an end (goal). He says, “We live out our lives, both individually and in our relationships with each other, in the light of certain conception of a possible shared future, a future in which certain possibilities beckon us forward and others repel us, some seem already foreclosed and others perhaps inevitable."[@macintyre1984after 215] The unity of that narrative lies not only in our identity as a central character of our story, and our place in larger narrative contexts, but in the single telos governing all the moments of our “quest.” Of course, quests do not always achieve their object. The narrative of human life always reaches its end (in death) but doesn’t always reach its end (in success, achievement of telos). But to see our whole life synoptically requires seeing it as a narrative.


### Aristotle ###

MacIntyre revisits the seminal text of the “Aristotelian tradition”: the *Nicomachean Ethics.* There we find the view that humans “like the members of all other species, have a specific nature; and that nature is such that they have certain aims and goals, such that they move by nature towards a specific telos. The good is defined in terms of their specific characteristics”.[@macintyre1984after 148] For Aristotle the virtues are “precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an individual to achieve eudaemonia and the lack of which will frustrate his movement toward that telos.”[@macintyre1984after 148]

We can see that Aristotle’s account includes these ingredients, all of which interlock with the others to form a coherent picture of a human being or community being excellent at life. (A) Human nature is part of nature; and for Aristotle “nature” extends to include formal, final, material, and efficient causes. Hence our practical rationality is natural even though it is not material. Also, our end and (to some degree) the qualities that enable us to achieve that end are natural to us. (B) The virtues are those qualities that enable persons and communities to achieve their end, which is eudaemonia. (D) The telos of humanity is its (natural) final cause, its end. Eudaemonia is not pleasure, not wealth, not just wisdom, but virtuous activity.

MacIntyre’s account of virtue is “neo-Aristotelian” in that it borrows from but also contrast with Aristotle’s. (MacIntyre, for instance, denies that Aristotle’s virtues are so timeless, abstract, and generically human as Aristotle would make them appear; they are partly indexed to fourth century, upper-class, educated Athenian culture.) 

### Virtue ethicist?  ###

Interestingly, though MacIntyre has contributed to contemporary virtue ethics and influenced many virtue ethicists, he denies the epithet himself because he worries that modern virtue ethics has not fully cured itself of the same assumption of teleological nihilism that plague rationalistic moralities.  

Even so, MacIntyre thinks that "human beings need the virtues" because they are intrinsically good and useful for transforming communities and persons.[@macintyre1999dependent] At the practical level of daily life, a small community (such as a family or town or university) does well to organize themselves around a common vision of what is good and a common conception of what qualities will help everyone to attain that good. Even though such a common vision of and pursuit of virtue is impossible to scale up indefinitely for 300+ millions people (in the U.S., for instance), it is possible and beneficial at smaller, local scales. And indeed, this is already happening. 

At the theoretical level of philosophical ethics, the concepts of virtue, practical wisdom, and happiness supply for moral theory what many modern moralities have not: a clear, coherent, useful, and justifiable theory that grounds a rational pursuit of the good life and resolvable moral disagreements. 

MacIntyre is first and foremost a philosopher of *practical reason*. Weinstein says that the primary theme of his work has not been goodness or virtue but practical rationality itself.[@weinstein2003macintyre %%page number%%] In this he defends the assumption that morality is not a special domain of practical life but simply is the domain of *living well*.  *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* take up themes about rationality per se, while *After Virtue* and *Dependent Rational Animals* follow the Aristotelian pattern of treating ethical issues as species of practical rationality. 

In the following sections, I will attempt to trace in more detail his account of virtue and his account of how virtue and practical rationality are partially constituted by the traditions in which we live and move and have our being. 


### Virtue and Telos/Eudaimonia

With this in mind, the relation between virtue and telos comes more clearly to light. Since not only individual agents but whole communities and institutions (and the whole human race!) are aimed at a telos, the presence of virtues sustains practices and traditions. The absence of the relevant virtues “weakens and destroys” practices and whole traditions.[@macintyre1984after 223] The absence of the higher level virtues, weakens and destroys the generically human goods: minimally, the freedom to pursue our telos. 

MacIntyre says: 
&gt;The virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the charms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.[@macintyre1984after 219] 

The “quest for the good” is necessary but not sufficient. It is good, and it cannot be completed without relevant virtues. And yet there is more to the good. So that first provisional conception of telos as indeterminate may be right. For if a person or community could secure the freedom to pursue their telos, they could secures an ethical and political space within which to develop higher-order virtues. 

These higher-order virtues are the context for and hence limit and guide the other lower-order virtues. Still further, social and political virtues are also the context, limit, and guide to individual virtues. Social and political virtues are “required to sustain the kind of households and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good”[@macintyre1984after 219]

Hence, MacIntyre is not a eudaimonist. At least, he is not obviously a straightforward eudaimonist. He seems to be saying that our telos is to be free to pursue our telos. But this is not quite correct. He concludes that the human telos (whatever it might robustly turn out to be) includes minimally the freedom to explore "what else" the telos might be. It is not vacuous to conclude that the virtues needed to achieve this (extremely indeterminate) goal themselves indirectly make room for and might directly illumine “what else” our telos consists in. It may turn out (and his later writings are more explicit about it) that the determinate telos of a given tradition is a more determinate conception of eudaemonia. 

##### Primary Virtue Objection

A preliminary objection amounts to an interpretive challenge. It simply asks: Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of ’virtue’ is the primary sense of virtue? Aristotle’s conception of virtue is that virtues are acquired human qualities (habits) that contribute to (and are at least partially constitutive of) eudaemonia. Those qualities that contribute to the good internal to a practice are certainly skills, “know-how”, technical knowledge or what have you. But not all practices contribute to human flourishing.  Grand theft, torture, etc., are contrary to other virtues (respect for private property, kindness). Other practices can be plausibly seen as value-neutral (table tennis?). Therefore, not all MacIntyrean virtues qualify as Aristotelian virtues, in the sense that many assume virtues are beneficial to their possessor. 

##### Primary Virtue Objection Reply

Which of MacIntyre’s concepts of virtue is the primary sense? I would disagree that virtues enable an agent to achieve the goods internal to any individual practice (like chess-playing). Those qualities are akin to virtues but not virtues except in a derivative, analogous sense. If I were to emphasize their difference from virtues in the primary sense, I would simply call them individual skills; if I were to emphasize their commonalities, I would call them virtue-skills.  Skills are ‘acquired human characteristics’ that share certain features with virtues: they are habitual, learned, and can contribute to an agent’s character. But they are only derivative in that they contribute to goods of this or that particular practice rather than of the general project of living flourishing human lives. MacIntyre seems to concede this distinction when he concedes that some practices might be oriented toward wicked ends. So virtue-skills are not, by definition, traits that benefit their possessor. 

The second layer of virtue is a skill that emerges within social practices. Skills related to political activity is an example. These skills are not even conceivably individualistic; they are always performed by people with other people within a community. And yet this layer or dimension is not, I would argue, the primary sense of ‘virtue.’ The reason is that communities can be corrupt. An entire social group can engage in a social practice that is itself vicious, that is antithetical to human flourishing. The social practice of trading slaves might be an example. A community composed of members who each have the skill of performing that activity in such a way as to achieve the goods internal to slave-trading would seem to count as “virtuous” by MacIntyre’s loose standard, but this feels forced. The intension of the term ‘virtue’ is partly, by definition, good activities (meaning good for creatures like us). 

So it seems to me important that, for some (such as Aristotle), only MacIntyre’s third layer or dimension of virtue is properly so called. Virtues that contribute to the goods internal to the “practice” of human life as a whole. We must conceive of human life as a narrative unity, with beginning (birth and childhood) middle (maturity and adulthood) and end (decrepitude and death). Those qualities such as courage, moderation, kindness, generosity, affability and so on that contribute to success qua human flourishing are properly virtues. They help us to flourish, they are necessary conditions of a flourishing human person and community. 

So if only this third dimension of the MacIntyre’s concept of virtue deserves the unqualified epithet ‘virtue,’ and if that concept was already explicated in detail by Aristotle, then is MacIntyre’s painstaking construction of a three-layered account pointless? There is a point of importance to be extracted, I think. That important point can only be seen if one builds up to the concept of virtue from (potentially value-neutral) individual practices or skills to (potentially value-neutral) social practices.

#### The Concept of Virtue

We gain insight into MacIntyre’s philosophical methodology by reflecting on how he defines virtue. His account is historical but not historicist; it aims for universality but is not purely abstract conceptual analysis. It is, in a word, traditional. MacIntyre’s definition emerges from history but is not restricted to its history; he does not vow to conserve. Yet it does not appear “out of heaven”, unprecedented, unpredicted, unaccountable, and ready-made. 

There are two ways to disagree with MacIntyre’s definition of virtue. The first is to deny its historical roots. This critic is obliged to enter into the historical analysis and interpretation. The other is to grant the historical roots and deny </Text>

            <Text>Before we unpack his thesis further, let’s look at the critical reception. 

His critics
MacIntyre’s critics come from, it seems, all quarters. Marxists think that he has correctly diagnosed the errors of liberal individualism but mistaken the prognosis.  A “motley party of defenders of liberal individualism — some of them utilitarians, some Kantians”MacIntyre, After Virtue 260. and others who embrace his label (‘liberal individualism’) and definition or embrace the label but disagree with his definition think he has grossly erred in diagnosis. Such a “motley party” might confront the challenge of Nietzsche (and, what MacIntyre argues is the same thing, emotivism) and overcome it from the resources of liberal individualism. For example, Foot complains of the “mistake” that  “while Nietzsche's work now interests many analytic philosophers, one finds few who actually try to confront him” and tries herself to confront him. Nietzsche’s challenge is: Why be moral at all? Why isn’t injustice “better” than justice? 

His followers
And yet those who are persuaded by his account are also many. They are ethicists but also political theorists, social scientists, as well as a very different motley party of “plain persons in a variety of practices, including those of making and sustaining families and households, schools, clinics, and local forms of politically community.”MacIntyre, After Virtue xv. 

Not just ethics
What makes MacIntyre difficult is what makes him admirable: he refuses to draw within lines. The opening sentence of the preface to After Virtue indicates that the book arose from a “growing dissatisfaction with the conception of ‘moral philosophy’ as an independent and isolable area of inquiry”MacIntyre, After Virtue xvii. After Virtue is a piece of ethical theorizing as well as a piece of history, sociology, even literary criticism. For my purposes, not all of these overlapping fields are equally important. But it is important to see the historical narrative in which the dominance, fall, and resurgence of virtue talk is placed by not just MacIntyre but Anscombe, Foot, Hursthouse, and others. So let’s turn to a summary of MacIntyre’s virtue ethical and metaethical account. 

There is a lot here. Fully explicating MacIntyre’s oeuvre is not my goal here. Fully defending his main theses is not my goal here. Rather, my goal in this chapter is to summarize MacIntyre’s main theses, especially in After Virtue, and to examine them for answers to our key questions.  Specifically, I will defend his case for moral realism and for the ineliminability of telos for virtue-based moral theory. 
To accomplish this goal, I be sensitive to MacIntyre’s own structure and style in summarizing his arguments. His structure is a narrative, so my summary must in some ways be a narrative. I see no better plan than to begin with a four-part model of (a) symptom, (b) diagnosis, (c) prognosis, (d) treatment.This model was brought to my attention by Peter Kreeft. 
This model consists of a sustained medical analogy in which moral discourse is “sick” and is known to be so via certain “symptoms” (like screeching disagreement); multiple diagnoses are competing explanation of the cause of those symptoms, and one diagnosis is defended (like the loss of telos). The solution to the problem has to parts: a prognosis and treatment. The prognosis lays out the plan for solving the problem (returning to the Aristotelian tradition), and the treatment is the practical carrying out of the prognosis. Filling in the details of this extended analogy will be the first section. 
The second section will be devoted to abstracting from MacIntyre’s narrative answers to the core Metaethical Questions. 
I shall close with preliminary case for (a) moral realism and (b) natural teleology. These two theses will form the foundation of what follows as we progress toward an adequate foundation of virtue. 



Norm-Expressivism, Prescriptivism, Emotivism as Entailed by G. E. Moore
MacIntyre thinks expressivism (which I will use as a general term to cover all non-cognitivist theories) is fundamentally flawed. 
His critique is too detailed to summarize fully here. Briefly, he argues that in historical context, though it may have begun with Hume, emotivism flourished in England after the publication of G. E. Moore’s Principia Ethica. Now, Moore-bashing is a cottage industry. MacIntyre’s purpose is to show how Moore’s alleged insights paved the way for massive moral disagreement and a mistaken interpretation thereof. 

Moore’s insights  
According to MacIntyre, Moore’s three “discoveries” are these: According to Moore, the word ‘good’ picks out an indefinable, simply property that cannot be reduced to or equated to any other property. The property of goodness is non-natural. It is known, then, by intuition — a faculty distinct from sensory perception. 
Secondly, right and wrong are determined not by actions as such but by the consequences of given actions. Whichever produce the most goodness (and beauty) are right. Thirdly, the goods and beauties to which all right actions tend, the goods in themselves, are the goods of friendship and contemplation of the beauty in art and nature. MacIntyre treats these “discoveries” not as discoveries of objective, timeless moral truths but as features of the particular sociological environment of Cambridge in 1903. Moore was expressing the values of those who already agreed with him and doing so in a way that provided a veneer of justification for sloughing off prior moral culture.MacIntyre, After Virtue 16. % MacIntyre’s Moore is not a proto-emotivist; he is an emotivist full stop. He says he is intuiting a non-natural property of goodness in things, but he is really expressing his prioritization of friendship and the beauty of art and nature. Does he know what he is really expressing? If not, he is self-deceived. If so, he is deceiving us by using language that suggests objectivity when he knows full well that there is no objective moral facts to appeal to. 
MacIntyre argues that emotivism is not a theory of meaning but a theory of use. It systematically interprets moral talk as emotive noises without significance. 
The significance of expressivism and of Moore is explaining why moral disagreement is so shrill but why each side still postures as the objective side. 



Objection: rational moralities are not emotivist!
The objection to this lumping together of rationalistic moralities like Rawls, Gert, and Gewirth MacIntyre defers. 
It is worth noting here that the sequel to After Virtue is Whose Justice? Which Rationality? which takes aim at the purported universality and objectivity of one particular and intersubjective notion of rationality. MacIntyre is sometimes accused of relativism. He is not, however, like Feyarabend, arguing that “Reason” and “Science” with capital letters are just tools with which we westerners bludgeon our opponents. Feyerabend ends up disclaiming any belief in objective rationality or truth at all. If every method is equally useful, then every method is equally useless (in finding truth). 
Rather, in MacIntyre, the tradition of liberal rationalism disavows traditions. It is the traditionless tradition. 

Continental Moral Philosophers were, substantially, in agreement with emotivists too
So Moore (despite appearances) and those analytic moral philosophers around and after his time are, in essence, expressivists. Whether they cling to the would-be objectivity of moral talk (like Moore and Rawls) or abandon it (like Stevenson and Hare), neither can justify moral talk as actually objective and rational. 
Although in a very different context and using very different vocabularies, Moore includes in this broad tent of expressivism Nietzsche and Sartre.MacIntyre, After Virtue  22 %. For Nietzsche, the air of objectivity merely masks the will-to-power of those who are not brave enough to take what is theirs by right of strength. For Sartre, the air of objectivity stems from self-deceived bourgeois who “cannot tolerate the recognition of their own choices as the sole source of moral judgment”. 
Expressivism is the archenemy of the “Aristotelian tradition”. The substance of expressivism (shared by such diverse thinkers as Moore and Nietzsche) is: (a) the failure to ground moral claims and appeals to moral objectivity and rationality in anything actually objective or rational; and (b) the persistence in using objectivity and rationality talk despite its emptiness. 

Social Context of Emotivism
Applied moral philosophy, according to MacIntyre, assumes and enacts “at least a partial conceptual analysis” of not only moral agents and their motives and so on but on their social relation to other moral agents. Applied emotivism is not rational argumentation but either avoidance of discussion or avowed manipulation. If there is no rational basis for disagreement then there is no rational basis for agreement or consensus. If there is not rational means of adjudicating disagreement, then the only means are sub-rational or irrational: peer pressure, mocking, distraction, fallacy. If there is no such thing as dialectic, then all that remains are the worst techniques of rhetoric.MacIntyre, After Virtue  23%. 
In this chapter, MacIntyre gives his account of the “characters” that are “masks of moral theories” (emotivism: the Manager, the Aesthete, the Therapist). And he distinguishes roles from selves. The self that has no social roles and no rational history is like a ghost, an empty nought, a pure potentiality upon which anything might be stamped. 
By contrast, the traditional self is identified by its social roles (brother, cousin, member of household, village, tribe). These roles and relations are not accidental to the individual (with the real core somewhere underneath) but essential to the person.MacIntyre, After Virtue  33. % 
The “emotivist self” is a product and mask of emotivist theory. 
The emotivist self is a total contrast to the older understanding of the self. 

So Moore is just one articulator and defender of an emotivism that had been building for more than a century, in England and Europe, before he put pen to paper. 

The Enlightenment Project and its Failure
Moore’s context did not appear in a vacuum. The Enlightenment project was the “predecessor” culture. The Enlightenment thinkers designed and constructed the philosophical framework for a tectonic shift in moral discourse, and effected the radical social changes requisite to bringing that framework into broad use. This framework gutted the older tradition of its essential organs. So gutted, the older moral tradition proceeded on defenseless grounds that Moore would eventually articulate and try to defend.


Knowledge of each element
Knowledge of human nature (as it happens to be) includes any introspection and all empirical research from psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Knowledge of our telos — human nature as it may be and in a real sense ought to be — comes from various sources: empirical observation of the lives of exemplary people; authoritative comments about our telos from moral authorities, heroes, exemplars; and rational reflection on what we admire and despise combined with idealization of what would be purely admirable and purely despicable. We learn of our telos, in short, by (a) example, (b) instruction, and (c) reflection. 




How did the loss happen?
How did the loss happen? Although in the pre-Enlightenment and Enlightenment cultures, there was a “a surprising degree” of agreement on the “content and character of the precepts which constitute genuine morality”, yet a seismic shift of presuppositions had rendered impotent the rational foundation of that morality.MacIntyre, After Virtue 50. % Marriage, family, promise-keeping, justice are all unquestioned goods in Diderot, Kierkegaard, Hume, and Kant. This agreement MacIntyre interprets as resting on a shared background of Christian morality, social unity, and philosophical agreement… or rather, a tradition that included “its own internal arguments and conflicts.” </Text>

##Scientific Ethics 2 - Frank Jackson’s Functionalism


Frank Jackson is a physicalist, moral realist, and cognitivist (though he laments that epithet). He sees the main problem with moral realism as (an iteration of) the location problem. The key question is how to ground the “meaning of ethical ascriptions and sentences in purely descriptive terms.” (Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics 113). 

In thinking through Jackson's sophisticated and influential arguments, things are going to get heavy on the metaphysical side of metaethics. 
 
Frank Jackson’s From Metaphysics to Ethics defends the entailment answer to the location problem. The location problem is roughly how to locate ethical or semantic or other queer properties in the world understood in reductive, physicalist terms. Where is truth, meaning, goodness? The entailment answer is roughly that all the subvenient facts (of sub-atomic physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) entail all the supervenient facts (of psychology, ethics, etc.). Just as solidity is not a feature of the physical story of a physical thing but it is implicit in or entailed by that story about an interlocking atomic lattice, so tallness is not a property that features in the story about the physical heights of various people in the room but tallness is entailed by their various heights. 

Conceptual analysis is the process of drawing out these entailments and understanding the relation between base and supervenient property. Jackson defends “conceptual analysis” against objections that it is a mysterious search for the a priori or that conceptual analysis was discredited by Quine. 

He says metaphysics is about "what there is and what it is like", not a "shopping list" but a limited list that explains everything else.  The list of basic ingredients ought to be smaller than the list of explananda. 

“Serious metaphysics requires us to address when matters described in one vocabulary are made true by matters described in  another. But how could we possibly address this question in the absence of a consideration of when it is right to describe matters in the terms of the various vocabularies? And to do that is to reflect on which possible cases fall under which descriptions. And that in turn is to do conceptual analysis.”

He is a cognitivist in that hbalfoure thinks “ethical sentences are truth-apt... semantically able to have a truth-value.” (Jackson 113). Cognitivism is compatible with subjectivism, so long as the ethical judgment in question (say, “I like that”) is semantically able to have a truth-value. Since language is a physical tool (sounds and signs and so on) for conveying information, to “represent things as being” this and not that way (Jackson 114). Language — at least, language about contingencies — sorts out possibilities into categories of those that are and those that are not. This account includes conditional statements like ‘If P then Q’ where “competent speakers [say such things] just when the conditional credence of Q given P is high enough in the circumstances for assertion” (Jackson 116). 

In the “Role of Folk Theory” Jackson summarizes and endorses a few folk or common sense judgments about ethical properties. 


Ethical and normative properties referred to by ethical terms like “rightness” and “wrongness” are real properties. He clarifies that he is “not taking a stand on the debates over universals in analytic ontology, but merely affirming that truth supervenes on being, and that successful predication supervenes on nature” (Jackson 118). 

Ethical properties supervene on descriptive properties, meaning that for any two possible worlds if they have all the same physical properties then they have all the same ethical properties. 

The role that “rightness” plays in folk morality serves as a raw material from which to start and goal toward which to strive when looking for the descriptive condition (call it M) that is extracted by the Ramsey-Lewis method. But not just any current folk moral proposition will serve — it must be mature folk morality. Mature folk morality is “where folk morality will end up after it has been exposed to debate and critical reflection” (133).  Ethical properties supervene on the comprehensive list of physical properties in question. 

The divide between “is” and “ought” is not a divide between semantics. Jackson says, “I have to regard the purely descriptive terms as essentially given by a big list of terms that would generally e classified as such, and see the aim of the exercise as the analysis of ethical terms in some way or another in terms of this big list” (120). Moore would object. Moore’s assertion that goodness is a non-natural property Jackson summarizes as the claim that “what is left of language after we cull the ethical terms is in principle inadequate to the task of ascribing the properties we ascribe using ethical terms” (121). I could not, sans evaluative terms like ‘beautiful,’ ‘lovely,’ ‘shapely,’ ‘lush,’ ‘gorgeous’ etc., really describe what a rose looks like by just describing its color, shape, size, chemical composition, lifespan, etc. 

Jackson is agnostic about whether mature folk morality will indeed ever converge into one, coherent, universally agreed-upon whole. He believes it will, but accepts the possibility that a fundamentally plural set of moralities is in fact the mature set (Jackson 137).  


The bottom line, however, is clear: “any ethical way of carving up how things are is equivalent to some descriptive way of carving up how things are” (Jackson 139). This is a strange conclusion: it is in one way too open and in another way too closed. It is too open about exactly what description will correlate isomorphically to a particular evaluation. He has concluded that it is possible that what is right (evaluatively) will have in every case some descriptive correlate. What he hasn't concluded is that what is right is what “maximizes expected hedonic value” or any other such thing. This openness Jackson seems to prize, calling it “ecumenical” (Jackson 142). But I don’t see why he should. On my view, we already know that maximizing pleasure is, on balance, a good idea. Most pleasures are innocent pleasures that involve no corruption. Most pleasures *can* admit of excess and so when they are combined with moderation can be enjoyed. What we don’t know (or maybe some of us know but the rest of us don’t agree) is whether the meaning of the term and fact of maximizing pleasure is identical to the meaning of the term and the fact of goodness. Jackson's conclusion is too closed in that it makes moral progress or moral discovery a species of scientific progress or factual discovery. On my view, we already know what it will take something more than scientific discovery to open new moral horizens. Jackson's thought makes the saint someone who through experimental methods discovered something new about the world, a new description that correlates to a new evaluation. The astonishment we feel at moral heroism is just a species of the astonishment we feel at first learning, say, that sub-atomic particles can act on each other at a distance, or that time is relative to the speed of light rather than vice versa, or that water bears (tardigrades) can survive in deep space. I find this highly implausible. The saint is someone who astonishes us with magnanimity, patience, courage, extraordinary love, and so on — who opens up distinctively moral horizens. 

	
##Open Questions

The open question argument applied to Jackson is fairly clear: even supposing that an action A has the proper descriptive property D under conditions M such that it satisfies the role mature folk morality assigns to rightness, is it actually right? That is, does it satisfy my (or our) assigned role of rightness as we understand it today? 

Jackson defends himself against the open question argument in two ways. The first defense is that mature folk morality is still maturing and so we should not expect it to be complete. Some ethical truths are not extant and won’t be for an indeterminate amount of time. Some openness is to be expected. If we ask him “is it actually right?” he can respond that we don’t know for sure but time will tell. 

Two critical responses, at least, are called for. The first problem is that “time will tell” is not the right kind of openness. As Boyd makes clear, some ethical judgments are quasi-analytic in that they are so true it is almost inconceivable that they should ever turn out to be false; they could never imaginably be vetoed by any future discovery of physics or psychology. In Jackson’s terms, some pieces of folk morality are already maximally mature. The judgments, say, that torturing children for fun is cruel and that cruelty is wrong, (bad, impermissible, unlawful, disrespectful, unnatural, painful, vicious, or whatever other imprecation you like) have been sufficiently subject to debate and critical reflection. Indeed, I would argue that anyone willing to seriously “debate and critically reflect” on whether or not torturing children for fun is actually wrong by that very willingness demonstrates a moral defect. 

A second problem is that the term “mature” is evaluative. When some philosophers define truth or rationality in terms of an “ideal observer” who is fully informed and critically reflective, they slip into the descriptive definition an evaluative or prescriptive notion — that the observer is ideal in a positive sense. Jackson does the same. It would be too crude to paraphrase the notion of mature folk morality as the moral principles of people who are correct.  But there is something of circularity in trying to ground the evaluative property D in purely descriptive terms when one of our descriptive terms is evaluative. 

Jackson might respond that “mature” is only evaluative or normative about intellectual processes of debate and reflection rather than about ethical or practical processes of action or sentiment. Again, as we saw in response to Richard Boyd &lt;ref&gt;Boyd on intellectual or epistemic virtues&lt;ref/&gt;, evaluative terms like reasonable and rational are not ethically neutral. Arguably, they are centrally related to ethical evaluations. It is wrong to be intellectually dishonest. 


Jackson distinguishes what is open and what is closed abou folk morality by distinguishing “general principles broadly stated” (Jackson 132, original emphasis). The normative principles he cites are instructive: “killing people is normally wrong; we agree that people wo claim to believe that somethign is very wrong but show not the slightest incliniation to refrain from doing it are in some sense insincere; we agree that certain character traits associated with the virtues are intimately connected with the persons’ dispositions to o what is right; and so on.” (Jackson 132). The specifics are, however, liable to “a great deal of disagreement” (Jackson 133). 

Jackson includes in his account what I have called the paradox of knowing and not knowing the good. The distinction he draws is that folk morality gives us the raw material, so to speak, of most “initially appealing” parts of morality of which some parts survive as plausible by being vindicated by “critical reflection” (Jackson 134-5). For instance, utilitarians must give up (as an exceptionless moral rule or first principle or quasi-analytic statement) that it is always wrong to punish the innocent.


Anscombe criticizes utilitarian (or any other consequentialist) philosophy on just these lines. “It is a necessary feature of consequentialism that it is a shallow philosophy... it has in fact been the mark of all these [consequentialist] philosophers that they have been extremely conventional; they have nothing in them by which to revolt against the conventional standards of their sort of people; it is impossible that they should be profound” (Anscombe, “Modern Moral Philosophy”). The problem is that we might being “open” to reconsidering an ethical standard that should be closed. One fundamental aspect of being an ethical or moral person is refusing to reconsider certain norms. Anscombe continues, “But if someone really thinks, in advance, that it is open to question whether such an action as procuring the judicial execution of the innocent should be quite excluded from consideration‑-I do not want to argue with him; he shows a corrupt mind.” 

Jackson may not show a corrupt mind, but he does play the dangerous game of reconsidering quasi-analytic, necessary-seeming propositions. But this game must be played by any ethical theory. That’s just the way it goes. He says, “We tease out the consequences of the view or views under discussion; we identify those that seem most at odds with current folk morality— in other words, the consequences which strike us as most counterintuitive; and consider whether we are prepared after critical reflection to accept the consequences, that is, to modify folk morality so as to accord with them.” (Jackson 135). 

##Ramsey Sentences
A Ramsey sentence is a conceptual apparatus invented by positivist Carnap to explain why metaphysical questions are meaningless unless they can be translated into empirical sentences. 
Ramsey sentences take an apparently meaningful folk sentence like “Electrons are real,” empty the theoretical content, and replace it with empirical content that is supposed to do the same assertoric work. 

For a philosopher like myself who has never one been tempted by the charms of positivism — a hopeful but hopelessly incoherent dream that knowledge can be made clear, mundane, and irrefutable to any one with five senses — it is hard to build a conceptual structure on such a flimsy conceptual foundation as Ramsey sentences. But even so, let us take them seriously. 

One critique is that Ramsey sentences do not do the actual work of correlating ethical (prescriptive or evaluative) and non-ethical (descriptive) properties. They just show a theoretical way such a correlation might go. Jackson admits that ethical vocabulary is indispensible “in practice” (124). How does one acquire the possibly infinite disjunction of descriptive properties that correlates to the term ‘wrong’, and how does one deploy it in a dispute with one’s sibling, if one is only five years old? 


##An Objection or Two 

The sophistic charm of Jackson’s account comes from talking a lot about carts and horses but reversing the cart and horse. The true ethical properties make a possibly infinite disjunction of descriptive properties true, not the other way around. 

Jackson’s account points to a correlation — at best, an isomorphic correlation — between ethical and descriptive properties, between our uses of the term ‘right’ and the role, exhaustively described, played by rightness. 

“Fairness is what fills the fairness role; rightness is what fills the rightness role; and so on” (Jackson 140). 

David Enoch objects along similar line.

&gt;“I am going to grant that every normative property is necessarily co-extensive with a natural one. What I am not going to grant, then, is the identity of necessarily co-extensive properties. The common examples that are used as (purported) counterexamples are things like triangularity (having three angles) and trilaterality (having three sides), or the property of being the number 2 and the property of being an even prime,10 or – more closely to our context – the property of being an obligatory action and the property of being such that it is an essential property of God to command all persons to perform it (assuming some suitable version of a divine command theory).11 Intuitively, it seems that these are distinct properties, even though they are necessarily coextensive. Of course, proponents of the argument above may just dig in their heels, and insist that in these cases too the seemingly distinct properties are actually identical (though the relevant concepts may be distinct, of course). And so we find ourselves at a frustrating impasse” 
[@enoch2011 138-9](Enoch 2011,  138-139; Enoch, Taking Morality Seriously, 138-9).  
 

##Functionalism is not Metaphysics Objection
I have long puzzled over how functional theories (of consciousness, morality, etc.) have gotten by under the appellation of metaphysics. If I asked an astronomer what a planet is, he might reply with some examples: “Mars, Venus, Earth.” And if I pressed him to give me not just examples but a definition, he might say “a massive spheroid orbiting the sun.” But suppose I press him on that criterion by citing the 43 Kuiper Belt objects that are massive, spherical, and orbiting the sun. We are still, I think, talking about physical object. He could reply that we don’t exactly know what counts as a planet, but that size and the amount of orbital room the object has between its neighboring objects seems important to our definition. Well and good. 
But suppose now that I ask an astronomer what a planet is and he answers that “it” is “whatever” large object orbits suns. If he said that a planet is “whatever fills the planet role” he seems to have given up talking about physics and objects. Does he really mean that ‘whatever’ it may be that turns out to fill a planet role is a planet, whether it is round and solid or not? That it does not ultimately matter whether the object is even in deep space? For perhaps I could build pieces of architecture or technology that occupy the planet role, and could therefore build planets. These conclusions seem to me absurd. 
The point is this: Either the functional role of the “whatever” is determined in part by the kinds of objects that could possibly fill that role, or it is undetermined. If it is undetermined, then the absurdities above follow, and we have a reductio for the functional role account of objects. If it is determined, then we must give a functional role and a determinate set of criteria about the object. That is, we must do traditional metaphysics.

Outro
MacIntyre’s appropriation of Anscombe’s charge to rethink moral philosophy has set the course for the inquiry to follow. Not only has his theory of virtue and of the phenomenology of human teleology shown to be illuminating, but I have placed myself within the third version of inquiry: tradition. Our task in what follows is certainly not geneaology; it may be mistaken for encyclopedia at points, since we must engage the arguments (and the inevitable taxonomies) of contemporary scholarship, however temporary and short-lived those encyclopedical entries may be. Our task in what follows is to understand and extend the tradition received from Aristotle, Aquinas, MacIntyre, Murdoch, and Brewer and put it in creative dialogue with the arguments of our remaining authors: Foot, McDowell, Hursthouse, Adams. 
Each of these authors has his or her own distinctive thesis and framework. But they all exist on a spectrum of more or less reductive. So before we engage them, first we must consider a lesser-known author whose arguments shall set the stage for what follows. His virtue ethics and neo-Aristotelian naturalism is the most reductive we shall consider.  That reductionism will point out the key metaethical challenges a virtue ethicist must face, especially the No Natural Teleology Objection (which is related to the No God Objection) and that author is Stephen R. Brown. 

Outro II
MacIntyre took and ran with Anscombe’s charge to re-think moral philosophy. His own Marx-indebted dissatisfaction with liberal ideology and his eventual Aristotle-indebted dissatisfaction with Marxism lead him to an unlikely solution: the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. The contemporary moral scene is a milieu of interminable disagreement, characterized by the rhetoric of a half-remembered objectivity and a simple, firm will to power. The two errant responses are the genealogical (which undermines all moral thought and talk) and the encyclopedic (which idolizes and calcifies whatever happens to be the majority view of the present), both of which err in the present by disrespecting the past. The proper response is to respect the past but help it, while recognizing that we are someone else’s past and deserve respect as well as help. Virtues play a key role in the ongoing practices we still engage in, professional, personal, religious, and political. But virtues are end-directed activities at which we can become excellent. Restoring the concept of telos to (at least) human practice and human nature (and at most, nature more generally) rebuilds out of the ruins of our contemporary moral disagreement a possibility identify what and which virtues will help us achieve the goods internal to our practices and become practical reasoners. Restoring the concept of telos restores the possibility of justified agreement and intelligible disagreement. 
But teleology in human practice, even if human practice is the only natural phenomenon in the whole cosmos wherein teleology occurs, demands an explanation. Merely to identify that our activities, communities, and narrative selves are end-directed admits of multiple explanations. It might be that we, like the rest of nature, find ourselves end-directed. Or it might be that we are unique and sui-generis in nature, utterly discontinuous with all that has come before us in the phylogenetic tree and (possibly) on our way to unprecedented and unimaginable heights. It might be that we are self-creators and that, knowing this, and despairing, our only goal is to avoid committing suicide individually and as a species. 
So it would help to know whether the goodness of virtue (in humans) is a human version of a broader natural phenomenon. In that task Philippa Foot will help us and to her we now turn. </Text>

## Introduction ##


The purpose of this dissertation is to analyze the concept of virtue and related concepts in the writings of four important contemporary virtue ethicists. The four are: Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Robert M. Adams. For each philosopher, I devote a chapter summarizing the core commitments of his or her moral philosophy before attacking what seems implausible and defending what seems true. 

### Thesis  ###

In the end, this dissertation defends four claims: (a) commonly accepted virtues of the mind and will (such as courage, justice, moderation, and practical wisdom, wisdom) are perfections of human nature in practice, that (b) such virtues are necessary for human beings as such — i.e. the task of becoming  virtuous is *a categorical imperative,* a perfect duty, an unconditional obligation that also has the best consequences, makes the most people most happy; that (c) though not all people accurately described as ‘virtuous’ are accurately described as ‘happy’, only virtuous people are happy, and finally (d) a second-order claim about claims (a)-(c) that they are compatible with metaphysical naturalism correctly understood.  

The first three claims are liable to be seen by some as platitudes. The fourth is perhaps still lively and controversial. Regardless, there are objections to all these claims. Just as importantly, there are objections to *the assumptions undergirding* such claims. 

My goal is not in the end to uncover any fresh moral truths nor even to freshly demonstrate age-old platitudes. My strategy is essential conservative: to dismantle common prejudicial objections to the assumptions undergirding (a)-(c) and rendering it plausible to believe (a)-(c) if each objection can be either undercut or rebutted. My dialectical strategy is to assume that virtue talk and virtue concepts not only enrich our philosophical ethics and philosophical lives but are indispensable, to allow objections or resistance (even hostile or dismissive objections) to surface, and to diffuse such resistance. 

The defense of these claims, therefore, will be an exploration of three concepts: virtue, practical reason, and happiness.  What do these terms mean? Details are needed, but I thought it best to offer a very rough initial account of three key terms: *Virtues* are positive, admirable character qualities that are necessary for living well; *practical reason* is that faculty of rational reflection and deliberation by which we construct and execute life plans; and *happiness* is quite simply a name for a person (or group) whose life is going well, who has good character traits, has a good life plan and is executing it more or less according to plan. 

The concepts of virtue, practical reason, and happiness are the primary focus of this research. But my focus will extend to include other key concepts that these philosophers invoke in their account of virtue. For instance, *practice* is a key secondary concept in MacIntyre because he defines virtues as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to *practices*.”[@macintyre1984after, 191, emphasis added. *After Virtue* was published in 1981. Unless otherwise noted, the citations in this proposal refer to the 1984 second edition.]  To discuss MacIntyre's account of virtue it will be useful to discuss writings like those of Michael Thompson, who gives an account of life, action, and practice.[@thompson2008life] Another key secondary concept is that of a *human lifeform*, because Philippa Foot argues that virtues are necessary for creatures like us. She makes the analogy that, “virtues play a necessary part in the life of human beings as do stings in the life of bees”.[@foot2001natural 35] To discuss her account of virtue it will be useful to discuss the concept of what is “necessary for humans” in writings like those of Peter Geach, whose analogy she is paraphrasing. Similarly, the concept of *human nature* is key for Foot (as for Rosalind Hursthouse), as is *second nature* for McDowell. 

These are age-old themes. Treating them adequately is the task of a lifetime, not a single dissertation. "The measure of listening to such discussions is the whole of life."[@plato Republic 450b.] Yet they are worthy themes. Even an inadequate treatment of a worthy theme may hope to attain some value. To render these themes more manageable, I limit my scope to the ethical writings of four contemporary "neo-Aristotelian" virtue theorists. I remain sensitive to his or her project and major claims, to the constructive arguments supporting those claims, and to the various local skirmishes that arise from particular critics. Even so, common themes emerge and this author's (perhaps idiosyncratic) commitments become clear as the dust settles. </Text>

            <Text>##Nature and God
Two broader metaphysical considerations merit a returning comment. The first is about the concept of nature. If nature is just that which is, then it is a truism and a tautology to say that naturalism is a true doctrine, where ‘naturalism’ is the thesis that only nature exists. Saying “only nature exists” just means, on this account, “only things with natures exist” or better yet, “only that which exists exists.” I dare say only a madman would earnestly disagree. 

So on the one hand the doctrine that only nature exists is true but trivially true. On the other hand, the doctrine is question-begging and (in my view) false. If “nature” is just physical stuff, then at least the statement “only nature exists” is synthetic and not tautologous. On this account, of course, naturalism cannot but be physicalist. There is no “relaxed naturalism” on this view. And it won’t do to assume physicalism without argument, especially in the face pressing reasons (from the ethical considerations about virtue inter alia) to believe some values and virtues and even our own human nature is not physical in this sense. But the present case is much worse than just begging the question. The attempt to clarify that takes “nature” to mean “physical stuff” will not do. Because the Greek word physis (φύσις) from which we derive “physical” — exactly like the Latin word natura from which we derive “nature — just means the inner core or essence or real substance of a given entity. To speak of God’s physical properties is quite literally to speak of what properties he has by nature, as opposed to by choice or convention or some other way. To say that the soul is physical is to say that the soul has it’s own nature, essence, form, underlying substance, hypostasis, or reality. At least, that is what those words might mean. So to assume that the very word ‘physicalism’ gets us to what we might want — a denial of spooky stuff — is already moving too fast, let alone assuming that the doctrine we are (futilely) expressing is true. 

What does the naturalist want to affirm or deny by claiming ‘nature’ as his own special metaphysical or epistemological ally? Perhaps she can take recourse to ostensive definitions. Ostensive definitions (like Frank Jackson’s) point to familiar exemplars of natural objects, tables, mountains, badgers, stars, etc. and define ‘natural properties’ as those ‘needed to give a complete account of things like them” (183, quoting Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics, p.7). First, a non-naturalist can “insist that moral properties” need be included in a complete account. Secondly, we cannot just assume that tables, mountains, badgers, stars are merely physical in that what appears to be is fully what is. It turns out that the table appears solid but is composed of an interlocking sub-atomic lattice shot through with empty space (or so we now surmise). Since ‘atom’ in Greek signifies ‘uncuttable’, the “atoms” of the early 19th century are not actually atomic; what seems to be uncuttable, the smallest elemental bit of matter, turns out to be composed of hadrons (either baryons or mesons), which hadrons are composed of quarks, which are composed of... etc. As scandalous as it may sound, not even physical things are necessarily just physical. </Text>

## Thesis  ##

This dissertation defends four claims: It argues that (a) commonly accepted virtues of the mind and will (such as courage, justice, moderation, and practical wisdom, wisdom) are perfections of human nature in practice, that (b) such virtues are necessary for human beings as such — i.e. the task of becoming  virtuous is *a categorical imperative,* a perfect duty, an unconditional obligation that also has the best consequences, makes the most people most happy; that (c) though not all people accurately described as ‘virtuous’ are accurately described as ‘happy’, only virtuous people are happy, and finally (d) a second-order claim about claims (a)-(c) that they are compatible with metaphysical naturalism correctly understood.  

These are age-old themes. Treating them adequately is the task of a lifetime, not a single dissertation. "The measure of listening to such discussions is the whole of life."[@plato Republic 450b.] Yet they are worthy themes. Even an inadequate treatment of a worthy theme may hope to attain some value. 

To render these themes more manageable, I limit my scope to the ethical writings of five contemporary "neo-Aristotelian" virtue theorists: Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Robert M. Adams. Each chapter offers a treatment, however incomplete, of one of these thinkers. Each chapter elucidates key insights and defends what I take to be true in these insights.

The first three claims are liable to be seen by some as platitudes. The fourth is perhaps still lively and controversial. Regardless, there are objections to all these claims. Just as importantly, there are objections to *the assumptions undergirding* such claims. The articulation and defense of these claims proceeds in a pattern not strictly linear. Each chapter is sensitive and responsive to a given thinker -- to his or her project and major claims, to the constructive arguments supporting those claims, and to the various local skirmishes that arise from particular critics. Even so, common themes emerge and this author's (perhaps idiosyncratic) commitments become clear as the dust settles. 

My goal is not in the end to uncover any fresh moral truths nor even to freshly demonstrate age-old platitudes. My strategy is essential conservative: to dismantle common prejudicial objections to the assumptions undergirding (a)-(c) and rendering it plausible to believe (a)-(c) if each objection can be either undercut or rebutted. 

The defense of these claims, therefore, takes the form of an exploration of virtue, practical reason, and happiness.  Though of course details are needed, I think it best to offer a very rough initial account of three key terms: *Virtues* are positive character qualities that are admirable, necessary for living well; *practical reason* is that rational faculty of reflective and intentional deliberation by which we construct and execute life plans; and *happiness* is quite simply a name for a person (or group) whose life is going well, who has good character and has a good life plan and is executing it more or less according to plan. 

The concepts of virtue, practical reason, and happiness are the primary focus of this research. But my focus will extend to include other key concepts that these philosophers invoke in their account of virtue. For instance, *practice* is a key secondary concept in MacIntyre because he defines virtues as “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to *practices*.”[@macintyre1984after, 191, emphasis added. *After Virtue* was published in 1981. Unless otherwise noted, the citations in this proposal refer to the 1984 second edition.]  To discuss MacIntyre's account of virtue it will be useful to discuss writings like that of Michael Thompson, who gives an account of life, action, and practice.[@thompson2008life] Another key secondary concept is that of a *human life-form*, because Philippa Foot argues that virtues are necessary for creatures like us. She says, “virtues play a necessary part in the life of human beings as do stings in the life of bees.”[@foot2001natural 35] To discuss her account of virtue it will be useful to discuss concept of what is “necessary for humans” in the writings like that of Peter Geach. Similarly, the concept of *human nature* is key for Hursthouse, as is *second nature* for McDowell. 

For each writer, I shall remaining sensitive to their particular project, while keeping an eye on some or all of these thematic questions.  My primary governing questions are: how does each philosopher conceive of virtue? How does he or she defend that conception against the battery of objections from critics? And what can we cull from their accounts that is of value? </Text>

            <Text>“Foot has also been criticised on other grounds by Phillips and Mounce, who say that her talk of internal relations already involves evaluation and not just description. For the fact or thing that is the object of the internal relation is not just a fact, but a fact assessed with respect to a norm. Pushing, for instance, is only ‘rude’ or ‘offensive’ if it is so assessed, not if “pure facts” alone are mentioned (as, say, in a physiological account of pushing). This is proved by the con- sideration that if it were just a matter of facts agreement would eventually be reached, for the facts are “incontrovert- ible,” but in matters of morality one soon reaches “deadlock” (in Hudson, 1969: 232-239). 
This argument will not work. Facts are not incontro- vertible in the sense that no one will controvert them; for not only are there commitments that some people will deny anything to maintain, there is also sheer perversity. In moral- ity perversity is more of a problem because it touches human desires and interests so closely, while science does not. Ter- rorists, for instance, who want to go on committing murder, will not be concerned to deny the impossibility of squaring the circle, but they will be concerned to deny that there is any- thing really bad about murder, or that what they are doing is really murder, no matter what one says to show the opposite. One must distinguish between ‘incontrovertible’ where it refers to what one can do, and where it refers to what the facts will allow. The facts of plane triangles do not allow them to have angles equal to more or less than 180¡, but that does not mean one cannot deny this if one so wishes. There is nothing, even in science, that is incontrovertible in this sense, but of course that does not mean there is nothing incontrovertible in it in the other sense. With respect to the phenomenon of dis- agreement, therefore, one has no reason to suppose that mor- ality is any different from science. It does, indeed, suffer more from perverse controversion than science does, but that is not surprising given how it may, and often does, cross our desires. The fact, however, that it is often controverted in this sense cannot show that it is controvertible in the other sense. One cannot, therefore, determine whether morality has to do with facts or not by adverting to “deadlocks” in moral disagree- ments.” (87-8)




When one turns from non-human to human contexts one again finds senses of good that a volitional analysis has to exclude. There is sometimes a difference between what we choose or desire and what is really good for us. For instance, we may take a medicine to cure a disease and in fact only make the disease worse. One would say here that a wrong 
Good and Being 
136 
choice had been made, and that what was chosen was bad, even though it was chosen as good. And the implication of this is that its badness was independent of our choice. The medicine was not good because we expressed ourselves in favour of it, nor has it become bad now because we have changed our minds and expressed ourselves against it; rather it was always bad for us quite independently of what we said or thought. The same goes for the medicine that should have been chosen instead, for this too was good all the time regardless of the choices made. In other words, the badness of the one and the goodness of the other were something independent, or inherent in the things themselves, and not relative to any human acts or speech. But this is just what a volitional analysis has to deny, for it does, of necessity, make good and bad relative to what people wish and say. So here also there is a sense of good, quite commonly found in the ordinary course of things, that such an analysis has to reject. 
Another non-volitional sense of good is found in the thought of Stevenson and Hare themselves. Both admitted a good that is, in some way, good as a matter of fact. For Stevenson this factual good is science, while for Hare it is something like the exercise of freedom. These goods, about which they said nothing expressly but which lay beneath the surface of their thought, are not only, even for them, factual or cognitive, but, what is more, serve as the justification or ground of the non-factual, volitional good about which they did expressly speak. 
There is also this further point. To say something is good gives, in human contexts, a reason for doing it. But giv- ing a reason is not like issuing an imperative or expressing a favourable attitude. All these may, it is true, have in common that they direct to action, but they do not do so in the same way. An imperative does so directly, and no reason is needed for it, especially when it comes from someone in authority, as from a general to a private soldier. To express a favourable at- titude may well be to indicate one’s desire or wish that such and such be done, but it does not by itself constitute a reason for doing it; indeed, no volitional act however expressed does this. To give a reason, however, is to direct to action by giving 
Good and Being 
137 
information about what it is really worth choosing and doing. Hence saying something is good is far more like a statement (even in its logical, to say nothing of its grammatical, form) than like an imperative or an exclamation or a wish. 
If a volitional analysis of good is inadequate, a cogni- tive analysis in terms of facts is no less so. Good cannot be taken to signify any one fact or set of facts. The goodness of a good strawberry, for instance, is not the fact that it is red or juicy, nor is the goodness of a good action the fact that it causes pleasure. Mere redness is not by itself good, or at least not always (the redness of sunburn is not), and, of course, it is a commonplace that not all pleasant actions are good. More- over, different things are said to be good for different reasons, and a property that is good here is bad there (as softness is good in a sponge but not in a hammer). 
Nor can one say that good is some peculiar fact of its own, for, as Hare has rightly pointed out, one cannot say of two things that they are exactly alike save that one is good and the other not, whereas one can say of two things that they are exactly alike save that one is yellow and the other not. Never- theless if good is not a fact or a collection of facts, the facts are not irrelevant to it. A strawberry that is not red and juicy will not usually be called a good strawberry, even though its being good is not the same as its being red and juicy; and, further, to call a thing good is generally to call it good in vir- tue of something about it, some property or properties it has − for one calls a red, juicy strawberry good because it is red and juicy, and one calls a smooth, soft sponge good because it is smooth and soft. Good is, to revert to Hare’s term, super- venient: it both says more than the facts or properties of a thing, and yet it is somehow attached to, and dependent on, those facts as well. It is, indeed, just this supervenience of good that, above all, rules out a factual analysis of good. 
The conclusion one must draw from this is that, while one cannot give a volitional account of good, one cannot give a cognitive account either unless one increases the scope of the cognitive beyond that of the factual. Indeed the necessity so to increase it, if one is to give a cognitive account, may be said to be the principal message of the last chapter. For it was 
Good and Being 
138 
the severe reduction of knowledge, the prevalence of empiri- cist epistemological despair, that led originally to the separa- tion of good from cognition. The overcoming of this reduction is precisely what the appeal to being is meant to achieve.”


“Moore, it is true, objects to this likening of the desirable to the visible. He argues that whereas ‘visible’ means ‘able to be seen’, ‘desirable’ does not mean ‘able to be desired’ but rather something like ‘ought to be desired’ or ‘deserving to be desired’ (1903: 67). “


It is not enough, however, to leave the notion of good at this level of signifying being in its relation to desire. This, by it- self, might imply that, even if things are good independently of whether they are desired, there was a necessary reference in the idea of good just to that realm of being where desire is or could be found, and this might be thought to imply a reference to the human world. 
But besides this question there are also others that arise and need to be clarified. There is, for instance, the question of the drawing power of good, or how it moves to action. While this is, in an important sense, sufficiently answered by saying good is the object of desire (for it is desire that moves to action, and so what moves desire must move to action also), there is still a need for a more particular explanation of it in human contexts. But as this is more properly dealt with in the discussion of thinking and willing it will be left to chapter 8. There is also the question of bad and evil, and of how there can be bad and evil in things if good goes along with being and if thus every being is good; and there is also the question of how there can be a good by nature, or how it is that, if everything is good, there can be a particular natural good for each thing. This second question will be taken up expressly in 
Good and Being 
155 
the next chapter, but certain remarks in what follows will also be relevant to it. The question of bad and evil will be taken up expressly in this chapter. 
To come then to the question of the scope or extension of desire. The object of desire is the end or goal which desire seeks in seeking its object, and which it naturally pursues. Desire is in general a directedness towards an object, a tend- ing or even moving towards it. One does, after all, speak of the goals of movement, meaning that what the movement is a movement towards is its goal. When one talks of desire, how- ever, one generally has some consciousness or at least sen- sation in mind. One describes the tending towards objects of sensing and thinking things as their desires. But the same structure, I mean the structure of tending or moving towards objects, exists also in things that lack sensation and thought. Flowers, for instance, tend toward the sunlight (one even says they seek the sunlight), and the ordinary processes of growth that one finds in things are just the movements of these beings towards their full maturity. It is by noting these facts, namely the structure of desire and the structure of tending towards in the being of even non-conscious things, that one may admit the legitimacy of the concept of natural desire, that is of desire that exists in things as a matter of their nature, and not of any- thing conscious. And of course, the objects of these natural desires, these natural tendings towards, will be properly des- cribed as goods − the goods of the things in question. 
One may also look at the matter from the point of view of the ideas of the potential and the actual, and of the realisa- tion of the potential by the actual. A thing is said to be poten- tial with respect to what it can be but not yet is, and it is said to be actual with respect to what it now is or has become. But to take a thing in terms of its potentialities is to take it in its relation and directedness to the respective actualities. ‘Poten- tial’ simply indicates a thing under the aspect of what it can be, or of how it is disposed to being; and this just means that, qua potential, it tends towards or is directed to that particular actuality. Since this is the same structure as desire, one may say that the relation of the potential to its respective actuality is the same as the relation of desire. And given that the natural 
Good and Being 
156 
world in general is a world of things that are in a state of change and becoming (things come to be and cease to be, are born, grow, decay and die), which is the state of becoming actual, or ceasing to be actual, with respect to the poten- tialities to be that each thing has, one may say that the idea of desire, in its broadest sense where it does not include also the idea of consciousness, is found throughout the natural world. Thus the idea of good, as the idea of being in the sense in which it is an object of desire, is an idea that has reference outside human contexts altogether. 
This way of understanding things has become opaque because of the dominance of empiricist thinking. In Hume, for instance, it is impossible to speak intelligibly of motion or change, and hence of the actualisation of potentialities; for change requires the permanence of the subject that undergoes change, as water endures throughout when it changes from cold to hot. For Hume, however, there is no such subject, but only a succession of ideas, each of which is complete in itself and distinct from all others. Change is, therefore, reduced to something else, namely a succession of sense data or a series of instantaneous creations and annihilations. There is no dyn- amism in any of these data; they do not develop or grow or move; they are static; they are entirely complete and fixed as what they are. The most that happens is that at one moment they are, and at the next they are not (that this follows from Hume’s position is evident from his discussion of space and time). To the extent that all empiricists speak of data in the same way and make them first and basic, all of them lack the sense of motion and change. To the extent, moreover, that the methodology of modern physical science is empiricist, or to the extent that, as Kant indicated, it just subsumes such empi- ricist data under models and theories and traces the propor- tions and relations of their mathematical properties, it too lacks a sense of motion, and hence has no place for the doc- trine of the actual and potential. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, within the perspective of modern science to speak of the natural appetites of things. (More will be said on this issue of change and of how things have potentials to be, the realisation of which is their good, in the next chapter.)

            <Title>What are we trying to explain?</Title>
            <Text>##What are we trying to explain? 

The explananda that our metaethical theorizing aims to explain is not easy to define. Here are some things I don’t think we are trying to explain: we are not trying to give moral guidance to the morally confused. Most people have firm moral convictions on a wide range of issues. Theists have ready-made moralities on a wide range of issues given to them, they take it, by god. Atheists as it happens often have a wide range of moral beliefs based on the responsibility we have as humans if we are alone in the universe and solely responsible for our destinies, our disasters, and our hopes. In *An Atheist’s Guide to Reality* by Alex Rosenburg, as a popular middlebrow example, he lays out how atheists ought to approach personal, interpersonal, and political challenges that life puts before each of us. By contrast, Peter Kreeft’s  Making Choices is a theistic version of much the same guide. There are certainly moral disagreements at a cultural level, [which we have already had occasion to mention: abortion, sexual ethics, family ethics, international law, legal policy, foreign policy, poverty and wealth, religious freedom, freedom of speech, etc.] and within sub-cultures and even within each of us. But disagreement is most often between parties dedicated to a firm moral conviction. We are therefore not doing metaethics to give the morally confused a bit of advice. We are usually doing metaethics to examine why we have the moral beliefs

What we are puzzling over is normativity. In light of naturalism broadly construed — in light of modern empirical science and reductive philosophy — we are puzzling over the contrast between norms and everything else non-normative. Everything that is puzzling, from naturalistic assumptions, about moral norms is equally or almost equally puzzling about epistemic norms, as Professor Cuneo has labored to show. For this reason, it would be wrong-headed and myopic to speak only of moral norms. 

We are not just examining a few words, like ‘goodness’ or ‘right.’ To read some metaethicist literature, one would think that the only puzzle about ethics is the perpetual recurrence in all evaluative and normative discourse of the English word ‘good.’ We are not just puzzling over language merely but intentionality in thought, speech, discourse, and in deliberation. That is, normativity as it shows up in everyday utterances like “that was a good movie, thanks for the recommendation” or she is a good teacher; you should take her class” but also much more: Normativity shows up in my private thoughts (“how can I lose weight? what is wrong with my health?”) in communication (“what do you think of your Sienna? Is it better or worse than your old Odyssey?”) and in deliberation (“what is to be done with Iran? Is Guantanomo Bay to be shut down?”). We are trying to explain the pervasiveness of normativity. 

First I have to show you why it needs explaining. Then I have to show you why a paradigmatic moral realism enriched by virtue theory is such a satisfying explanans. Finally, I have to show you why other some other theories are not so satisfying on some or all explananda. Some of these theories at which I will level critique are virtue theories, but others are not. The ones that do not rely on (or even mention) virtue I show to be significantly conceptually impoverished by contrast to virtue theoretical approaches. The the ones that do rely on virtue attempt to remain in the fold of naturalism broadly construed. So I have to show that such an attempt is misguided. My argument that trying to make virtue theories naturalistic is misguided has two parts: the first that “naturalism broadly construed” gives up on the core naturalist tenets that motivate naturalists to avoid non-naturalism in the first place. Such a broad construal is naturalistic in name only. The second part that naturalism excludes the notions of virtue altogether.

            <Text>## Why virtue ethics? ##

My approach to philosophical ethics is to study virtue ethicists and to explore virtue and related concepts like practical reason and happiness. 

A reasonable preliminary question I should address is this: Why write about virtue? Why study virtue ethicists? I have two answers: one sociological, the other personal. 

The sociological answer first: In the last 60 years or so, “virtue ethics” broadly construed has garnered the support of a remarkably high percentage of analytic philosophers.[@chalmers2014philosophers. This survey shows that roughly the same amount of analytic philosophers adhere to "virtue ethics" as adhere to deontology (about 1/5th).] 

There are various interpretations of this revival. One is that many philosophers have become profoundly dissatisfied with modern moral philosophy. (Alasdair MacIntyre represents this view.) On this reading, Aristotle and Confucius provide refreshing alternatives to the stolid, dry, rationalism of Kant or Mill.

But one of our most prestigious living virtue ethicists, Rosalind Hursthouse, disputes this interpretation. Virtue ethics presented itself as a rival during the early fledgling efforts to win a place at the table of modern moral philosophy; now that it *has* a place, such a presentation is needlessly combative. Her alternative interpretation is lent support by the acquisition (or re-acquisition) of virtue talk in other modern moral philosophies. Julia Driver, Ben Bradley and others have been working to articulate a theory they call “virtue consequentialism” or “character consequentialism”. In contrast to “act” or “rule” utilitarianisms, virtue consequentialism describes virtues as those traits whose possessors tend to bring about the most desirable consequences. 

A second interpretation of the surprising renaissance of virtue ethics is that virtue concepts are potent and flexible. That is, virtue concepts can be systematized into coherent, stable, theories of their own. But they can also can enrich deontological and utilitarian and contractarian theories.  In fact, they can even help non-philosophers (such as college undergraduate) to avoid damaging vices and live well. The question "How do I live well? What is a beautiful life for me?" is, arguably, not an optional one but an inescapable question that arises for every person that survives to adulthood. 

My own view is that both of these interpretations of the revival of contemporary virtue ethics capture an important truth. On the one hand, those who study virtue ethics can indeed achieve an excellent position from which to critique modern moral philosophy. Long familiarity with cultures, places, and times different from one's own has the salubrious effect of opening one's eyes to one's own culture and time. The philosopher conversant with Aristotle or Aquinas likely to notice and articulate modern assumptions or biases that are invisible to those of us who live in modernity. 

At the same time, it is not a foregone conclusion that contemporary virtue ethicist will *reject* widespread modern assumptions. Some, such as Murdoch and MacIntyre, did become staunch opponents of modernity. Some, such as McDowell and Hursthouse, become staunch defenders, even while working to enrich modernity with pre-modern tradition. 

Throughout these investigations, I consider both possibilities. By taking a broader historical perspective, some virtue ethicists find in ancient and medieval philosophers a refreshing relief from the hidebound modern assumptions; others find in them an invigorating resource for advancing progress upon modern assumptions.

The personal answer: Although I was raised in a household of strict morals, it was not until I was introduced (in undergraduate days) to the concept of virtue as a live and practical moral concept. What struck me then, as now, was the connection between virtue and *eudaimonia*, between goodness and happiness, between the individual's good and the public good, between the flourishing of one person and the thriving of the community. Human beings are not (like ants) parts of a collective, beholden to the hive for food and safety; nor are human beings (like Homer's Cyclops) *radically individual* loners, isolated from all neighbors. Rather, in the famous words of St. Paul, "we, being many, are one body... and every one members one of another" (Rom 12.5). The crucial metaphor that illuminates morality is not the legal but the organic. Virtue concepts are organic. They are often praised (and *criticized*) for being "uncodifiable”.[See @mcdowell1979virtue for a discussion of the “uncodifiability” nature of deductive *and* practical reason, which discussion owes much to Wittgenstein.] Virtue concepts are practical, flexible, sometimes fuzzy -- just like every other useful concept. Since being introduced to the older tradition of living virtuously in order to thrive and be happy, and since introducing others likewise, these concepts and the tradition they enrich has come to seem as natural as breathing and as necessary.</Text>

1. Moral Discourse as a species of Normative Discourse
If metaethics is the discipline in which we explain moral talk, then metaethical theories are, first and foremost, explanations of data. Of course, competing and incompatible explanations can be equally plausible with respect to how well the account for the data. But we aim for the best explanation, all things considered.
If this is right, secondly, the data is “our moral talk.” Now, our moral talk is not a simple, singular phenomenon. By analogy, “football talk” is a phenomenon that encompasses talk about American football and European football, about teams (like the Rams), games (“last night’s game” and “Superbowl III”), plays, players, and so on. Football talk is also connected, in practice, with talk about advertisements shown on television, the food sold at football stadiums, and so on.
Least controversially, moral talk includes judgments about whether actions are right or wrong. In moral talk, we evaluate people’s actions. We judge ourselves and other living persons as well as hypothetical entities (Spiderman, Sherlock Holmes) or abstract non-human persons (Shiva, St. Michael) or historical persons (Caeser, George Washington). We evaluate people for their moral and intellectual qualities. But there is more to our “moral talk.” Using the same family of words, we praise and blame people for their mental lives. Also, using oftentimes the same family of words, we also evaluate living things, systems, and non-living things. I call such a broad range of evaluative talk “normative discourse” and the attempt to explain normative discourse metanormativity. It seems to me that, despite differentia between evaluations of moral, epistemic, and other kinds of values, the structure of normative discourse bears fundamental commonalities. Morality, epistemology, law, aesthetics, and many others refer to normative facts. Normative facts are the way things ought to be, ways things would be good (Moore 1901 %). 
For one thing, we make all sorts of moral evaluations using all sorts of terms: good, beautiful, true, faithful, loving, kind (positive); and bad, ugly, false, cheating, apathetic, and cruel (negative). 
But also, we evaluate people along broader lines than obviously moral talk. “She is smart” is clearly a piece of praise but is not so clearly moral praise. “She is smart because she studies harder and cares more than everyone else” might be a piece of moral praise in that it highlights the virtues of diligence and zeal by which she has attained knowledge, or quickness, or intellectual skill. But absent such details, evaluative terms that praise or blame a person’s intellectual 
Even more broadly, we evaluate things that are not people and are not, strictly speaking, responsible for the way they are. 
We also evaluate using less obviously evaluative terms: “the library is quite orderly”; “his campaign was a surprise”. Is the word “orderly” a value term? It seems so to me. What about “surprise”? In context, English speakers don’t commonly use ‘surprise’ to indicate something unexpected and negative, but something unexpected and positive (“a surprise birthday party”). We perhaps deploy “shock” to indicated a negative unexpected event (we can only imagine what would warrant the description, “a shocking birthday party”).  
Metaethical theory must explain the objective purport of our evaluative talk (Gibbard; Finlay). I here assume normative realism of the sort Peter Schaber defends (Schaber). So my focus shall be the debate between naturalist and non-naturalist realists.

My wife Lindsay read almost every page of this dissertation before it went to print. Her background in philosophy, her zeal for excellence, and (what's more) her natural intellect allowed her to catch more errors and suggest more improvements to the argument and structure than any other single editor. Furthermore, she often made such corrections and suggestions with a babbling baby on her lap or (if the babies were asleep) made them when other sensible folks were asleep. While she may write her own dissertation one day soon, I can without exaggeration say that this is dissertation of mine in many ways belongs to her. In a real sense, I *owe* it to her, who followed me to Kentucky and in every way created our life together while I completed this labor. In gratitude, I offer it back to you.

## Acknowledgments (Optional)

My thanks are owed to many people. Dr. David Bradshaw has been not only a professor but mentor from beginning to end. Dr. Gary Hartenburg was a helping hand to get me to graduate school. Dr. John Mark Reynolds first encouraged me to graduate school while teaching. 

My late father, Rich Buhler, unbeknownst to me, predicted that I would earn a PhD. He had two honorary doctorates but always underscored to me that an earned doctorate was different. I hope I have made him proud. 

My sister Kristi always believed in me and told me that one day I would be working as a professor. The first person who ordered me to go to graduate school was John Mark Reynolds. John Mark, I have finally fulfilled the plan we dreamed up. J. P. Moreland taught my first graduate school class in philosophy and used tough love and tough arguments to show me how hard and how rewarding this kind of research can be. 

David Bradshaw’s tireless, patient, gentle, and exacting academic leadership has shown me not only excellent scholarship but an excellent life. My first and final dialectical partner is Lindsay, whose conversations have been the school in which I have learned and still learn to love beauty and truth.

            <Text>
Moral realism is a defeasible presumption. That means it's true that there are moral facts until we can prove that it's false with a really sound objection. Naturalism claims to provide such a really sound objection.

 The objection is that values are just too different from facts. I call this the "disharmony" objection or the "radical discontinuity" objection. The feeling is that, at bottom, all of reality must have a commonality and unity to it. All the various *realities* must connect up somehow. This feeling is, I believe, behind Darwin's search for a common ancestor for all the multitudinous life forms we see on the earth (not to mention in the fossil record). Why else would anyone, aware that there are billions of beatles, birds, whales, marmots, guanamos, gnats, elephants, and dogs even *think* of searching for one organism that -- however long ago -- is their universal parent?  
 
 Thomas Nagel has said that the apparent discontinuity between "objective" and "subjective" -- and exploring the two-- defines almost all his works.[^16] Stephen Brown says that a "fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature" (Brown 2008, 4). 
 [^16]: Nagel thinks that the two perspectives are irreconciable. Our best bet is detached, disinterested awareness of both perspectives. When affirming one seems to make impossible affirming the other? Affirm the paradox. 
 
 On this objection, if values are different from facts, if moral facts are so different from nonmoral facts, then something must be wrong. 
 
Their are a variety of available responses to the dissonance objection. One is to give up naturalism: 

* Moral facts are nonnatural but they're real, so get used to it. Reality just turns out to have two fundamentally different and in a sense irreconciable kinds of facts. This is G.E. Moore's and Shaffer-Landeau's choice.  
*  Another is to give up moral realism. Nature is real; values are not natural (or they're just too different from the natural) so these putative values or moral facts have got to go. This is Mackie, Ayer, and Gibbard, Blackburn et. al., 
*  A third way is a spectrum of negotiations and compromises with naturalism that each attempt to keep as much moral realism as possible while doing as much justice as possible to our respect for science. This third way is what I am interested in. It's not that I do not see how one could give up moral realism, I just cannot do it. I find it psychologically impossible to live as if it *might* be OK for me to, rather than feed and clothe and educate my kids, to put them in a freezer. [^15]

 [^15]: ![Woman puts kids in freezer](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/detroit-bodies-found-freezer/70419644/)


For instance, we could say that only nature is real and only what is natural can be known but argue that values and moral facts and so on are natural. But what do we mean by natural? 

* Could mean that values are endemic to human nature, to humans, and that humans are natural. Examples: John McDowell, Philippa Foot.  
* We could mean that values are features of the natural world just like natural kinds. Example: Richard Boyd. 
* Values could be natural the way that health is natural and anything that produces health. Example: Paul Bloomfield.
* Still others might argue that values are natural that supervene on normal natural facts the same way psychological fax super being on normal physical facts. Example: Frank Jackson.

But the fundamental tension between "inside" and "outside" might itself be a misunderstanding. That seems to be one of John McDowell's main points. 

What if the objection from discontinuity or dissonance is misguided? It seems that "science" supports reductive materialist metaphysics but what if our "respect for natural science" demands nothing of the sort? Then the objection against realism weakens. And its inherent plausibility and truly amazing explanatory power shines forth again unabated. 

###Demystifying values as "just part of human nature"
Some try to naturalize values by just putting them all  (or discovering them all) within humans. I don't think this strategy works. It doesn't demystify values, it re-locates the msytery. If all these mysterious non-factual value thingies floating around with no apparent connection or meaning in the natural world are all somehoe internal to human nature, and humans are natural, then all those values are natural, right? Yes, or human nature has just become non-natural. We used to have a "fact/value" split but now we have a "fact/human" split. 

To see how human rising values doesn't demystify values that actually makes humans mysterious, consider the cycle of euphemism. A phenomenon like human fecal matter is impolite to talk about. So we invent a euphemism like "feces." The euphemism works for referring to the same stuff without impoliteness for awhile. Then some kids get ahold of the term, realize what it means, and (having no taste) find it uproariously funny. They make enough jokes to *impolitisize* the polite term, shucking its dignified veneer. We invent another euphemism like "scat". To my knowledge, no one has yet turned "scat" into an exclamation expressing surprise or disapproval.  

To his credit, McDowell sees the parity of epistemic and moral norms. He wants to subjectivize moral norms, so he accordingly subjectivizes epistemic norms. Virtue and reason are *both* transcendental idealized processes, intersubjective human processes, objective enough for our purposes and to explain the objective purport in our thinking, feeling, and acting, but subjective enough to respect the distinction between human nature ("second nature") and *nature* nature (primary nature). 

Even so, second nature remains radically discontinuous from primary nature. Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. </Text>

            <Title>### Why virtue ethics</Title>
            <Text>## Why virtue ethics? ##

My approach to philosophical ethics is to study virtue ethicists and to explore virtue and related concepts like practical reason and happiness. 

A reasonable question to respond to right away is this: Why write about virtue? Why study virtue ethicists? I have two answers: one sociological and general, the other psychological and personal. 

The sociological answer first: In the last 60 years or so, “virtue ethics” broadly construed has garnered the support of a remarkably high percentage of analytic philosophers.[@chalmers2014philosophers. This survey shows that roughly the same amount of analytic philosophers adhere to "virtue ethics" as adhere to deontology (about 1/5th).] 

There are various interpretations of this revival. One is that many philosophers have become profoundly dissatisfied with modern moral philosophy. (Alasdair MacIntyre represents this view.) On this reading, Aristotle and Confucius provide refreshing alternatives to the stolid, dry, rationalism of Kant or Mill.

But one of our most prestigious living virtue ethicists, Rosalind Hursthouse, disputes this interpretation. Virtue ethics presented itself as a rival during the early fledgling efforts to win a place at the table of modern moral philosophy; now that it *has* a place, such a presentation is needlessly combative. Her alternative interpretation is lent support by the acquisition (or re-acquisition) of virtue talk in other modern moral philosophies. Julia Driver, Ben Bradley and others have been working to articulate a theory they call “virtue consequentialism” or “character consequentialism”. In contrast to “act” or “rule” utilitarianisms, virtue consequentialism describes virtues as those traits whose possessors tend to bring about the most desirable consequences. 

A second interpretation of the surprising renaissance of virtue ethics is that virtue concepts are potent and flexible. That is, virtue concepts can be systematized into coherent, stable, theories of their own. But they can also can enrich deontological and utilitarian and contractarian theories.  In fact, they can even help non-philosophers (such as college undergraduate) to avoid damaging vices and live well. The question "How do I live well? What is a beautiful life for me?" is, arguably, not an optional one but an inescapable question that arises for every person that survives to adulthood. 

My own view is that both of these interpretations of the revival of contemporary virtue ethics capture an important truth. On the one hand, those who study virtue ethics can indeed achieve an excellent position from which to critique modern moral philosophy. Long familiarity with cultures, places, and times different from one's own has the salubrious effect of opening one's eyes to one's own culture and time. The philosopher conversant with Aristotle or Aquinas likely to notice and articulate modern assumptions or biases that are invisible to those of us who live in modernity. 

At the same time, it is not a foregone conclusion that contemporary virtue ethicist will *reject* widespread modern assumptions. Some, such as Murdoch and MacIntyre, did become staunch opponents of modernity. Some, such as McDowell and Hursthouse, become staunch defenders, even while working to enrich modernity with pre-modern tradition. 

Throughout these investigations, I consider both possibilities. By taking a broader historical perspective, some virtue ethicists find in ancient and medieval philosophers a refreshing relief from the hidebound modern assumptions; others find in them an invigorating resource for advancing progress upon modern assumptions.

The personal answer: Although I was raised in a household of strict morals, it was not until I was introduced (in undergraduate days) to the concept of virtue as a live and practical moral concept. What struck me then, as now, was the connection between virtue and *eudaimonia*, between goodness and happiness, between the individual's good and the public good, between the flourishing of one person and the thriving of the community. Human beings are not (like ants) parts of a collective, beholden to the hive for food and safety; nor are human beings (like Homer's Cyclops) *radically individual* loners, isolated from all neighbors. Rather, in the famous words of St. Paul, "we, being many, are one body... and every one members one of another" (Rom 12.5). The crucial metaphor that illuminates morality is not the legal but the organic. Virtue concepts are organic. They are often praised (and *criticized*) for being "uncodifiable”.[See @mcdowell1979virtue for a discussion of the “uncodifiability” nature of deductive *and* practical reason, which discussion owes much to Wittgenstein.] Virtue concepts are practical, flexible, sometimes fuzzy -- just like every useful concept. Since being introduced to the older tradition of living virtuously in order to thrive and be happy, and since introducing others likewise, these concepts and the tradition they enrich has come to seem as natural as breathing and as necessary. 

## Some themes ##

In consequence of the revival of virtue ethics, there are many lively and interesting controversies on the main stage as well as some fascinating sideshows. Though consensus around the answers is still forthcoming, a set of thematic questions emerge: 

1. First and foremost, what exactly *is* virtue (and its opposite, vice)? There are many accounts of virtue. Are they compatible or are there some  that are more plausible? 
2. Since Aristotle's writings, virtues have often been thought to play a special role in making the virtuous agent *happy* (eudaemonia, flourishing, thriving, well off, etc.).[Cf. @annas2011intelligent] But Bentham and Nietzsche mock this alleged role. Is there any inherent relation between virtue and happiness? If so, are virtues necessary for happiness (as Foot thinks) or necessary *and sufficient* for happiness (as McDowell thinks)? 
3. Several conceptions of virtue (following Aristotle) have set eudaimonia as the “function” of humanity, its purpose or telos. Does it make sense to speak of a *human function*? If so, just what is it? And how does it relate to our unique attributes, like higher rationality, self-awareness, and language?  @brown2008 accepts natural final causality but rejects eudaimonia, preferring to speak in Darwinian terms about our purpose as reproduction, while @hursthouse1999 speaks about four "characteristically human ends" including but not limited to reproduction. 
4. Relatedly, if virtue is sufficient for happiness, does that mean that the life lived in pursuit of virtues and avoidance of vices is a life of shameless egoism?[Cf. @annas2009; @huang2010self] 
5. Another traditional notion defines virtues as those traits by which one becomes *fully human* or actualizes human nature. (Human nature is something like a set of properties or capacities common to all humans -- at least all non-defective humans. Human nature has been thought to include such essential properties as practical rationality, or rationality in general, language, social consciousness, self-consciousness, or genetic and other environmental/cultural properties.) Talk of a fixed "human nature" implies that an agent's humanity is in one sense a *given* to be discovered, while in another sense it is a goal to be achieved. One of the most persistent and widespread objections to this conception of virtue is that it seems to depend on discredited Aristotelian metaphysical picture of human nature.
6. Even if we could expound and defend a realistic concept of human nature, would basing ethical conclusions on metaphysical or psychological premises commit Moore’s so-called "naturalistic fallacy"? How do we proceed from a premise about *the way human nature is* to the specific normative conclusion such as *humans ought to keep their promises*?
2. Furthermore, there are skeptical worries to the effect that there are no habitual characteristics or acquired traits such as virtues and vices are supposed to be.[@harman2009skepticism] Do virtues and vices qua stable character traits even exist? Or if they exist, do they matter enough to make theorizing about virtue even interesting?[@kamtekar2004situationism]
3. There is a growing body of literature on the theme of intellectual (rather than merely moral) virtues.[Cf. @zagzebski1996virtues;  @bloomfield2000virtue] Some think practical wisdom (or phronesis) is one virtue among many, while others think it the master virtue that unifies both practical and intellectual. Are all virtues practical or are some theoretical? 
9. Finally, there are more abstract or foundational questions such as how (if at all) might an ethical theory built on virtue concepts defend the claim of objective moral knowledge? And what does ‘objective’ mean? I have been helped in the clarification of this term by an old but extremely perspicuous article by @sellars1927naturalism, the father of Wilfred Sellars.

The five key virtue ethicists listed above address some or all of these questions. Since our focus must be limited somehow, I try to remain attentive to the primary themes of my project while commenting briefly or at least acknowledging some of the key general questions that interest virtue ethicists.

            <Title>Physicalism</Title>
            <Text>The primary thesis I am defending is that norms are real features of reality on par with and radically continuous with other real things, be they abstract (natural laws) or concrete objects of various kinds (trees, stars, and mollusks). Knowledge of these norms may be difficult or may be easy. Some cases I have offered for consideration are exceedingly easy for normal rational agents. These I have called 'primary norms.' Primary norms include norms like *it is good to be rational* and *love one another* and *life is good*.  

The question of 'naturalism' I have tried to show is hopelessly vague. The question of 'naturalism' is not, however, meaningless. Teasing out the concerns of naturalists and non-naturalists we discover three clear questions: 

1. Is all that is real physical/material? 
2. Is all that is real real? 
3. Is all that is real divine? 

The second question is just the tautology 'what is real is real' phrased as a question. As such, the answer is Yes. 

1. Is all that is real physical/material? 
2. Is all that is real real? 
3. Is all that is real divine? 

My answers to these shall be: 

1. Is all that is real physical/material? No. 
2. Is all that is real real? Yes. 
3. Is all that is real divine? Not necessarily. 


## 1. Is all that is real physical/material? Physicalism? 

But the question of the reality of x has become for us embroiled in the question of the *physicality* of x. 

The question "is x real?" has often become for many analytic philosophers "is x natural?". I concede to the equivalence. The question "is x natural?" has become for many "is x physical/material?" Since physics as a discipline is undergoing such an overhaul, questions about whether x is physical should be deferred to a distant and uncertain future. But we know what matter is by ostensive definition: "the stuff my computer is made of." I shall take matter, not physical stuff, to be the more basic notion, and even the more scientific and respectable notion.  

The equivalence between reality and nature and between nature (phusis) and matter is, for those who are puzzled by such metaethical questions, the source of the puzzlement. 

In regards to the above list of explananda, we listed some diversities that seem different. 

The problem of the one and the many, as it pertains to metaethics, is this: what if anything unifies all the varieties of value we both *recognize* and *live by*?  

This is what I mean by saying that we are looking for *radical continuity*: what root unifies or might unify these diversities? They are unified in our language and in our thought. Are they really unified in themselves?

There seems to be one kind of goodness distributed across many different but ultimately related kinds. The good of intellect and the good of will are unified, for us humans, in goodness. But the good of beauty, excellence, moral virtue, order, and being itself are not obviously or easily reducible to human goods of intellect and will. I argue that they are not easily reducible because they are not in fact reducible at all. 

For the physicalist, there is no option but to so reduce them. What unifies human goods is just that they contribute to human welfare. Human welfare we must read as a particular configuration of matter (perhaps my and everyone else's brain states being thus-and-so). What unifies all non-human goods is humanity: that is, what all putatively "non-human goods" have in common is that evaluations of them appear in human discourse. 

This is all very misguided. But the problem is the means. The end is correct, however misguided the means. The goal of unification is one we deeply desire and preverbially yearn for. We all want a  satisfying account, a way to understand the whole world a global and radical continuity. We all want to understand the world and our place in it, if there is such a place to be understood. 

The way back on track, then, is to suspend belief in physicalism for now, to suspend the way we use the terms 'nature' and 'science,' and stick to a discussion of normativity in light of a broad and plausible metaphysical framework. 

That framework is a faith in the fundamental proposition that reality is intelligible and hence some (though not all) of our theorizing about reality stops no shorter than reality itself. 

I find it telling that some critiques of my thesis have not said "You are wrong" but "there is no possible answer to your questions because reality is unknowable". The person who tells me I am wrong still believes in truth. The person who tells me reality is unknowable has given up on the inquiry. They are not part of my conversation. If they are right, then by their own lights, my theory of reality is just as fantastic as theirs. They ought not go around criticizing other people's fantasies on the basis of their own fantasy. But if, as I think, a bad theory is not fantasy but falsehood, then a good theory is not pleasing fantasy but truth, they ought to correct both themselves and me. 

That is, the moral nihilist predicates her moral theory on metaphysical nihilism or skepticism. I predicate my metaphysical realism on moral realism. Since I know it to be good to help starving children, to train my natural children, to be faithful to my friends, to be gentle and kind to my wife, therefore I know knowledge of reality is possible. There are many moral truths, lamentably many, important ones, that I know I am ignorant of. But not these. These are non-negotiable. Openness with respect to the badness of cruelty is a base, dangerous, and noxious openness. Openness with respect to these true ethical judgments would be just as bad as being closed with respect to negotiable ethical judgments like that felons should not vote or that divorce should be illegal. The question is not "is it good to be open-minded or close-minded?" but "about what should one be close-minded? what open-minded?"

            <Title>Dowell, J.L., What is Ethical naturalism</Title>
            <Text>One core element in Boyd’s theory is an externalist semantics for moral terms, modeled on the Kripke/Putnam account of natural kind terms. (For an independent development of this idea, see Brink 2001.) On Boyd’s (1988) view, moral terms refer to the properties that causally regulate our use of them in such a way that more of our judgments using them become true over time. The increasing conformity in  judgment between people over time indicates that our judgments are approximately correct judgments about those properties.



Thanks for this article, Tim. 
I notice Dowell doesn't mention Hursthouse, McDowell, Foot, et. al. Perhaps rightly so -- they espouse a very different kind of ethical naturalism. Even Hursthouse admits that “proponents of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism… are… unlike other proponents of ethical naturalism and they occupy such an unfamiliar position in philosophy…” [footnote 1: See below for full quote] 
The goal all these proponents pursue, and the one I am pursuing, is that of grounding ethical facts in facts about human nature (Brown 2009, 9). Other naturalists tend to try to ground ethical facts in facts about non-human nature. This is a difference. But is the neo-Aristotelian strategy an advantage or disadvantage? Dowell doesn't seem to consider that question.  
In the discussion of ostensive definitions of the property of being natural, she says this: "In the case of the ostensive definition, it seems open to the non-naturalist to hold that human beings are paradigmatically natural objects and that some of them instantiate the (sui generis, non-natural) properties of goodness and badness (see Copp 2003: 183 for a similar suggestion). In the case of the deferential method, there seems to be no guarantee that paradigmatically non-natural properties will not be among the properties natural scientists will one day in fact posit."
I'm not sure why the parenthetical caveat that if human beings instantiate the property of goodness or badness then they must instantiate non-natural property of goodness and badness. Such a caveat seems to exclude by assumption the possibility that human beings can or do instantiate natural properties (like kin protection) that are also normative or evaluative properties. It excludes the possibility of "natural goodness." And natural goodness is just what Foot and Hursthouse defend: Some facts are natural facts and normative or evaluative facts. 
Now, certainly we neo-Aristotelians are up to something different.  Jackson, Boyd, et al., are trying to ground ethical facts in non-human nature. Admittedly, grounding ethical facts in nature by way ofhuman nature is a different kind of naturalism. But it is still a form of naturalism. We might say it is a rival form of naturalism according to a rival conception of 'naturalism.' Rehg and Davis allege that this project is too "neo-Kantian" to be naturalistic (Rehg and Davis 2003). I intend to address those criticisms eventually.[footnote 2] But merely citing the difference between two conceptions of naturalism doesn't settle which is more adquate. It might be that our neo-Aristotelian naturalism highlights shortcomings in other kinds of naturalism, rather than vice versa. 



It was a good article, and such things are helping me to define and distinguish my project from other projects on offer.

[1] The abstract for a Hursthouse (2013) says:  "The proponents of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism (henceforth “Aristotelian naturalism” for short) include Foot (2001), Geach (1956, 1977), Hursthouse (1999), McDowell (1995), MacIntyre (1999), Nussbaum (1993, 1995), and Thompson (1995); and also Anscombe because her work has influenced so many others. (Gaut [1997, 2002] should also be known as a significant contributor.) Their views are so unlike those of other proponents of ethical naturalism (see Naturalism, Ethical), and they occupy such an unfamiliar position in philosophy, that they are simultaneously criticized on at least two quite different bases. Some say they are not trying to offer naturalism at all, because they avowedly employ a moralized conception of human nature; some say they are trying to offer naturalism insofar as they offer a biological foundation for ethics, but that either this has counterintuitive upshots or the biology is Aristotle's and thereby pre-Darwinian and not a proper naturalistic foundation at all."
 
[2] For instance, one difference between let's call it 'third-person perspective naturalism' and 'first-person perspective naturalism' is that the perspective we take on non-human nature is different from that we take on rocks and plants. We are humans so in our investigations of human nature, we unavoidably and beneficially adopt a given (first-person) perspective, rather than attempting the same neutral third-person perspective we adopt toward (say) geological and biological facts. But the notion that adopting a first-person perspective is necessary for doing ethical research does not defy naturalism. It only defies the notion that a naturalistic theory must restrict itself exclusively to a third-person perspective on human nature. I think we have good reason to think such restrictions mistaken.

            <Text>Some questions for neo-Aristotelian naturalism. (How does each thinker address these?) 

	1)	What is human nature? 
	2)	What is a virtue?
	3)	Why be virtuous? 
	4)	What is rationality?
	5)	Are humans essential rational? 
	6)	Is the domain of morality identical to the domain of practical reason or a special domain within it? 
	7)	How does humanity relate to the rest of nature?
	8)	Are humans divine? Aristotle says yes. 
	9)	Does moral luck determine your virtue? (Harper says this was the view of the ancient world.)
	10)	Do humans evolve? (Philosophy of science, of biology)
	11)	Is ethics a science? By the way, is science just the hard sciences, the natural sciences, or any systematic discipline of knowledge? 
	12)	How is a virtue “mine”?
	13)	What kinds of facts are virtues? Natural facts? Human attributes?
	14)	Do virtues benefit their possessor? 
	15)	What is happiness? Is it different from flourishing?
	16)	What is the role of emotion in virtue? 
	17)	What is Kant’s theory of virtue? 
	18)	What is Mill’s theory of virtue?
	19)	What is Nietzsche’s theory of virtue?
	20)	Is virtue ethics an alternative to theistic (divine law) ethics, or another version of it? (Anscombe)
	21)	Is a secular content-full morality possible in virtue ethics? (Engelhard)

### Theses

1. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of human nature. 
2. Humans are natural -- that is, we are radically continuous with nature.
3. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of nature. 
4. To begin our understanding of ourselves by studying all that is not us (stars, trees, rocks, amoeba, giraffes) is insane; to begin our understanding of all that is not us (physics, chemistry, botany, biology, astronomy) by studying ourselves is perfectly reasonable. 
5. Nature includes *ends* (teloi) as well as value-properties like goodness and beauty. 
6.  Normativity for human nature means: We really ought to think in certain ways and act in certain ways.
7. Number six is not all of nature's normativity. 
8. Excellence and beauty are both goods but different from each other. </Text>

            <Title>## Why these </Title>
            <Text>## Why these four? ##

A second question we should ask and answer up front: Why these four? Certainly, these four authors are an excellent starting point, since they have each in their own way contributed to the revival of virtue ethics. But I would like to more specifically discuss why I select these four writers. 

There are many important and influential philosophers who have written on virtue ethics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: any list of "big names" would have to include Peter Geach,[@geach1977virtues] Elizabeth Anscombe,[@anscombe1958; @anscombe1957intention] Iris Murdoch,[@murdoch2013sovereignty] Martha Nussbaum,[@nussbaum1995;  @nussbaum1988non] Judith Thomson, Julia Annas,[@annas2011intelligent] Michael Thompson, Christine Swanton,[@swanton2003virtue] Michael Slote,[@slote1992morality] Rosalind Hursthouse,[@hursthouse1999] and Paul Bloomfield[@bloomfield2003moral], among others. And certainly, one could construct a worthwhile project approaching some or all of these authors. 

First, I select them partly because I find them the most interesting and sympathetic to my own views. Secondly, I am convinced that focusing on these four authors will provide an interesting and fruitful plan of research for years to come. Most of them are already in extended conversation with each other. For example, there are clear lines of influence from Anscombe to all these writers; from MacIntyre to Hursthouse; from Foot to McDowell, and so on. Yet for all these converging lines, there are many divergent ones. These four represent a fascinating diversity of views. Highlighting overlapping points and contrasting divergent ones promises an opportunity for illuminating connections and deeper insights into the theory of each author. 

Thirdly, each of these philosophers is similarly ambitious in presenting coherent yet wide-ranging theories sensitive both to normative ethical questions about virtue, happiness, goodness, human well-being, etc., and also to the foundations of virtue in moral epistemology, moral metaphysics, moral psychology, etc. MacIntyre, Foot, McDowell, and Adams each present the ethical *and* metaethical aspects of their theories as an organic whole. This ambitious kind of project Stephen Darwall simply calls "philosophical ethics”.[@darwall2003should] I shall say more about how these five conceive the relation between ethics and metaethics in the next chapter. </Text>
