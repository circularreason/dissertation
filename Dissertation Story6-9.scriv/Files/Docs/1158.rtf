\f0\fs24 \cf2 Scientific ethics conjures a range of images , not all of them good. That we should make ethics continuous with science doesn't mean, in advance or automatically, that we should reduce ethics to a mere descriptive, debunked version of its former glory. That would be to assume a narrow definition of science and cram humanity into it. It might mean that we should expand science to be more humane, fruitful, value laden, and glorious than even it has ever been. We can allow a full and robust vision of our own humanity and assume a definition of science broad enough to contain all of it.\
