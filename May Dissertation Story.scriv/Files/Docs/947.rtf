\f0\fs28 \cf0 ### Empty Definition Objection\
\
Another objection is that the very definition of virtue as a *beneficial* or \'93positive\'94 character trait is circular and therefore empty. To see the problem, suppose we define \'93boldness\'94 as *doing hard things* and \'93courage\'94 as doing hard things when it is good. Boldness is, so to speak, value neutral. One can be bold in wrongdoing or bold in doing well. If courage is just boldness in doing good, is this a trivial truth? An analytic truth? The affirmation that \'91courage (doing hard things when it is good) is good\'92 would appear to amount to the life-altering revelation that 'good things are good'}
