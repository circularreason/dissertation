The AMPK enzyme is one "conserved in all eukaryotic species, that is activated in response to a variety of metabolic stresses that impact cellular energy levels. AMPK activity helps adapt cellular metabolism to match available energy resources through regulation of key enzymes in each major branch of cellular metabolism: fatty acid and sterol synthesis and oxidation, sugar metabolism, protein synthesis."[@jin2007structural]


>One could divide the domain traditionally claimed for teleology into two subprovinces. One is the domain of the notions of function, purpose (fullness [sic]) and “organic wholes” (“systems”). The other is that of aiming and intentionality. Function and purpose figure prominently in the biological sciences, intentionality in the behavioral sciences, social study, and historiography. But the domains of biology and of behavioral science largely overlap and so, of course, do the domains of function, purpose, and wholes on the one hand and that of aiming and intentionality on the other. To distinguish them may nevertheless be useful.[@VonWright1971]

>So, the first fact to keep in mind in reflecting upon the relationship between teleology and intentionality is that they are simply two different concepts; while their semantic ranges do overlap, they are by no means congruent. There is more to our concept of teleology than is contained in our concept of intentionality.[@barham2011 39]


"Teleological Reduction (Teleoreduction): To reduce a putative teleological phenomenon is to give an account of the phenomenon that is both empirically and theoretically adequate and that neither employs any teleological concepts nor presupposes any other teleological phenomena."[@barham2011 108-9]


"...it is of course true that most of the properties of organisms to which we intuitively ascribe teleological characteristics are what are called “biological functions."[@barham2011 111]

"According to this theory (ibid.), the function of a thing is determined by the causal role it plays in—that is, the contribution it makes to—the operation of some larger system. The fundamental problem with this approach lies in the difficulty in explaining exactly what it is about a "causal role" that makes it different from any other causal effect. That is, the challenge is to say what makes certain physical effects of causal processes count as functions, thus differentiating them from all other effects."[@barham2011 111]




>Breaking with this assumption, some new natural design enthusiasts including Dennett (1995), Ruse (2003), Mayr (1989), and Kitcher (1993) have attributed design to biological organisms while denying the necessity of a designer. Dennett writes,
>The key to understanding Darwin's contribution is granting the premise of the argument from design...watches and other designed objects don’t happen; they have to be the product of what modern industry calls “R and D” - research and development...what Darwin saw was that in principle the same work could be done by a different sort of [natural] process.

>An alternative position, the one I favor, is captured by Davies, who says "Darwin did not show us how to understand the world in terms of design despite the absence of a designer; he showed us instead that we ought to stop thinking of the world in terms of design."124 This is more than a mere terminological dispute. A world with natural design would be a metaphysically different place than a world without. Most notably, the concept of design is interconnected with the concept of defect, or an incorrect deviation from a design. Obviously something is able to be "not according to plan" only if there is a plan in the first place.[@ward2013against 67]


>I aim to settle this dispute by showing that a design requires a designer, not by definition, but because designs necessarily must contain information about proper environments – something only a designer can provide.[@ward2013against 67-8]


“A teleonomic process or behavior is one which owes its goal-directedness to the operation of a program...it depends on the existence of some endpoint, goal, or terminus which is foreseen in the program that regulates the behavior.”125 A program is defined as “coded or prearranged information that controls a process (or behavior) leading it toward a given end."[

Though Mayr calls DNA the “blueprint of life,” Dawkins and Dennett point out the blueprint analogy should really be replaced a recipe analogy. What is helpful about their objection is that in making their case against genetic blueprints they actually reinforce their commitment to formal causation generally. When it comes to our genome, say Dawkins and Dennett, a blueprint is the wrong metaphor because a blueprint suggests a one to one mapping of genes to traits as well as a “reversibility” of design; just as one can construct an accurate product by examining a blueprint, one can construct an accurate blueprint by examining a product.129 Yet one cannot examine a cake and necessarily reproduce its recipe – it may be opaque. The same is true, of course, for organisms and their DNA. Furthermore, as Dawkins points out, a recipe is not just a description of a finished cake, but rather “a set of instructions, which, if obeyed in the right order, will result in a cake.”[@ward2013against 69]
