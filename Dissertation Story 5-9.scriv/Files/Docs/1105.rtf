The chapters composing Part I are concerned with the claim that virtue is sufficient to make us happy. This claim resolves into two key premises that (a) humans qua practical reasoners even *have* a telos which virtues enable us to achieve, and that (b) \'93the\'94 human telos (with the definite article) is something like \'93happiness\'94 \'97 taking happiness to be a concept determinate enough to be a helpful starting point but not determinate enough to be final. @annas2011intelligent  argues persuasively that happiness is a more \'93empirical, intuitive\'94 notion than is commonly supposed.\

The chapters concerning Part II are concerned with worries about metaphysical naturalism. This worry resolves into challenges to the claim that (c) human beings are natural, and that therefore (d) our telos and our virtues are natural. The conclusion summarizes our findings, draws some tentative conclusions, and makes suggestions for further research. }
