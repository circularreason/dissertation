\f0\fs28 \cf0 8. **MacIntyre's Motives**\
\
Thomas Nagel and Martha Nussbaum question MacIntyre\'92s conclusions \'97 and even his rationality \'97 by imprecating his motives. They worry that somehow or other, religious or pragmatic motivations have infected his philosophical discourse. They suggest that he has abandoned reason in favor of something irrational. The irrational substitute is either faith, or psychological fear of chaos and neurotic attachment to certainty and order. \
\
Stephen Lutz responds to these criticisms. He points out that they ironically play into MacIntyre\'92s hands. They prove that Nagel and Nussbaum are, in this matter, motivated by hidebound prejudice to surrender to irrationality. }
