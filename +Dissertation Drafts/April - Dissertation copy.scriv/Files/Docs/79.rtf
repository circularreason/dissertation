##Abstract Draft 1\
\
Virtue ethics has gained a resurgence of attention in philosophical as well as psychological and popular conversations about value, human life, happiness, and doing well. Philosophical naturalisms \'97 from the very strict to the more liberal \'97 have also been on the rise. \
\
The momentum of philosophical naturalism may continue until all of nature, life, the self, the cosmos has been subsumed under objective, third-personal categories and explained in objective, descriptive terms or else philosophical naturalism\'92s momentum may be checked by its inability to account for one or more features of (really real) reality. The putative entities that so far have resisted naturalization often include mind, consciousness, reason, practical reason, and value. As such, the naturalist ought to be interested and hopeful in finding or creating an account of value as virtue and of virtue as natural in some salient sense, or at least showing that one is in principle possible. A non-naturalist ought to be interested and hopeful in showing that any such account is in principle impossible, or at least that all such actual accounts are false and inadequate. \
\
This dissertation defends the thesis that all accounts thus far proposed for naturalizing virtue are inadequate, and that such an account is likely to be impossible, while giving due consideration to what the author judges to be the best naturalistic accounts of value and virtue, including reductive, eliminative, non-reductive rationalist, and non-reductive virtue ethical accounts. \
\
\
##Abstract Draft 2\
\
\
Virtue theory, though resuming its popularity in analytic philosophy, has never quite disappeared from folk morality nor broader academic discourse. \
\
The criterion for an adequate metaethics is a satisfying explanation of those phenomena that puzzle us in life as lived, namely certain facts about human evaluative discourse, facts about our reasons for acting or not acting. \
\
Virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is such an explanation, in that it gives accounts for each puzzling explanandum and for all of them as a set.  \
\
Other theories are not so satisfying. For instance, naturalistic neo-Aristotelian virtue theory either sacrifices virtue at the altar of (an ambiguous and ultimately vacuous version) of naturalism or sacrifices (the desired version of) naturalism at the altar of a robust virtue theory. \
\
Naturalistic ethical theories of a consequentialist sort that may be called  \'93welfarist\'94 ignore all goods but human goods, and all human goods but human welfare and those actions that are liable to lead to human welfare. These theories, however sophisticated, have flaws \'97 and moreover are woefully unambitious. \
\
Naturalistic ethical theories of a more scientific flavor also set out to explain explananda but ultimately resort to ignoring or denying the appearances \'97 in other words, they refuse to explain at all. Ignoring phenomena that call for explanation does not do; especially if the explainer continues to help himself to virtue theoretical terms and concepts in daily life while denying their truth and adequacy in theory. \
\
Ultimately, metaethical and ethical theory (discourse about what is good per se and what is good for us) needs enrichment from virtue metaethical theory (specific discourse about virtues, happiness, practical reason) to be fully satisfying. And the ultimate question is not whether such neo-Aristotelian virtue theory is \'93naturalistic\'94 or not; the contentious question is whether it is theistic or not. The question is not whether one can be good without God but whether one who is good can explain goodness without including a god in the account. Finally, the ultimate question is not whether we can get by without a god in our account \'97 we can\'92t \'97 but whether the god is us or someone else. Such questions are, of course, beyond the scope of an inquiry into metaethics. But likewise our theological stance can and should take clues from what seems most the most reasonable metaethical theory. \

##*Abstract Draft 3*\
\
Normative realism is rarely contested because it is so obviously true; moral realism is very often contested but is probably true as well. Virtue theory is making a comeback but is still hotly contested and the truth value of its various (often diverse) theses is far from settled. Naturalism is the new orthodoxy. So a primary research goal is to construct and give naturalistic accounts of normative realism, moral realism, and virtue theory. \
\
Virtue theoretical terms and concepts (not to mention the ethical history) can enrich our most plausible metanormative realist account. However, virtue theory challenges certain naturalistic assumptions that, however desirable they may seem, are at best vague, or trivial, or tautalogous and at worst simply false. \
\
A list of criteria is given for any adequate and satisfying metaethical account. These criteria are explandanda drawn from live as lived.  An account satisfying these criteria -- and explaining these explananda  is given.  This account is a virtue theoretical account that both draws support from metanormative realism and gives support to metanormative realism. Though it is incomplete and subject to important objections, the account is no worse off than rival accounts which have similar holes and suffer similar objections. \
\
Ethical naturalisms that are morally realist are considered. Neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism is found wanting. Scientifically naturalist moral realism is found wanting. \
\
Final clarifications and objections are considered. \

\
My late father, Rich Buhler, once told my uncle \'93Keith dropped out of high school, but he will be the first one in the family to earn a doctorate.\'94 Dad, I hope that I have made you proud. My sister Kristi always believed in me and told me that one day I would be working as a professor. The first person who ordered me to go to graduate school was John Mark Reynolds. John Mark, I have finally fulfilled the plan we dreamed up. J. P. Moreland taught my first graduate school class in philosophy and used tough love and tough arguments to show me how hard and how rewarding this kind of research can be. Without Gary Hartenburg\'92s timely writing advice and hearty encouragement, I could not have survived the application process. David Bradshaw\'92s tireless, patient, gentle, and exacting academic leadership has shown me not only excellent scholarship but an excellent life. My first and final dialectical partner is Lindsay, whose conversations have been the school in which I have learned and still learn to love beauty and truth. \

# Chapter 1: Introduction, Flow of Arguments\
\
### Draft 1\
This dissertation defense the thesis that human virtue and human values are not part of nature in the same way that nonhuman rocks and trees and animal brains are part of nature. \
\
If this thesis is right then either anti-realism is true or non-naturalism is true, but ethical naturalisms (of the extant variety) are unlikely to be true. I assume that anti-realism is false until the final chapter, in which I provide a few brief reasons to think the assumption is true. Non-naturalism I argue to be the most likely true explanation for our understanding of human value and virtue. \
\
* In chapter 1 outline the keywords and key premises and propositions pertaining to this thesis, especially naturalism, non-naturalism in the context of the debate about values like goodness and beauty and virtues like justice, courage, or contentment. \
* In chapter 2, I discuss the historical background of this debate from Democritus and Aristotle through G. E. Moore, Arthur Balfour, and turn of the 21st century. \
* In chapter 3, I critically appraise reductive ethical naturalism as articulated and defended by Richard Boyd, Frank Jackson, Nicholas Sturgeon and others. \
* In chapter 4, I critically appraise non-reductive ethical naturalism as articulated and defended by Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, and others.\
* In chapter 5, I critically appraise neo-Aristotelian naturalism, as articulated and defended by John McDowell, Philippa Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Stephen Brown. \
* In chapter 6, I further explain and defend my own view of morally realist virtue theory in relation to ethical non-naturalism. \
\
### Draft 2\
\
This dissertation defense the thesis that virtue theory is the ethical framework with the most plausibility but that it is incompatible with the type of naturalism that is in 2014 is touted by 49 percent of analytic philosophers. The corollary of this thesis is that either virtue theory or such naturalism must be rejected. \
\
There are three kinds of people that might be interested in the arguments in favor of this thesis and against it, besides those who are generally is interested in ethics and meta-ethics. The first is philosophical naturalists who are on the hunt for a theory of morality that both takes morality seriously and rounds values and virtues and human happiness in nature. The second is those supernaturalists who are interested in arguments for virtue theory and wondered whether virtue theory is somehow aligned with a supernatural metaphysics. The third are virtue as assistants who might be wondering how their distinctly ethical theorizing connects with various broadly metaphysical frameworks.\
\
### Draft 3\
\
This dissertation defends the thesis that human virtue cannot be naturalized but that virtue talk is the best (most practically useful and theoretically plausible) kind of ethical theory we have. In this way, my  metaethical account that can be described as morally realist, non-naturalistic virtue ethics. \
\
There are two kinds of reasons to disbelieve my thesis. The first is allegedly more plausible alternative theories (or anti-theories) of morality: deontology, utilitarianism, moral nihilism of various stripes. The second is objections to my thesis. I shalI respond to each reason. But my responses will not be symmetrical. Regarding the first reason, evaluating the global persuasiveness and plausibility of a single ethical theory as a whole is hard work for one book, let alone all rivals to virtue ethics. So I shall content myself with identifying which plausibility points won by each side if it can explain a few, common, core judgments or values, like that friendship is a good thing, that is laudable to love and wonderful to be loved, and common assessments we make of admirable people. Regarding the second reason, I shall surface as many objections as I can find in the literature, learn from colleagues, and think up myself. I shall polish them up as well as possible and articulate them as sympathetically as possible and then, of course, do the hard work of refuting them as well as possible. \
\
My primary thesis is directed at those who already accept or lean toward virtue theory in general. For those, the reasons to accept virtue theory are redundant; for others, my reasons here to accept virtue theory are liable to be more tantalizing than persuasive. I shall point to the writings of a diverse group of virtue theorists\'97 like Rosalind Hursthouse, Julia Annas, and John McDowell \'97 who are different from each other in many ways but united about virtue. \
\
The question within virtue theory that I want to answer is this: can virtue theory be plausibly naturalistic? Are notions of virtue, happiness, flourishing, and notions of physicalism, naturalized epistemology and so on incompatible? Is neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism either Aristotelian or ethically naturalistic, but not both? I shall argue that they are incompatible. For many of naturalist orientation, this will decrease the global plausibility of virtue ethics. If the notions of virtue, along with honor, chastity, and slavery, are relics of the past, so much the worse for them. Naturalism is the philosophy of the future, for science is the philosophy of the future. But we cannot be too sanguine here. \
\
My secondary thesis is directed to just those who are undecided about virtue theory or already committed to one of it\'92s rivals. The global plausibility of virtue theory in light of a reasonable view of cosmology, politics, and psychology is very high indeed, as others before me have shown. But the global plausibility of naturalism is very high, as well. The tension between the two, if there is any tension, is cause for intellectual concern. Some naturalists have argued that the only alternative to moral realism is moral nihilism, which is such an unattractive position th\
\
In order to make all of this tolerably clear, I shall have to define \'91naturalism.\'92 This is no easy task, and takes up a good bit of space in the chapter x. Naturalism we might call a movement. The momentum it has built, starting nearly 500 years ago, has crested and reached a kind of tipping point. Either naturalism will fulfill its promise of naturalizing not just the cosmos but everything else including mind and value, or naturalism will begin to ebb. Either the naturalists who have been hopeful of the research program in philosophy and outside it will make good on the last remaining pesky puzzles, or, to the astonishment of many, naturalism will prove to be not just incapable at the moment but incapable in principle of developing a comprehensive and satisfying account of both the cosmos and the mind. \
\
\
\
###Draft 4\
This dissertation defends the thesis that virtue is a gift of God. As Plato suggested in Meno, the source of human virtue is not humanity or nature but something outside both humanity and nature. This thesis must be distinguished from a thesis in the vicinity \'97 a thesis much debated in popular forums \'97 about whether one can be \'93good without God.\'94 I think this is like asking whether a gardener can grow plants without the sun. The answer is the gardener needs sunlight but need not believe in the sun to grow plants. Similarly, if virtue is a gift from God, then the virtuous person needs help but need not believe in the Helper to live virtuously and benefit others. \
\
\
###Draft 5\
\
This dissertation advances the thesis that all extant ethical naturalisms are false. The corollaries of this thesis are that we must either elect for ethical non-naturalistic virtue and do so very soon, or else wait perhaps a long time some yet-to-be-defined articulation or yet-to-be-conceived conception of ethical naturalism. \
\
Chapter 1 reviews some of the primary discussions and attempts plausible definitions of some what are called \'91Keywords\'92 in the debate between naturalists and non-naturalists over ethics, including \'91nature, \'91good,\'92 \'91virtue\'92, and \'91human\'92, \'91practical reason,\'92 \'91telos,\'92 and \'91science\'92. \
\
Chapter 2 advances a positive version of virtue ethical theory that provides strong explanatory power over a range of moral platitudes, namely, entrenched folk moral views that seem so right, and why some sophisticated moral theories seem so wrong. Family is important. Friendship is valuable. Cruelty is wrong. The question of whether this virtue theory is \'91naturalistic\'92 is deferred. And the motivation for a naturalistic theory of ethics is highlighted. Some criteria for what our ethical theory should account for are negotiable (say, that my ethical theory should explain why I am always right and others wrong) and, after reflection, ought to be given up. The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are: \
\
1. **Action** \'97 accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport; norms are action-guiding; practical reason gives reasons for practice -- that is, rational action rather than static reason and irrational activity. explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons. \
2. **Character** \'97 accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials.\
3. **Diverse Finite Goods** \'97 accounting for human evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest);\
4. **Heroic Virtue **- accounting for how some exemplary good people become so good; \
5. **Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** \'97  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others;\
6. **Diverse Normativity** \'97 explaining the parity between epistemic and moral norms (in contrast to the absence of a parity between etiquette norms or preferences);\
\
Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. \
\
Chapter X begins a critique of neo-Aristotelian naturalisms.  Aristotelian naturalism of a more phenomenological flavor proposed by Philippa Foot is critiqued. The  Aristotelian naturalism with a scientific flavor proposed by Stephen R. Brown is also examined. The problem of the fact value dichotomy is not overcome by asserting that some of human biology sets normative limits for human flourishing, happiness, and virtue. To speak adequately of all of human flourishing requires speaking of our rational nature and our biology as a union. The metaphysical problem with virtues being my virtues if personal identity has no further grounding than biology is urged. \
\
Chapter x critiques the \'93third alternative\'94 between supernaturalism and reductive naturalism as espoused by Rosalind Hursthouse and John McDowell. The third way is a kind of groundless intersubjectivism wherein no further grounding is required, a non-transcendental idealism that avoids the myth of givenness (that some empirical truths come for free without any interference from our intellect) and the myth of objectivity (that some intellectual truths come for free without any help from our senses). The problem of moral nihilism rears its head. \
\
Chapter x rehearses criticism of various ethical naturalisms, beginning with non-cognitivist naturalism. If virtue ethical moral realism demands supernaturalism, then perhaps it is better to deny realism in general. But non-cognitivism (except expressivism) collapse into moral nihilism, which is not only implausible, but in light of primary, substantive normative and moral questions, morally reprehensible. Expressivism, albeit much more sophisticated and hard to exactly critique, collapses into a kind of ethical skepticism or nihilism that is inconsistent especially with Criterion 4. \
\
Chapter x critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the non-scientific flavor, where the good (say) is an ethical/natural property saliently different from other kinds of natural properties. It then critiques cognitivist ethical naturalism of the scientific flavor, where the good and other values are ethical/natural properties not saliently different from other natural properties like natural kinds. These fail to account for Criterion 3 and 4. \
\
Chapter x answers a few remaining objections, and considers whether (if no satisfying theory of ethical naturalism currently exists) it would be better to trust naturalism and wait for an ethical theory some day, or trust our ethical theory and abandon naturalism today, or very soon. In light of the ambiguity of the term naturalism, this final chapter concludes with some suggested re-conceptualizations of the five Keywords. \
\
\
\
\
### Draft 6\
\
That we ought to love each other is true if anything is true. Life as lived is puzzling. Among the many puzzles that confront us, some of the most enduringly fun and bewildering are ethical puzzles about how we know what is good and whether there is a good at all.  These questions are given a special bite. \
\
This dissertation advances a naturalistic metaethical theory that combines moral realism and virtue theory. My thesis involves three claims: that nature consists of some normative facts and other facts in a radical continuity, that at least some those facts can be and in some cases are known, and that knowing and acting on them is (for rational creatures like us) the best way to live.\
\
The question of naturalism will occupy much of our discussion. And it will take us into the *metaphysical* side of metaethical debates. I for one enjoy the variety of discussants and styles across philosophical metaphysicians and ethicists, but some may find the presence of so much metaphysical discussion strange alongside so much ethical discussion. \
\
Normative ethical theories (about duty, virtue, pleasure, the divine will, etc.) are normally taken to be competing and non-trivially distinct from metaethical theories about what grounds duties, virtues, human pleasure, God's decrees, etc. This received wisdom is wise. And yet, to paraphrase Thomas Nagel, sanity in our metaethics is most preserved by keeping primary ethical concerns near to our mind.\
\
Explanations explain phenomena that puzzle us. There are, in many cases, competing explanations that can't both be true but that are both plausible. If I find a broken window in my home office and a stick on the ground, on the face it may be that some neighborhood menace was breaking windows for fun, or that my tree outside lost a branch in the wind. An explanation is (always?) underdetermined by the data. \
 \
There are two ways to offer an explanation: as an argument (contending against others) or as a framework (aiming for consistency and coherency and plausibility). When offering the first kind of explanation qua argument it is necessary to attack other frameworks and defend one's own. When offering the second kind of explanation it is necessary to fully explicate the theory, drawing out aspects and clarifying or defending them. The plausibility of a framework then depends, for the reader, on how plausible and satisfying the framework is as a whole rather than the relatively less satisfying alternatives. \

7. Objections, Clarifications, and Conclusions (What is Really Scientific)\
\
\
There are two ways the reader might take my main claim: firstly, as a query about virtue ethics, whether it can be naturalistic or not; secondly, as a query about ethical naturalism, whether it can be made plausible or not. Admittedly these questions are distinct and can be treated separately. But insofar as writers like Hursthouse, Foot, and McDowell address them as a unity, I shall follow suit. \
\
One reason I love reading Plato is that he never builds straw men. Not all dialogists in the history of philosophy have been purely intellectually honest. But Plato's characters are almost always real like Shakespeare's characters are real. They may be ridiculous -- especially the interlocuters, but Socrates too-- they may be mad, they may be uproarioiusly funny, but they are always real. They are funny in the way real interlocuters are funny. They are ridiculous the way some of my undergradutes are ridiculous. They are mad the way some in my own family are mad. Plato's passion for giving the devil his due lead him to write (or one of his very gifted students to write) dialogues in which Socrates "loses". In *Cleitophon*, the eponymous character -- not Socrates -- gets the last word. If Plato intends his reader to disagree with Cleitophon, if he intends the reader to see the error in Cleitophon's thinking or in his character, that intention is buried layers deep in an intention to let Cleitophon speak with authenticity. Cleitophon's error, if he is in error, must be shown in the clearest relief, the brightest light, his own arguments through his own words in his own voice. The reader has to do the work to unbury the error. Or, finding the error, to let the dead bury their own dead. \
\
While writing a platonic dialogue is a form of art I still find appealing and still use, that is not the best vehicle for this dissertation. So I am forced to give the views I think mistaken the best hearing I can give them in my own voice. \
\
The challenge of metaethical inquiry, I think, is to engage readers who do not already agree with you. A constant danger to which we are all liable is assuming too many crucial propositions and arguging at length about a bunch of relatively peripheral propositions. Metaethicists who steer clear of this danger are the likes of Alan Gibbard and Robert Adams. There is some value to articulating, clarifying, and defending a view that reader and author both (already) share. But that is not the valuable enterprise I aim for. \
\
The test, I think, shall be whether these pages find readers who disagree with the core thesis I present in Chapter 3, and, if so, whether they can recognize "their own" purported view in the pages that follow. If they can not only recognize but resoundingly affirm the view expressed in that chapter, then my objections may have some bite and may earn the high honor of receiving a rebuttal. \
\
It would not be a failure if no one found these pages; most such essays do not find readers, even if they deserve them. Failure would be for some ethical naturalist to pick up the book or a chapter on a shelf or online, glance at the view expressed, and to disown what I claim is his own. \
\
I have done my best within the following chapters to detail my assumptions as quasi-axioms or quasi-data to be examined and explained. I have also done my best to formalize (in short, numbered, propositional forms) the arguments I endeavor to lay out and defend in paragraphs. The benefit of offering formalized versions of my own arguments is that they may clarify for readers exactly what is being offered for their consideration. The risk of offering proposition-unit versions that are shorter than the paragraph-unit versions is that some discrepancy may arise between the two, and the readers be forced to do an initial interpretive work of figuring out exactly which argument they ought to consider. \
\
My theses are these:\
\
1. There exist some real primary norms (both epistemic and ethical) that are binding on us *qua* human beings. \
2.  These norms are in some cases, knowable and effable. \
\
Examples of such norms are 'proportion your belief to the evidence' and 'be kind to others.' \
\
If such norms are 'real' then they are mind-independent, true regardless of human opinion, etc. \
\
If they are 'binding on us qua human beings' then they truly prescibe over all creatures with practical rationality -- in other words, all creatures like us and all other potential creatures we might discover or be discovered by one day. \
\
I say 'some real norms' because, of course, not all norms are real. Norms of, say, spelling English words I take to be purely or mostly conventional. Drawing up lists of exactly which norms are real independent of human thought and which are human concepts is of course a difficult task. My task is simply to defend that the list of mind-independent norms has at least one item. \
\
The main rivals to the above theses are epistemic and moral nihilists, expressivists, and error theorists.  Some say such norms just don't exist except as concepts or social structures. Others say that if such norms existed they do not explain how we think and talk. So the arguments that such norms really exist are metanormative explanations of the way we talk, the way we act, and the we we (necessarily) think. \
\
But even among those who agree with the above theses are divided. Not everyone who agrees with the first two agree with each other. These norms seem to defy fact/value distinctions. They are evaluative facts, or factual prescriptions. At least, if they are "just values" then the fact/value gap becomes a problem. If they are fact-values then there is no gap to be overcome. But some philosophers become indignant at the notion of evaluative facts: what in the world could such strange things be? \
\
This leads to the question of whether ethical norms are 'natural'?  Are moral facts, or what I am calling simply 'norms' natural? This seems like a pressing and substantive question whose answer will affect alot. After doing the research for this dissertation, I no longer think it is a pressing or substantive question. It is not just vague but hopelessly vague; not just ambiguous but fatally ambiguous. \
\
4. Are these norms "natural"?\
	* Are these norms radically anamolous? Are they strange, queer, discontinuous? \
	* Are such norms physical/material? (Nagel, McDowell)\
	* Are such norms divine? \
5. Where do such norms come from? Do they happen to emerge from our biology? Do they come from the mouth of a god? Are they necessary features of our rational nature and other other creatures with a rational nature? \
\
My claim is that: \
\
1. These norms are 'natural' but that the question 'Is X natural?' is almost vacuous. \
	* These norms are not radically anomolous. They are not strange, queer, discontinous.  (Nagel)\
	* These norms are not material. (Nagel, McDowell)\
	* These norms are not emergent properties arising from our biology. (Foot, Brown)\
5. These norms are internally related to human nature (via practical rationality). (Foot, McDowell, Kant)\
\
For the purpose of these essays, I remain agnostic as to whether these norms come from any particular personal god. But I do claim that they are divine. The contrast is likely to strike the reader as strange. By 'divine' I mean that they transcend our animal biology and that conformity to them makes us rational, acting creatures full of wisdom and virtue.  Affirming the divinity of some norms is consonant with a variety of theistic views: Aristotle's god is neither Brahman nor Jehovah. \
\
But insofar as 'natualist' is just a label for 'atheist,' then my argument entails that naturalism is false. But I deny the charge that my view is "non-naturalistic." Insofar as 'naturalist' is a label for 'one who believes in the radical continuity of facts, the uniformity and harmony of reality,' I vehemently claim the label as my own. In order to claim the label as my own, I must show that they are mistaken who think reality is radically continuous because reality is fundamentally physical or material. \
\
The best evidence that reality is not fundamentally material is human nature, rationality and practical rationality, including primary norms. \
\
\
##### Draft 7\
\
This dissertation defends the claim that some moral and epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents, and that such norms are best explained in terms of human nature (what we are), human flourishing (our end), and human virtues which are the means to flourishing. \
\
There is a danger that labels, which are useful for categorization, storage, and quick reference of arguments and beliefs, become more important than substantive arguments. Let me say here how I would label my view in terms of the labels fashionable in the early 2000s, and thereafter avoid trivial disputes. I take my metaethical view to be a brand of normative realism, emphasizing moral norms but using epistemic norms as allies. I take my ethical view to be a brand of virtue ethics. Talk about virtues, human nature, and flourishing or happiness I find the most helpful in solving knotty metaethical puzzles. Sometimes, as Thomas Nagel reminds me, the only solution to metaethical puzzles is to stick to primary ethical tools. \
\
The main rivals to my claim are: (a) the belief that no moral or epistemic norms are real and binding on all rational agents; or and a group of views (b) that such norms are indeed real but best understood in other terms. There are several rivals of this second class. In order of decreasing similarity to my own conclusion, beginning with *most* similar, they are: \
\
|Rival claim | Thinker | Label |\
|-----|--------|------------|----------|\
|* b1. Real norms are best understood as features of our human nature  | (McDowell) |Ethical naturalism\
|* b5. Real norms are best understood as features of our rational minds | (Kant) | Ethical Rationalism\
|* b4. Real norms are best understood as features of our social group | (MacIntyre?)| Social construct\
|* b3. Real norms are best understood as features of our animal nature | (Foot)| Naturalism\
|* b2. Real norms are best understood as features of the "natural world" |(Boyd)| Ethical naturalism\
\
It will be quickly noticed that several of these views fly under the heading of 'naturalism'.  Hence I move to dispense with the titles. Instead, clarifying the claims, I shall argue for and against each claim in its own terms. In the final chapter I shall pick up the question of labels and definitions, again, after the dust has settled. \
\
There are a series of questions to which the best answer is "there are real norms or laws of thought and behavior that govern creatures like us." I lay out [a number] of criteria for what an adequate metaethical theory should explain. These criteria are, I hope, non-controversial, eminently common phenomena that we can all relate to. \
\
My first task in defending my primary thesis *could have been* to rehearse some of the arguments against normative nihilism, norm expressivism, etc. Instead, I shall argue that normative realism is a reasonable "defeasible presumption"[^14] that we ought to trust unless weighty objections arise. I then show that 'naturalism' provides exactly such weighty objections. But 'naturalism' is a a "philosopher's weasel-word."[^15] A naturalistic thesis, when clarified, will turn out to be one of a few kinds of thesis: \
\
[^15]:  Borrowing Terrence Cuneo's term from *The Normative Web*. \
\
* a trivial common sense metaphysical thesis; -- all that is real is real \
* a slightly less trivial anti-idealist metaphysical thesis; -- all that is material is real\
* a universal reductive materialist thesis;  -- all that is real is material; nothing that is real is non-material\
* or an atheistic thesis; -- nothing that is real is supernatural (i.e., God) [^16]\
\
[^16]: Some might think that the reductive materialist thesis is for all intents and purposes identical to the atheistic thesis. But idoloters think that their god is material and pantheists think that matter too is god. \
\
So I reframe the so-called 'naturalists objection' in these three ways. The core objection I call the "argument from radical discontinuity."  The argument from radical discontinuity, or disharmony, finds various expressions in various books and articles but has, I think, one root. That root is important and true. I show how my account satisfies that search for radical continuity. So how does my account fare with respect to so-called naturalism, after disambiguation? I detail how my account \
\
*  agrees with 'naturalism' qua trivial metaphysical thesis; \
* disagrees with 'naturalism' qua reductively materialistic thesis\
* does not disagree with 'naturalism' qua atheistic thesis. \
\
		It is indeterminate with respect to theism or atheism, though it fits better with theism. (My account makes theism more plausible and atheism less plausible. But it is not inconsistent with atheism nor does it entail theism. I call such a weak relationship a "fit" but indeterminate.)\
\
		Some will find it strange that I argue for *holiness* without necessarily invoking religion, or *divinity* without necessarily attaching it to a god. It is strange, but not uncommon. Laozi's eternal Tao is divine without being a god. Aristotle's *nous* is a god without being a person. Even Kant's Christian God is not quite Swinburne's Christian God, with purposes, plans, and personality. I take my argument to be a conclusion about signs. The nature and reality of the signified is a whole different discussion. Could someone, beginning from the existence of a sign that most clearly points to a signified, make an argument that the signified in fact exists? Yes. Could someone else deny the signified, reinterpreting the sign? Yes. But both acknowledge and admit the existence and nature of the sign, including that it seems to point beyond itself. That's all I can hope for here. \
	\
\
With these clarifications in hand, I proceed to examine the various rival views as espoused by their best proponents.  They all accept the reality of evaluative norms but explain them differently, offering different metaphysical frameworks and anthropological frameworks. I attempt to show in detail how each rival either misteps or goes only part of the way in the right direction. It misteps by invalidating one of our criteria. It only goes part of the way by only including some of our criteria, ignoring or disregarding the others. \
\
Having removed the teeth from the overriding motivation to be "naturalistic", these rival views turn out simply to be half-hearted substitutes for virtue. They are not even properly "rivals" nor are they clear-headed. The clear-headed work to be done is to clarify objections to virtue theory and articulate better answers and explanations. \
\
Finally, I consider objections that might show my claim to be false or otherwise inadequate (implausible, trivial, or useless). The biggest of these is that my conclusion does not "secure" the natural world from "outside" influence. The fear can be variously expressed: *You have not protected us from god.* Since I do not think that such laws are circuscribed to *humans*, the fear that there may be something or someone *else* out there -- be they aliens, angels, or gods -- is not a fear that should disturb our rational reflection on these questions. I reflect on the relation between my claim and theism. \
\
The conclusion of all this is that some kind of virtue theoretical account is not only truest but most useful. My claim, if true, helps to vindicate the excellent work in virtue ethics that is being done all over the world. It also vindicates the practical work of those leaders, parents, politicians, medical doctors, pastors, and professors, who deploy terms like 'virtue' and 'happiness' to motivate themselves and others in their care. \
\
The essays comprising this dissertation unfortunately defy categorization. The normative considerations in the first and last chapters might be called applied ethical. After all, we are trying to give good reasons and hear good reasons for our metaethical theory in order to *know* what to do with our ethical theories, and we care about our ethical theories (in part) because we care about our lives. We want to lie well, not badly. The "metaphysics of ethics" we must do (in response to Kant and Frank Jackson) to get a hold on human nature and the norms to which we are naturally sensitive requires a bit of metaphysical legwork. And, of course, there will inevitably be some room for moral epistemology, semantics, and moral motivation. With the great danger ever present that on any of these various topics I will mistep, I trust in the reader not to scoff but to correct, not to laugh but to help me learn.  \

#Chapter 2 Literature Review (Historical Background, Keywords)\
\
##On the Concept of Nature\
John Dewey described himself as a naturalist. I am not sure what he meant by this self-ascription. I am not sure anyone else is sure. What does the term naturalist mean? \
\
Those who hope for any help from etymology will be disappointed. The word nature comes to us from Latin natura. The Greek correlate is physis, which means roughly \'93that which grows\'94 [^1]\

\
Aristotle distinguishes nature from art by nature having in itself the source of motion while art has its source of motion from without. The Oxford English Dictionary lists a bafflingly wide range of entries on the term nature.  The major supergroups are senses relating either to \'93bodily strength\'94 or \'93mental or physical impulses\'94 or \'93innate character.\'94 Examples include sexual urges of an animal, the character of a human, essential qualities of anything, including God. A sermon from 17th century preacher Robert South on Job urges that \'93God would not act sutably, and congruously, to the Equity and Goodness of his Nature, if He should not reward it.\'94  [^10]\

\
John McDowell describes himself as a naturalist by which he means to avoid the \'93fear of supernaturalism"[@mcdowell.mw 84] \
\
McDowell would find it strange to hear from Reverend South a discussion of the nature of God called a naturalistic discussion, but it is hard to see how McDowell or anyone can block such usages of the term except by excluding them by definition.\
\
###A quick example of non-overlapping sets of definitions for overlapping sets of terms\
Keywords: Nature, Practical Reason, Human, Science, Goodness. Humans are part of nature, and so is goodness, and it can be known by science.\
\
Compare these two statements: \
\
1. Humans are merely wetware meat machines, and goodness is whatever property conduces to our biological flourishing and genotype reproductive success, and such properties can be discovered, categorized, and exhaustively researched by physical, biological, psychological, and sociological sciences.\
\
OR\
\
2. Humans are one of the entities in existence, and so is the form of good, which can be known, and goodness is whatever participates in the Good, which for us is the flourishing of our rational nature, which can be known and taught through tradition, including metaphysics, psychology, ethical inquiry, revelation, and experience.\
\
Both deploy the keywords above systematically. But the interlocking system of meanings of each term individually together in these sentences is different. The metaethical frameworks deploying these keywords might seem incommensurable. I don't think they are. Two consistent systems can be judged relative to eachother by picking out one or two particular claims each makes and discerning which seems most likely to be true. The "winner" of that judgment points us to the system in which it is embedded. \
\

\
##Democritus and Lucretius\
While this dissertation\'92s main interlocutors are contemporary, it helps to include some older friends and foes in the conversation. Considering the historical context of a debate is often useful, sometimes irrelevant, but never harmful. However abstract, timeless, and almost mathematical the arguments for and against a proposition, it sometimes helps to know who has defended and attacked it before, how they have done so, and what other truth-claims and behavioral maxims are organically related to that proposition. \
\
For this reason, I begin my literature review not with G. E. Moore but with Democritus. \
\
The theorizing of Democritus is important for my purposes in two ways: his end (continuity) and his means (matter). (1) He desired an account that afforded radical continuity of explanation. And (2) his account found that continuity in material objects. \
\
##Lucretius\
Lucretius puts the lie to the whole notion that modern materialism, or contemporary physicalism, is a recent discovery and a sort of philosophical upshot of the modern scientific revolution. \
\
\
##Arthur Balfour and Lloyd Morgan\
\
About the same time that G. E. Moore was busy inventing analytic metaethics, the British philosopher and politician Arthur Balfour was composing a fascinating monograph called *Theism and Humanism.* Arthur Balfour\'92s *Theism and Humanism* develops an argument from naturalism against naturalism that runs as follows: \
\
>[There is] no distinction to be drawn between the development of reason and that of any other faculty, physiological or psychical, by which the interests of the individual or the race are promoted. From the humblest form of nervous irritation at the one end of the scale, to the reasoning capacity of the most advanced races at the other, everything without exception (sensation, instinct, desire, volition) has been produced directly or indirectly, by natural causes acting for the most part on strictly utilitarian principles. Convenience, not knowledge, therefore, has been the main end to which this process has tended.[@balfour 68].\
\
And again: \
>Taking naturalism as our guiding principle we can hardly doubt that the august sentiments which cling to the ideas of duty and sacrifice are nothing better than a device of nature to trick us into the performance of altruistic actions.[@balfour 15]\
\
In my own words: \
any conclusion is false if the conclusion of the argument contradicts the objective truth-finding ability of the very faculty of reason by which we gathered the premises in favor of the conclusion.  \
Let A be the proposition that: reason is a truth-finding faculty that is at least occasionally reliable at discovering true propositions. \
Let B be the proposition that: Natural selection is responsible for the state of the current state of the brain, its functions, abilities, etc. \
And let C be the proposition that: Natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties. \
\
1. If A then B.\
2. If B then C.\
3. A. \
3. B.\
4. Therefore C. \
5. If C, then not-A. \
6. Not-A. \
\
1. The brain exhibits truth-finding properties, then we can learn that natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties. \
2. If natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties only,  4. natural selection is entirely responsible for the brain's functioning, \
3. The brain exhibits truth-finding properties\
4. natural selection is entirely responsible for the brain's functioning, \
If natural selection selects for survival-conducive properties only, then the brain does not exhibit truth-finding properties. \
5. The brain does not exhibit truth-finding properties. \
\
\
\
This argument type is picked up by a philosophical if popular journalist (G. K. Chesterton in *Orthodoxy*), a philosophical and literary scholar (C. S. Lewis in *Miracles*), and contemporary philosophers (Alvin Plantinga in *Where the Conflict Really Lies*, and Thomas Nagel in *Mind and Cosmos*). \
\
The problem with the argument is not only that it contains a contradiction (that is bad enough). The problem is also that it undermines *all truth claims* including, of course, the truth claims that lead us to believe in things like natural selection. \
\
Lloyd Morgan\'92s review of Balfour\'92s book calls it \'93one of the most remarkable books of modern times.\'94[@morgan] Yet he differs from Balfour\'92s conclusions on almost every point. His responses are instructive. Morgan sees that natural selection produce humans, but that humans and rationality have advanced beyond the initial state produced. Natural selection, we might say, is only the indirect producer of human rationality, ethical ideals, and so on. \
\
Furthermore, naturalism is not opposed to supernaturalism. \'93[W]e are far from denying the existence or the all-pervading influence of the supernatural ; nay, rather we are laying firmly the foundations of a belief based not on rationalism, but on idealism. We contend for the natural and intrinsic nobility of man at his best and highest, and see therein the foundations of his religious ideals.\'94[@morgan 84] Morgan does not flesh out these contentions much. But he somehow sees in naturalism not a refutation of \'93supernaturalism\'94 or idealism but a basis for it. \
\
Morgan\'92s naturalism is simply a method of sticking \'93close to the realities that are given in practical experience; and to remember that every step in analysis takes us so much further from the reality from which we start.\'94[@morgan 86] By this light, the physicist who says a tree in the next field is \'93nothing but matter and energy\'94 and the psychologist who says the tree is \'93nothing but sensations ... combined\'94 may both be right but there is also a tree in the next field. The bottom line is that the \'93criterion of reality\'94 is \'93direct experience\'94 rather than \'93that which remains after the most ... rigorous analysis\'94 [@morgan 88]. Morgan affirms both sides of the objective/subjective divide, whether the results of intense experimental study or intense introspective analysis, since \'93nothing ... can be more real than a bit of practical experience in the moment of that experience; and if in analysis we distinguish therein an objective aspect on the one hand and a subjective aspect on the other hand, let us remember that these two are of strictly co-ordinate reality.\'94[@morgan 89]\
\
##G. E. Moore\
G.E. Moore is well known as a non-naturalist. He is less widely-known as a consequentialist. My thesis combines metaethical realism with virtue theory and so includes but does not limit itself to consequentialist theses. Consequentialism is opposed to virtue theory, but not diametrically opposed. \
\
\
## Contemporary Naturalism of a Paradigmatic Sort\
Contemporary naturalism follows Democritus and Lucretius on the two main points, the end goal and the means thereto.\
\
According to David Papineau, naturalism is not just a banner under which to gather or a vacuous slogan like \'93world peace!\'94 Alyssa Ney argues that naturalism is not a truth claim with propositional content but an oath or a vow to follow science wherever it leads. In this sense, I am a naturalist. According to Alvin Plantinga, naturalism is simply atheism plus. In this sense, I am not a naturalist. When avowing a term requires appending a series of checkboxes detailing what one does and doesn\'92t mean by the term, it seems high time to either rethink or retire the term. \

#Chapter x - Six Criteria Lock, Virtue Key (My view)\
\
This chapter advances my view. \
\
My metaethical theory is a positive version of virtue ethical theory that provides strong explanatory power over a range of moral platitudes, namely, entrenched folk moral views that seem so right, and why some sophisticated moral theories seem so wrong: Family is important. Friendship is valuable. Cruelty is wrong. The question of whether this virtue theory is \'91naturalistic\'92 is deferred. And the motivation for a naturalistic theory of ethics is highlighted. Some criteria for what our ethical theory should account for are negotiable (say, that my ethical theory should explain why I am always right and others wrong) and, after reflection, ought to be given up. The criteria suggested as non-negotiable explananda are: \
\
1. **Action** \'97 accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport;\
2. **Character** \'97 accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials.\
6. **Diverse Normativity** \'97 explaining the parity between epistemic and moral norms, modal "norms" or laws, aesthetic norms (in contrast to the absence of a parity between etiquette norms or preferences);\
3. **Diverse Finite Goods** \'97 accounting for human evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest);\
4. **Heroic Virtue**- accounting for how some people become so good they are exemplary, they become saints or sages; \
5. **Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** \'97  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others; we know for instance that cruelty is bad and kindness good more firmly and clearly and irrefutably and incorrigibly than we know some obvious non-normative facts like that ice is cold or objects fall toward the earth (the exceptions are imaginable, even though surprising); \
7. **Practical Reason** - explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons. \
\
Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. \
\
Each of these needs a defense. \
\
\
#### Draft 2\
\
1. **Good (values, truth, beauty, goodness, order)- Unity and diversity of non-human and human goodness** - The star are beautiful, the ecosystem is healty, the bee hive is flourishing, a solar system is forming, that father and son are finally reconciling, their friendship has lasted, the truth is good, goodness is real, virtue is its own reward, rational beings ought to proportion belief to the evidence, real scientists don't fabricate data, simultaneously to hold inconsistent beliefs makes one irrational; accounting for  evaluative discourse about everything else, including non-humans (animals, plants, insects, etc.), and inanimate matter (mountains, deep space, the ocean, the rainforest); [The plurality of goodness, varieties of goodness, varieties of value]\
 * Order is good in a very different way from truth.\
\
\
2. **Virtue (moral and intellectual)- Uniity and diversity of human goodness in chracter, thought, action ** - accounting for human evaluative discourse about the character of humans, including ourselves, others and even hypothetical persons like gods, angels, or intelligent extraterrestrials. \
	* That was wrong, but you're not a bad person; \
	* Pat did well for once; \
	* accounting for human evaluative discourse about human actions, especially objective purport; norms are action-guiding; practical reason gives reasons for practice -- that is, rational action rather than static reason and irrational activity. explaining how and why it is we act not just on desires but for *reasons*, and that there seems to be no systemic or in principle difference between prudential, moral, and other reasons.\
	* Parents ought to care for their children and children ought to respect their parents;\
	* Friends ought to remain faithful even in times of sorrow and trouble;\
	* Word and deed, thought and action, intellect and will -- these exhaust what we judge ourselves and others for\
	* Examples: \
* those people are courageous; \
* Sam is wise;\
* Jose did the right thing, \
* Lindsay has earned it; \
* Willfully to disregard the evidence for historical atrocities against people groups whom you happen to dislike is an intellectual *and* a moral error\
* Ignoring evidence contradicting your hypothesis is an intellectual error;\
* Falsifying evidence to support your hypothesis;  \
\
3. Unity and diversity of human individual and collective good. \
* As political creatures, if the family, society, and state are flourishing, it is likely to be easier for me to flourish.\
* As individuals, if I am flourishing it is likely to be easier for the polity, the society, and the family to flourish. \
* Often times promoting the general welfare demands that I sacrifice my personal welfare -- or at least my personal pleasure, comfort. Example: %\
* Often times promoting the specific welfare of myself, my family, or my friends demands that I sacrifice the general welfare -- or at least the general convenience, efficiency. Example: Giving children the right to an education means helping even first-generation families to struggle through all the challenges of enculturation in school. \
\
	\
3. **Moral knowledge and ignorance -- Openness, or Pursuing without Grasping** \'97  explaining how we know some ethical truths certainly and are abysmally ignorant about others;\
	* I am more certain that I ought to honor my father's memory than I am that atoms exist. \
	* I am more clear that I ought to care for my children than I am that Pluto is or is not a planet.\
	* I am more justified in believing that I ought to trust my wife when I am absent than I am justified in believing that most of the dinosaurs were eradicated by a catastrophic cosmological event. \
	* Cruelty is wrong, kindness is good; to be open to reconsidering these platitudes constitutes a moral failing. \
	* Under this heading we can say that we seem so obviously to *know* certain moral judgments are true (cruelty is bad, kindness is good) and that they are true *about* certain moral facts (crulety, kindness)\
 \
4. **Superlative human goodness**  - that firefighter is paragon of courage, Sam is a sage, Jose always does the right thing, Lindsay deserves every blessing she has; accounting for how some exemplary good people become so good; how some people become exemplary villains, examples of vice, debasement, wretchedness, and misery. \
\
\
Virtue theory (whether naturalistic or no) offers a satisfying story that explains each of these explananda individually and (even more satisfyingly) as a set. Despite the problems of virtue theory and objections thereto, none of the theoretical costs seems as high as jettisoning a ready-made explanation of one of these # criteria. The challenge is posed to others to offer better explanations individually or as a whole. \
\
Each of these needs some comment. Objections could be levelled against my choice of explananda to the effect that cherry-picking explananda is a way of fixing the race in favor of one or another future explanation. \
\
	All that God made is good. Jack and Jill live in a beautiful meadow. Jack is a virtuous fellow and Jill wise. Their children are decent, but they have big shoes to fill. I'm not sure whether Jack is a doctor or a farmer, but he has helped me and my family. \
\
\
My reply to this objection is that (a) other theories *could* account for them; virtue theory just accounts for them more and more satisfyingly, and (b) each explanandum is a common, obvious, public phenomenon that calls for explanation. They are not the *only* things puzzling about live as lived, but they are major puzzles. \
\
To defend the first criterion, I have assembled a sort of sample from art, literature, reality television, anecdotal examples, history, and political discourse. The specimens of this sample are not, clearly, chosen at random. They were chosen with the criterion in mind. If my point were to show the features of a random sample, this sample would be a poor one. But that is not my point. Rather, I am to show *how easy* it is to gather examples of normative evaluations of various kinds deploying identical (English) terms for an apparent diversity of phenomena. \
\
\
\
# Chapter x Virtue Theory of a Paradigmatic Sort\
\
\
The explanans I prefer and shall defend against a few of its rivals is a morally realist virtue theoretical account. The criteria laid out [in chapter X] I have already defended in part. The worst academic sin I could commit early on would be to beg the question against a rival explanans merely by cherry-picking explananda. But other possible pecadillos remain. [I shall attempt to rebut below those that seem most threatening.]  \
\
In this chapter, I shall spell out a paradigmatic sort of morally realist virtue theory, drawn from Aristotle with modifications by Aquinas with extra modifications by MacIntyre and others. Needless to say, one need not be a Roman Catholic theist to appreciate what is true in Aquinas\'92 account any more than one need be an aristocratic Greek polytheist to appreciate what is true in Aristotle\'92s account. \
\
I shall say only briefly what exact sense (out of a dozen possible senses) I mean by \'91morally realist\'92. The reader may rest assured that I mean nothing radically new or unique here. I shall then [spend a bit more time to] make explicit how metaethical discourse enriched by words like \'91virtue\'92, \'91happiness,\'92 and \'91harmony\'92 can satisfy the criteria above; how such discourse explains \'97 individually and as a group \'97 the puzzling facts about humanity and normativity. \
\
\
## The criteria/explananda\
Let\'92s recall our explananda: \
\
* A good person is one who has achieved a good set of character traits and employs or \'93activates\'94 them habitually; a bad person is the opposite. \
* Evaluative discourse about people, judging them as good, beautiful, faithful, friendly or the opposite of these, paradigmatically consists in judging not only their actions but especially these character traits. \
* Some people are not just decent but exceptionally admirable, heroically virtuous. \
* Evaluative discourse about everything else deploys value terms like goodness, truth, beauty and their opposites to describe or evaluate non-human objects (stars, rocks, forests), non-human animals (deer, dogs, buzzards), and systems (ecosystems, galaxies) according to normative canons other than moral ones. (Cf. (Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, Chapter 3 \'93Well-Being and Excellence\'94).  \
* There is a parity between evaluative discourse endorsing moral norms and evaluative discourse endorsing epistemic norms (where there is no identical parity between evaluative discourse about, say, etiquette).  \
* Evaluative discourse purports to be objective. \
* Some evaluative judgments purport to be known with an absolute and incorrigible certainty while others purport to be only guessed at, hoped for, glimpsed \'93through a glass darkly.\'94\
\
Michael Smith summarizes the "features of morality" as (1) "we seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts" and (2) regarding practicality, "moral judgments seem to be, or imply, opinions about the reasons we have for behaving in certain ways and, other things being equal, having such opinions is a matter of finding ourselves with a corresponding motivation to act" (Smith 1994, 6-7). Of course, Smith thinks these features are opposite each other. Beliefs  -- correct or incorrect -- about facts are "utterly distinct" from desires, and never the twain shall meet (Smith, 1994, 8). \
\
\
## Virtue Theory in general virtues and vices\
To quote Philippa Foot, \'93virtues are, in some general way, beneficial.\'94 Virtues, like frankness or courage are habitual activities that benefit the possessor and the community of which the possessor is a member. \
\
Foot thinks it a weakness that Greek sense of arete and the Latin sense of virtues include non-moral excellence. Robert Adams thinks this a strength, since moral excellence (he argues) is a species of excellence per se (Adams, Finite and Infinite Goods, Chapter 3 \'93Well-Being and Excellence). \
\
Practical wisdom was counted as a moral virtue by the ancients, while we see it as an intellectual virtue. Which is it? Wisdom is connected, according to Foot, with action or the will, namely \'93knowledge of how to act well\'94 in general matters such as friendship, marriage, parenting, and career, and knowledge of how to pick good ends. \'93Cleverness\'94 may be knowledge of how to coordinate efficient means to any end, but wisdom \'93presupposes good ends\'94 (5). A second part of wisdom, Foot thinks, has to do with the \'93curiously elusive\'94 that that \'93some pursuits are more worthwhile than others\'94 (6). Borderline cases are always liable to dispute. But someone who consistently values (say) worldly position over health and family relationships I judge to be foolish in that regard, and I assume most of my readers agree. \
\
Foot also argues for her version of Aristotle\'92s dictum that \'93virtues are about what is difficult for men\'94 (8). That is, for any given virtue (such as justice) there are temptations \'97 often strong temptations \'97 to do what is vicious (such as overweening desires for wealth or overweening fear of criticism). \
\
Foot considers one puzzle about virtue theory that gave Kant much trouble. If virtues are \'93correctives\'94 to tempting errors endemic to human nature (like the temptation to overindulge in the sensual), then is someone who struggles and works hard to do well more or less virtuous? Suppose a man does not steal when his circumstances practically beg him to steal: he can easily get away with it, no one will know, the thing he could steal will greatly benefit him and its loss will not greatly harm its owner, etc. He seems more virtuous because he overcame more in his pursuit of virtue; he seems less virtuous because he had to employ extrinsic motivation to get himself to do good. Kant concluded that actions done for other motives besides dutiful motives don\'92t have moral worth (Cf. Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, I). Foot charitably offers only one corrective to this conclusion: \'93Some actions are in accordance with virtue without requiring virtue for their performance, whereas others are both in accordance with virtue and such as to show possession of a virtue\'94 (13). An action done in accordance with virtue (like self-preservation) but that does not \'91display a virtue\'92 has little to no moral worth, because it arises out of natural self-love. But that same action, under different circumstances, may display virtue \'97 as when someone is strongly tempted to suicide but resists, preserves themselves, through courage and hope. Similarly, doing an action that one finds enjoyable (even if that action is philanthropic action) is in accord with virtue but becomes a truly virtuous action when it is done in the face of resistance. \
\
>Can virtues be used to bad ends? For example, can the villainous criminal persist in robbing a bank through his great courage? Since it is \'93good for a blind horse to be slow\'94 it would be worse in a sense for an avaricious man to be courageous. There seems to be some analytic contradiction in saying \'91courage makes him bad\'92. That trait that benefits him harms him. Should we give up the intuitive definition of virtues as bestowing benefits? What are the alternatives? Either courage is not a virtue or the bank robber\'92s action is not courageous. Foot considers that the power a virtue typically has may not \'93operate characteristically\'94 under certain circumstances. [@foot2003n 16-17]\
\
> In this example we were considering an action in which courage was not operating as a virtue, without suggesting that in that agent it generally failed to do so. But the latter is also a possibility. If someone is both wicked and foolhardy this may be the case with courage, and it is even easier to find examples of a general connexion with evil rather than good in the case of some other virtues. Suppose, for instance, that we think of someone who is over\uc0\u8208 industrious, or too ready to refuse pleasure, and this is characteristic of him rather than something we find on one particular occasion. In this case the virtue of industry, or the virtue of temperance, has a systematic connexion with defective action rather than good action; and it might be said in either case that the virtue did not operate as a virtue in this man. Just as we might say in a certain setting \'91P is not a poison here\'92 though P is a poison and P is here, so we might say that industriousness, or temperance, is not a virtue in some. Similarly in a man habitually given to wishful thinking, who clings to false hopes, hope does not operate as a virtue and we may say that it is not a virtue in him.\
\
## Virtue theory in Stephen Brown\
\
Virtue theory is hard to characterize. What distinguishes it from deontology and utilitarianism, its major theoretical rivals? \
\
* Not "emphasis", since utilitarians and deontologists can emphasize virtues (Brown 2008, 12).\
* Rather "the difference between these three views lies in the different reasons a proponetn would provide to explain why the virtues are good to have... how the virtue are justified... how their goodness is explained" (Brown 2008, 12)\
* A virtue theory is on in which "as Statman puts it, 'the basic judgements in ethics are judgements about charcter'" or ones in which "the concept of a virtue offers th emost useful *criterion* for the rightness of an act." \
* Aristotle's virtue theory argues that a good human life is by definition the exercise of virtues, implying that virtues are not only worth having but the only goods worth having. \
* Brown's virtue theory is "moderate" in that virtues are not "theoretically fundamental" but "ethically fundamental" (15). \
\
Invoking a distinction from Roger Crisp, Brown distinguishes between virtue ethics (which prescribes advocates virtues) and virtue theory (which engages in virtue talk). \
\
Brown's rivals are not other ethical naturalisms but non-naturalists and non-cognitivists. He hopes to beat them in overall plausibility -- reading 'plausibility' as having an account that "accords with our pretheoretic ideas and intuitions about the ethical phenomena in question" (16). \

\
## Virtue theory in Foot/Hursthouse\
\
Virtues benefit their possessor\
\
##Normative Realism\
Consider first a phenomenon I shall call a Parental Directive. Parental Directives are norms delivered to virtually all young people by their guardians (parents, or older siblings, nannies, grandparents, etc.). We are introduced as children to evaluative discourse not in the abstract but in regard to concrete and particular actions, attitudes, and people. We are told, depending on the family\'92s disposition, that we ought not to yell in public, or that it is good to finish our vegetables before desert, or that if we hit our siblings we will be punished. Evaluations of behavior, especially our own behavior, come early and often. The purport of Parental Directives is objective. That is a sophisticated and academic way of saying that as children most of us knew, or learned very quickly, that if we disobeyed a Parental Directive we were really in trouble. And not just that we were in trouble with our care-givers, but that we had done wrong. Freud made much of this primordial sense of guilt. I do not propose to psychoanalyze, to praise, or to blame this sense of guilt. I merely propose to notice that it is a psychological state belying a belief, a belief (even in young children) clear and distinct. That belief is something like the conviction \'93If I break the Directive, I am in big trouble. I ought not break the Directive.\'94 What Parental Directives show us is normativity in the wild. \
\
Consider a second phenomenon I shall simply call Civic Law. A Civic Law is any law, statute, constitution, directive, rule, code, guide, command, decree that is enjoined by a governmental institution (be it monarch, senate, or township council) on its people. Despite centuries of speculation of purely hypothetical \'93a state of nature\'94 before humanity joined together into governments, as far as historical fact is concerned humans have been communal creatures for all recorded history. The Code of Hammurabi, one of our earliest archeological finds, is a code. It is a monumental exhibit of Civic Law.\
\
Consider a third phenomena I shall call Story. In stories that we tell each other, from mythology, folk tales, family anecdotes, and Hollywood films, certain patterns are universal. Characters face struggles and must overcome them. Characters (especially comic ones) exhibit flaws. \
\
Consider a fourth: Hagiography. Technically, hagiography is an art form that belongs to religious traditions. But I am treating a hagiography as a broader practice of encomium, a way of praising an exemplary person by simply telling their story and \'93getting the word out.\'94 \
\
Consider a fifth phenomenon I shall call Intelligentsia. In any society, there are \'93the wise\'94 or the intellectuals. These hold themselves and are held to higher standards of honesty, accuracy. \
\
What these phenomena highlight is that human life as live is drenched in normativity, moral and otherwise. And a full and adequate metaethical theory ought to give some account of human life as lived, as far as possible. \
\
We can see in Parental Directives and Civic Laws several of the puzzling phenomena we began with. Parental Directives show (6), and (1) and (2). Hagiography demonstrates (3) that some people are heroically virtuous and (6) the purport of objectivity. \
\
\
##David Enoch \'97 Taking Morality Seriously \
\
Another recent thinker who has advanced a thesis with some similarities is Israeli philosopher David Enoch. David Enoch's persuasive argument is that any alternative to objectivist moral realism, whatever its merits, doesn't account for or allow us to take morality sufficiently seriously -- as seriously as we already do, or as seriously as we must do \'97 especially for deliberation about what to do. Moral realism of the robust sort gains its plausibility from allowing or explaining why we take morality just so seriously -- as serious as life and death. \
\
Enoch's claim is not the same as Nagel's, but bears an important relation: Nagel claims that reasoning as if morality were objective is practically necessary, that we cannot but do so. Enoch claims that since we reason as if morality were objective (we take it very seriously) we ought to explain the fact by the best explanation, namely that morality is indeed objective. \
\
I take these claims together to be an explanandum and explanans. There are many ways of trying to convince people to take morality less seriously, by showing it up, by exposing it, deflating it, showing what moral claims "really" amount to, and so on. Peter Railton claims that some people can take morality too seriously even though they are avowed subjectivists. He says \
\
\'93Some may be drawn to, or repelled by, moral realism out of a sense that it is the view of ethics that best expresses high moral earnestness. Yet one can be serious about morality, even to a fault, without being a moral realist. Indeed, a possible objection to the sort of moral realism I will defend here is that it may not make morality serious enough\'94 (Railton, \'93Moral Realism\'94 164). \
\
An objection Enoch might make (or that I shall make in a Enochian spirit) is that there are two kinds of earnestness. One is an earnestness in doing good. The other is an inevitable earnestness in caring about what we do when we deliberate. Enoch emphasises the second. Railton\'92s non-reductive but naturalistic morality may account for the fact that people sincerely and eagerly care about doing right but it doesn\'92t account for the way we in fact deliberate. \
Enoch summarizes his moral realism in this way: \
\
>"I believe that there are irreducibly normative truths and facts, facts such that we should care about our future well-being, that we should not humiliate other people, that we should not reason and form beliefs in ways we know to be unreliable. These are, of course, just examples: even if I am wrong about them, I believe there must be some examples of this sort, examples of normative (and indeed moral) truths that are irreducibly normative, truths that are perfectly objective, universal, absolute. They are independent of us, our desires and our (or anyone else\'92s) will. And our thinking and talking about them amounts not just to an expression of any practical attitudes, but to a representation of these normative truths and facts. These normative truths are truths that, when successful in our normative inquiries, we discover rather than create or construct. They are, in other words, just as respectable as empirical or mathematical truths (at least, that is, according to scientific and mathematical realists)." \
\
##David Enoch Chapter 3 - Argument from Deliberative Indespensibility\
\
Enoch\'92s book defends moral realism against various familiar or not-so-familiar objections. His primary positive argument for moral realism (or what he calls \'93robust moral realism\'94) is, in short, that normative facts feature indispensibly in our deliberation and tha the reality of normative facts is the best explanation of that indispensability. He says, \'93 I argue that irreducibly normative truths, though not explanatorily indispensable, are nevertheless deliberatively indispensable \'96 they are, in other words, indispensable for the project of deliberating and deciding what to do \'96 and that this kind of indispensability is just as respectable as the more familiar explanatory kind. Deliberative indispensability, I argue, justifies belief in normative facts, just like the explanatory indispensability of theoretical entities like electrons justifies belief in electrons.\'94 (Enoch 2011, 50; Enoch 50)\
\
We can trace a prototypical version of this argument from deliberative indespensibility to Plato\'92s Parmenides.  In this most difficult of Platonic texts, Parmenides (the character) advances \'93the most difficult\'94 objections to realism about universals, and despite Socrates (the character)\'92s inability to respond to them, affirms realism. Why? In the absence of appropriate rebuttals of objections, why retain the belief? Because the alternative thesis is impossible to rationally maintain. \
\
\'93But on the other hand,\'94 said Parmenides, \'93if anyone, with his mind fixed on all these objections and others like them, denies the existence of ideas of things, and does not assume an idea under which each individual thing is classed, he will be quite at a loss,  since he denies that the idea of each thing is always the same, and in this way he will utterly destroy the power of carrying on discussion. You seem to have been well aware of this.\'94 \'93Quite true,\'94 he said.\'93Then what will become of philosophy? To what can you turn, if these things are unknown?\'94 (134-135c). \
\
Philosophical theories that are self-refuting or doctrines which are sets of propositions of which some contradict each other are theoretically impossible to affirm. Similarly, practical maxims that are self-refuting are impossible to act upon. Reality (formal reality) is what philosophical inquiry is about.  If philosophical inquiry is just about our shared concepts, or just about the history of falsehoods held by great dead philosophers, or just about rationality itself, then we had better use our time elsewhere. \
\
Enoch doesn\'92t think that there have been any good or good enough response to Gilbert Harman\'92s challenge that unless normative facts can feature in our best explanations. \'93The general thought seems clear enough: moral facts do not play an appropriate explanatory role (the No Explanatory Role Thesis), and, given that playing such a role is necessary for justified belief in the existence of a kind of fact (the Explanatory Requirement), we are not justified in believing in moral facts\'94  (Enoch 52). In a footnote, Enoch distinguishes his account from that of Regan: \'93An emphasis on the point of view of the deliberating agent \'96 central to my employment of the second strategy of coping with Harman\'92s Challenge \'96 can be found in Regan (2003) and Rosati (2003). At times, Regan\'92s claims are very close to my own, except he thinks such line of thought only defends realism \'93for practical purposes\'94 (2003, 656).\
\
Enoch addresses a preliminary worry or objection that something\'92s indespensibility need not signify its truth or reality. But the same (or indistinguishably similar) worry would have to be applied to electrons and numbers. Rather, he appeals to the properly basic procedure of concluding that something exists on the basis of its indispensability to certain kinds of explanation. \'93We usually take that something is theoretically useful to be reason to believe it, and perhaps we should rest content with that as a fairly basic epistemic procedure, as one place where epistemic justification comes to an end.\'94 Enoch defends the proposition that inference to the best explanation is a properly basic epistemic procedure, like relying on modus ponens or perception or memory. \
\
\
Enoch distinguishes explanatory indispensability from deliberative indispensabilty, which he explains this way:  \'93Something is instrumentally indispensable for a project, I suggest, just in case it cannot be eliminated without undermining (or at least sufficiently diminishing) whatever reason we had to engage in that project in the first place; without, in other words, thereby defeating whatever reason we had to find that project attractive\'94 (69).\
\
In short: \'93The deliberative project is, then, intrinsically indispensable (or at least \'96 it is intrinsically indispensable if the explanatory one is). If it is instrumentally indispensable for the deliberative project that p, we are justified in believing that p. At least, we are every bit as justified in so believing as we are in believing the conclusions of inferences to the best explanation (from warranted premises). If, then, it can be established that irreducibly normative truths are deliberatively indispensable, we are every bit as justified in believing in them as we are in believing in the explanation-friendliness of the universe, and, derivatively, in electrons\'94 (71).\
\
Terence Cuneo explores indispensability in this way: \
An \'93elimination stopper\'94 is something that is \'93necessary for engaging in anything we would ordinarily recognize as theorizing\'94 (Cuneo 229). \
\'93Theorizing\'97that is, accepting, evaluating, and formulating theories (however inchoate in character) of various kinds\'97is arguably an unavoidable practice for ordinary human agents; it is difficult to imagine a recognizably human way of life in which we do not engage in it. If this is right, it follows that epistemic facts are indispensable in at least this sense: They are such that participation in certain practices that are themselves practically unavoidable commits us to their existence.1\'94\
	Certain epistemic norms are just so indispensable. \
\
\
Enoch then argues that deliberation is just so indispensable. There are arbitrary choices (between this or that cereal) and there are choices where the outcome really just depends on you or your choice (how happy will I be in profession X?) But in deliberating we \'93attempt to eliminate arbitrariness by discovering (normative) reasons, and it is impossible in a believe absence of such reasons to be discovered\'94 (74). In some cases of choosing, you \'93commit yourself to there being (normative) reasons relevant to your deliberation. \
\
One review summarizes the argument in this way: \
\
(1) Moral beliefs concern something objective. (2) If Robust normative facts are indispensable for deliberation, we have some reason to believe in them, and thus to accept Robust Metanormative Realism. (3) Insofar as we have reason to accept Robust Metanormative Realism, we have reason to accept Robust Metaethical Realism. (4) Robust normative facts are indispensable for deliberation because alternatives to Robust Realism that are consistent with (1) and with normativity\'92s role in deliberation fail. (5) None of the metaphysical, epistemological, semantic or psychological objections to Robust Realism are significantly damaging. (6) Therefore, we have most reason to accept Robust Realism in both metaethics and metanormative theory. (David Faraci\'92s review, accessed online http://personal.bgsu.edu/~faracid/pubs/enoch.pdf\page \
 I argue that iexplrreducibly normative truths, though not explanatorily indispensable, are nevertheless deliberatively indispensable \'96 they are, in other words, indispensable for the project of deliberating and deciding what to do \'96 and that this kind of indispensability is just as respectable as the more familiar explanatory kind. Deliberative indispensability, I argue, justifies belief in normative facts, just like the explanatory indispensability of theoretical entities like electrons justifies belief in electrons. \
\
##David Enoch, Chapter 4 - And Now, Robust Metaethical Realism\
\
Enoch argues that moral normativity is a species of normativity, and that the distinction between normative and non-normative is much more important than the distinction between moral norm and non-moral norm. \
\
\'93With this point in mind, then, asking about the relations between the moral and the normative becomes the question of how to delineate the moral within the normative. What more, in other words, does it take for a normative truth (or falsehood) to qualify as moral? Morality is a particular instance of normativity, and so we are now in effect asking about its distinctive characteristics, the ones that serve to distinguish between the moral and the rest of the normative.\
I do not have a view on these special characteristics of the moral. In fact, I think that for most purposes this is not a line worth worrying about. The distinction within the normative between the moral and the non-moral seems to me to be shallow compared to the distinction between the normative and the non-normative \'96 both philosophically, as I am about to argue, and practically. (Once you know you have a reason to \uc0\u1092  and what this reason is, does it really matter for your deliberation whether it qualifies as a moral reason?)\'94 (Enoch 86). \
\
His argument does not depend essentially on distinguishing moral norms from non-moral norms (88). \
\
>\'93Why are people so suspicious of morality, robust-realistically understood? Sometimes the worries are metaphysical \'96 moral properties, or truths, or facts, or values, or duties, or some such are said to be metaphysically queer, not to find a comfortable place in a naturalistic worldview, and so on. The merits of such worries are a matter for Chapter 6, but my point here is much more limited: if you think that things like the purported fact that we ought not to humiliate others is metaphysically queer, you should be equally metaphysically suspicious of things like the purported fact that two-boxing is the uniquely rational policy in Newcomb\'92s Problem. If you find it hard to metaphysically stomach things like the value of humanity (or the negative value of pain), you shouldn\'92t (prima facie, at least) find the value of excitement more appetizing. If the scientific worldview can\'92t find room for the wrongness of murder, it is hard to see how it can find room for the irrationality and (sometimes) irresponsibility involved in wishful thinking. The metaphysical worries about morality seem to just be instances of metaphysical worries about normativity more generally.\'94\
\
In short, if one finds false the notion that all reality is ultimately material, is there any *other* reason to doubt moral realism? Moral disagreement is the greatest one. Moral disagreement is an especially cutting objection against virtue ethics. \
\
Enoch\'92s discussion of the (supposedly) devastating objection that moral properties or moral entities, if they existed, would be queer. He clarifies and diffuses many iterations of this objection.  Section 4.3 suggests that moral realism is \'93especially suspicious\'94 among metanormative theories because moral reasons are categorical (93). There is a difference here between realism about (say) epistemic norms and realism about moral norms which are or are supposed to relate somehow with our motivations. \
\
Enoch\'92s fourth chapter ends with a kind of challenge.  In the absences of better objections to his view or arguments in favor of rival views, he conjectures \'93that no such further consideration can be found. But my argument here is open-ended in this way, and so my conclusion can perhaps better be thought of as a challenge: if you cannot find a flaw with the arguments of the two previous chapters, but want to resist the further conclusion of Robust Metaethical Realism, you had better be able to come up with a rationale for the surprising combination of views you find yourself with\'94 (99). \
\
David Enoch Chapter 5 Doing with Less - Against naturalism)\
\'93This chapter critically discusses three families of attempts to give the metaethical or meta-normative realist pretty much all that she wants, without resorting to the metaphysical extravagance of Robust Realism. The first is an attempt at a kind of naturalism that accommodates (by reduction, with this word sufficiently broadly understood) normativity. Naturalism is rejected mostly by emphasizing the thought that normative truths and facts are just too different from natural ones to be a subset thereof.\'94\
\
Most to my purposes, in its way, is Enoch\'92s fifth chapter. He characterizes the naturalistic viewpoint by first stating a few possible theses that would qualify as naturalistic: \
\
>\'93Now, as already hinted, it\'92s not clear what the precise naturalist claim would be.2 Suggestions in this area include things like the following: normative facts just are (identical with) natural facts; normative facts are reducible to natural ones; normative facts are metaphysically grounded in natural ones; normative facts are constituted by natural facts. And further distinctions may be relevant here. For instance, we may want to distinguish \'96 even if we\'92ve settled on an identity claim \'96 between type\'96type and token\'96token identity. Furthermore, it\'92s not as if the terms just used (in any of these suggestions) are philosophically transparent. It is, after all, not at all clear, and far less is it uncontroversial, how reduction is best understood, or how grounding is to be distinguished from constitution, or \'96 perhaps most clearly \'96 how the natural is to be understood and delineated. So there are many, many suggestions that a fuller philosophical treatment would have to distinguish and evaluate piecemeal. Without pretending to cover everything in the neighborhood that needs covering, then, let me make a fairly concrete suggestion about how to capture the naturalist thought, and then argue against it. I have to concede, though, that nothing here will qualify as a conclusive argument, much less will it qualify as a conclusive argument against all possible roughly-speaking-naturalist positions here\'94 (101). \
\
\
What Enoch settles on is what he calls the nothing-over-and-above relation. In the debate, robust moral realists affirm the resolution that there are moral facts (or properties or truths etc.) over and above the natural facts; naturalists deny the resolution. \
\
>\'93When I speak of irreducibly normative (and moral) facts, I use the term \'93reduction\'94 and its relatives somewhat loosely, to pick out the nothing-over-and-above relation. According to Robust Realism, then, there are moral and other normative facts that are not merely natural ones; according to Robust Realism it is just false to say of (all) the normative facts that they are nothing over and above natural ones. The relation between the normative facts and the natural ones is not like that between statues and \'93their\'94 lumps of clay, or between chair-facts and facts about their structure and function,7 or between mental facts and physical facts (according to the monist)\'94 (102). \

# Chapter x - The objection from nature -- Radical Discontinuity\
\
The belief that 'nature is it' and 'science studies nature' has arisen from heresy to orthodoxy. \
The objection from naturalists about morality or practical reasons is that they are not 'natural.' They are not real. \
They are weird, queer, strange, sui generis, unprecedented, unexplainable, mysterious, obscure, opaque, supernatural, preternatural, and (of course) unnatural. \

#Chapter X -  Naturalizing Virtue 1 - Philippa Foot\'92s Biologism, Stephen R. Brown\'92s Darwinism \
\
	[In the last chapters, we have set out the criteria by which a robust and satisfying metaethical theory can explain what is most puzzling about our lives as practical reasoning creatures, and we sketched \'97 albeit quickly \'97 the skeleton of such a metaethical theory. That sketch invoked not only thin evaluative contrasts like \'91good/bad\'92, and \'91right/wrong\'92 but also thick ones like \'91courageous/cowardly\'92 and \'91happy/miserable.\'92 That sketch gave especial weight to the notion of human nature and tried to specify the distinctly human goods belonging to us by nature. Those goods we called person, interpersonal, and communal. They included individual flourishing of mind and will in intellectual and moral virtues, but the joys of friendship, camaraderie, and the joy of romantic love, including but not limited to reproduction, and social flourishing within family and polity or community that functions with harmony and justice. All of these, or something like them, rather than simply genetic proliferation, seem to us to be the human telos, if anything is.\

	Three sorts of responses are likely: \
	\
* \'93That all sounds about right. But much more needs to be said to clarify, disambiguate, and substantiate these claims.\
\
* \'93That doesn\'92t sound right. I have a substantive objection to one or more claims in your sketch.\'94\
\
* \'93That all sounds about right. But how do we naturalize it? How do we ensure that your sketch is consistent with naturalism per se?\'94\
Responses 1 and 2 will have to wait until later chapters. This chapter, and the next few, will be about the project of naturalizing virtue theories of which my sketch in the last chapter is a token.]\
\
## Foot \
\
### Summary of *Natural Goodness*\
\
Philippa Foot\'92s original theorizing has earned her many admirers and critics. Rosalind Hursthouse is a follower. From Wittgenstein\'92s highly idiosyncratic and penetrating chains of reasoning, Elizabeth Anscombe and Foot took inspiration to form their own style of writing and theorizing. \
\
Foot\'92s ethical naturalism is one of two or three kinds of virtue theories that are avowedly naturalistic. What exactly qualifies each as \'91naturalistic\'92 will of course be a subject of some dispute in the discussion that follows. But each of these virtue theorists lays claim to the title or banner of naturalism. So we will consider each in turn. \
\
Foot\'92s theory as expressed in Natural Goodness I take to be the following theses:\
1. The semantic meaning of evaluative terms like \'91good\'92 follows the same semantic structure as other terms \'97 this is the \'91conceptual pattern of natural normativity\'92. \
2. Norms govern each living biological organism according to its natural excellence and defect. \
3. Humans are living biological organisms.\
4. Norms govern humans according to its natural excellence and defect.\
5. Among the norms uniquely governing humans are norms of practical rationality. \
6. \
\
After explaining how natural normativity applies to humans, Foot addresses the objection related to what I have called the anomaly or "just too different" objection, that humans are saliently distinct in kind from plants and animals in that humans are rational. She does think that our rationality is sui generis among the animal kingdom. Other animals act but we *act on reasons*. We choose on rational principles (Aquinas) or act on *logos* (Aristotle). Animals, by contrast, and small children, *incline* this way rather than that. They may pursue ends but they do not pursue *ends qua ends*. A sheep sees green grass but does not *see that* the grass is green and that green food is most often healthful. Animals participate in choice as they participate in knowledge. Crows can be said to know that X will lead to Y [@crows 1][@crows2] but they do not know X *as a means* to Y. The distinction may seem arbitrary but Foot thinks (and I agree) it is important. Seeing something *qua end* is not a special mode of perception over and above visual perception nor is it something we can discern through "Lockean introspection" [@foot2003n 55]. Rather, following Wittgenstein, it has something to do with language. Humans use language to justify and explain choices. Children come to use language in this way. As she says, "When we say that human beings are able to choose *on a rational ground* as no animal can, it is because human action belongs in such surroundings, and so, ultimately, because humans use language not matched by anything in animal life." [@foot2003n 55] A formula she provides that I find helpful is this: animals pursue the *good they see* while humans pursue *what they see as good.* An animal may display hesitation when "torn between hunger and fear" or like Buridan's ass torn between two desires, but there is no behavior in the animal whose explanation demands we posit rational deliberation. \

\
This objection is closely related to another objection (presumably from a moral skeptic or immoralist) that perhaps we have no reason to do what good human beings must do. This objection concedes that 'action A is necessary for being a good human' but asks "What if I do not care about being a good human being?" [@foot2003n 52] She borrows a question from Gary Watson who wonders whether any morally realist theory can show that being a gangster is incompatible with being a good human being" [@foot2003n 53]. She wants to show that it is. \
\
###Foot and Nagel's Rationalism\
Foot's rationalism sounds a lot like Nagel's. For Nagel, we simply see some states of affairs *as* grounds for doing this and not that; we see some states of affairs as justifying acting rightly or forbidding wrongly. My child crying with hunger I see as grounds for feeding her. My son playing too roughly with my daughter I see as grounds for removing him from the room, even though his tears of protest match or equal her tears of pain. My memory that I promised to read a student's paper before Friday strikes me as grounds for staying up a little later to read it, despite feeling ready for bed. Foot says we "shouldn't be allowed to get away with a claim to 'just see' that a reason exists" [@foot2003n 58] There are different kinds of "shoulds." One "should" go to the bank to prevent an overdraft and one "should" stay home recovering from the flu.  These shoulds are relative to the circumstances. There is also a should "all things considered." This second kind of should we can say is not relative to the circumstances, or we can equally say it is relative to the fixed set of all the circumstances. In one context, the fact that a man is my father may be reason to take care of him in old age; but in another context it is not reason giving. \
\
If we have considered context and all extenuation circustances, it is possible that certain facts are reason giving full stop. If we have considered all things, we can utter an "overriding or final 'should'". For instance, suppose I'm leaning toward grading the student's paper. I think, *well, I promised to do it, and though I am sleepy, there are no extenuating circumstances that make it unwise for me to lose a little sleep. I can sleep in, or catch a nap, tomorrow, and no one's life depends on my being especially alert, and I'm not out of coffee grounds, etc.* All things considered, I ought to go ahead and grade the student's paper. \
\
Foot thinks that to not do what I *should do all things considered* is irrational. \
\
She doesn't think that morality is just a system of hypothetical imperatives, though she argued it an in earlier essay.[@foot1972morality] The truth behind her error was that desires and interests are always intimiately related with our actions and motivations. That is, desires *may* be reason giving. "A desire to see the Taj Mahal can in the right circumstances make it rational to plan a trip to India and visit a travel agent; and similarly the knowledge that cigarettes are carcinogenic can rationalize giving up smoking by showing that it is in one's interest to do so." [@foot2007n 61] But they are not *always and necessarily* the only reason giving reasons for action. \
\
And this is the mistake with which she is less patient:  the dogmatic belief that desires simply must always necessarily be the "real" reasons behind action. She bluntly asserts a plurality of fundamental motives and challenges the philosophical dogma to defend itself against those ostensive facts. She presents "all sorts of causes" that might explain an action: habits, imitation, nostalgia, ritualistic symbolism, and conscience. \
\
>What tells us that conscience cannot explain action? Someone may give as the explanation of his action a thought about right and wrong, and it may be a true explanation, as Kropotkin clearly supposed in his story of Maklay's decision not to photograph his sleeping servant. So offhand we have no reason to suppose that acting as conscience demands has to be brought into a special mould, as of a belief and a \'91conative state\'92, before we can see it as a genuine explanation of what someone does. If we like, we can say that someone whose action is explained in this way is \'91wanting to do what is right\'92; but now we are simply expressing the agent's intention in terms of wanting, not showing the explanation as fitting a favoured mould. [@foot2007n 61-62] \
\
I find this reasoning persuasive. \
\
Foot details an article from Warren Quinn to the effect that the concept of rationality includes an evaluative aspect, namely that it aims at the good. \
\
	This fits with what we have sketched in our normatively realist virtue ethical framework. Practical reason just *is* that faculty that aims at the good. \
	\
Foot summarizes: \
>Earlier in the book, in Chapters 1\'963, I gave reasons for believing propositions about natural goodness and badness in various plants, animals, and human beings; for instance, for believing that an individual oak tree with superficial, spindly roots was to be evaluated as defective, and, passing to human beings, gave reasons of the same form for the assertion that Maklay would have acted badly had he photographed his sleeping servant.\
\
What must a good person do? A person acting rationally is acting well and acting well is acting rationally. To ask for a *reason* why one should act *rationally*, that is, *on reasons at all* is in some way to be confused or absurd. Jack asks for a reason why he should act on reasons because he is confused: he thinks at the moment that 'desire' is a reason for acting because it has motivational force "built in", and that any other 'reasons' for acting must be just abstract propositions with no motivational force. Jill asks for a reason to act on reasons because she is absurd: she sincerely affirms at the same time in the same respect that one ought to phi and one ought to not-phi. Jill we cannot help with arguments, but (perhaps) with therapy. Jack we cannot help with arguments, at least, not traditional arguments. He probably needs a good deal of Socratic questioning to allow him to think through what he really thinks. \
\
\
That the phenomenon happens I do not contest, though some may. But I wonder why. \

### Responses\
\
\'93But the belief that the word \'91good\'92 must mean something different in the former and the latter is, I think, simply a prejudice coming from the type of ethical theory that has dominated analytic philosophy in the past half\uc0\u8208 century\'94 (Foot, Natural Goodness 39).[@foot2003n 39]\
\
Foot here confuses one error with another. Certainly the belief that the word 'good' is special is _part_ of the prejudice of many 20th century analytic philosophers. That may be an error. But is it "simply" that prejudice? I think not. The other error in the vicinity is the belief that reality is bifurcated at its root into the normative and non-normative, or the ethical and everything else. Normative facts, on this error are just very different from all other facts. On the one hand, modal facts seem to be more akin to normative facts than other facts, since propositions describing modal facts describe states of affairs that nowhere obtain at the moment and may never obtain. "If heated up that rock must melt." And "Necessarily, each member of the human species will one day suffer biological death." The truth of these propositions, it may be argued, depends on our empirical observation. We, or rather some scientist, has observed of this or that rock at such-and-such a temperature, and we (most all of us) have observed human beings (in pictures or in life)die of old age, sickness, injury, violence, or accidents. But have we ever *observed* the modal fact that all humans *must* die? No, we infer it as a kind of nomological principle D, abstracted from a list of examples of human death. If I listed as a-z the (relatively few) deaths we have actually observed it would be a. This fellow died; b. My grandmother died, etc. Then add them to the (perhaps thousands) of deaths I have heard about from sources I trust. We still only have a sample of a few thousand. That tiny ratio (thousands of billions of currently living humans) of a sample is supposed to justify a principle D that ranges over all possible human beings, past, present, and into the unlimited future, and even fictional characters. My point is not to challenge the inference; it seems as true and well-founded as an inductive inference can be. My point is that the proposition with a modal operator D is different from the propositions a-z without.  And D seems to me appropriately described as a *fact*. \
\
Even so, if you find moral facts bizarre, then modal facts and other normative facts are liable to seem equally bizarre, or similarly bizarre for the identical reasons. They are just too different from other facts. \
\
Another error is the thought that properly basic beliefs are not justified unless we can justify them by non-basic methods, as when some physicists deny the solidity of a brick because they know it's "not really" solid. But our account of subvenient things like atoms and molecules can and should explain our knowledge of supervenient things like solidity.  \
\
The bottom line for Foot's naturalism is that it is true but not complete. To go part of the way is not the same as to go the wrong way, but it is still not sufficient. "For to say that [human operations  ""could be evaluated in the same way as...plants"] is possible is to imply that some at least of our judgements of goodness and badness in human beings are given truth or falsity by the conditions of human life."[@foot2003n 38] And this implication is correct, she defends. Natural normativity governs plants and animals and humans in the same way. All have function and all can achieve or fail to achieve that function. A pattern of life is indexed to each species; its good is specified and the defects by contrast to those qualities conducive to its good.\
\
Each member of the species lives out a particular life in a context or environment. Even if it has species-specific "virtues" it may fail to survive or reproduce. She mentions that a swift deer as well as slow can run into the hunter's trap. \
\
Is the human good reproduction? Stephen Brown all but says yes. But the objection is that people who willfully avoid reproduction to not seem to us to be ipso facto defective. Sterile couples who wish to procreate but cannot rightly lament, for reproductive difficulties are tragic. But bachelors, celibates, homosexuals, who might but do not wish to procreate might seem to us not only normal but even exemplary in their self-control and devotion to their mission or calling. All this Foot can accommodate. She says "the teleological story goes beyond a reference to survival itself." [@foot2003v, @foot2003n ]\
\
I hesitate to play the ultimatum game and say that this is a sine qua non of human rationality. But I cannot understand those who look at all of human life, our forms of life, our elaborate way of hunting, cooking, eating, and storing our food, our elaborate way of building structures for ourselves, our scientific journals, our space program, our international trades and laws, our arts, music, poetry, dance, and theater, and all the helter-skelter that makes human civilization buzz -- I cannot understand, I say, someone who can keep all this in view and countenance the thought that "all this is just so we can survive." \
\
The reason I find it so obvious that all of human activity is for *happiness* and not merely survival is that survival is a necessary but not sufficient condition for all or most of our intentional actions. \
\
Some things have no survival value but give value to survival. We survive *for the sake*  of thriving, we don't thrive for the sake of surviving. \
\
The thought that "well, despite appearances, survival is the telos of all living things" if true, would guarantee that "all intentional human activity is for the sake of survival". But surely if the evidence suggests that we deny the consequent, then rationality demands a denial of the antecedent. If the antecedent is above rational scrutiny, if it is nonfalsifiable, then what we have is not a rational conclusion but an irrational dogma. \
\
One whose dogmatic belief in Darwinian explanations does not allow them to see the plain facts cannot claim to be more rational. They must cling to their mantra, and trust in the magical ability of propositions from neo-Darwinian theory like "survival is the only goal of biology" to help theory triumph over common sense. One small slip up and they could see the truth. \

## Stephen Brown Chapter\
\
Brown's project is to advance the cause of neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism.  His opening lines are these: \
\
>Human beings are a species of social animal for which there is a characteristic way of life. An individual human being may be evaluated as good or bad according to how wall that indvidual realizes the human way of life. I argue that there is teleology in nature; that the fact/value gap -- however we reasonably construe that idea -- is not an overriding concern; and that neo-Darwinism is no threat to the theory. (Brown 2008, 1)\
\
Brown's aim is to defend a species of ethical naturalism that is cognitivist and in which "important ethical norms and evaluations are grounded in natural facts." (2008, 2). He does not reject outright but rather brackets the supernatural. And he defines 'nature' as "what[ever] our latest and best science tells us it is" including psychology and sociology along with physics and biology. \
\
What is the explandandum for ethical naturalism? There are several. Each may need to look to its own science for an answer. \
\
* How an individual comes to have the norms he or she does: psychology, personal history. \
* How a group comes to have the norms they do: sociology, anthropology, etc. \
He admits, and seems melencholically resigned to the fact, that what we "end up with [might be] a mere description and not, alas, a justification..." (Brown 3)\
\
The metaphysical framework in which Brown wants to build ethical naturalism is this: nature is teleological. (Compare Nagel's natural teleology and ) He doesn't want to reduce ethics to biology or physics, but to explain ethics in "terms of the *rest* of nature" (Brown 5, quoting Bernard Williams). But what is the "rest of nature?" Especially if human beings are radically continuous with nature, as he avers, why do we even keep such locutions as "the rest"? He means that "the rest" of nature includes non-human stuff (rocks, stars, trees) and non-ethical human stuff (psychology, biology, culture, etc.). But wait. Does ethical naturalism have to ground normative facts in non-normative facts? No. He, along with Nagel, finds this dogmatic starting point unjustified. Rather, some normative facts are brute (for their domain at least) and ground other normative facts. These natural normative facts are natural teleological facts. "Teleology allows us to infer normative conclusions" (Brown 5). \
\
He also wants to account for our criterion [x] that ethics seems objective. He also wants to account for the sense that ethics can be or should be a science or something like a science or continuous with another recognizable science or (at the very least) not inconsistent with other recognizable sciences. \
\
### Social Utility \
As a social group, we have a common good. For Aristotle -- and Brown seems to agree -- your good, my good, and our social good are intimiately interrelated. \
\
Social and political pluralism has pros and cons. Brown hopes a naturalistic ethical theory may be of some use in negotiating the "methods of dealing with conflicts among divergent belief systems" (2008, 10). Rather than rooting putative ethical truths in contentious religious claims, we may hope to root ethical truths in a universally accessible nature. We may hope to have "freedom *of* religion as well as freedom *from* religion", enjoying whatever truths might originate from a religious tradition without relying on that religion (10). We may hope that the one thing that unites us, our common human nature, may be a source of commanility in guidance on how to live. \
\
\
### Telos and Function - General considerations\
The way we discover our common nature is by examine our *ergon* (our proper work). Brown says that this ergon is almost *function*, but not quite. He summarizes Aristotle's famous argument that *eudaimonia* is our good but seems to favor the second argument. \
\
>If we know a thing's function, then we can easily figure out what it is for the thing to function well. A thing's functinong well is its best good. Thus, if we know what the function of a human being *qua* human being is, then we can figure out what it is for a human being to function well, and this well functioning of a human being is the best good for that sort of being. (Brown 23)\
\
The function of a thing, in Aristotle, is the work it performs that is not also the function of other things. Each thing like 'hammer' has a differentia from all non-hammers -- namely, pounding or hammering. And each type of hammer has a differentia from other hammers: framing, finishing hammer, mallot, sledge, etc., all pound but pound different objects or do so differently. But human beings live and grow and metabolize like plants; we sense perceive like horses, oxen, and other animals; our ergon 'expresses' or 'requires'  *reason* (or as Foot would have it, speech). Our function is to reason; our good is reasoning well. \
\
How reasoning well relates wth virtue is a bit trickier. Are virtues simply (by definition) the reasonable activities? If so, then the connection between reason and virtue remains tight. But if not, they need to be connected. \
\
I was illuminated by Brown's discussion of three related concepts:\
\
* the human good\
* the good human being\
* good for a human being\
\
Here is one way of putting it: If virtue is the human good, then a good human is virtuous, and virtues are (as we say of spinach and broccoli) "good for us." By "virtue is the human good" we seem to mean our good qua species. By "good for us" we mean something more specific to individual members of the species. Something related to the human good is good for us in that it feels good, actualizes our potential, fulfills us, perfects us, or something like that. \
\
\
### The function of artifacts and natural kinds\
What is the function of a horse? Brown's discussion effectively explores all the options here. Unlike a knife or other artificial object, the function of a horse would not be defined by human artifice. Nor is a horse's function or ergon obviously some work relating to human use (riding, pulling, etc.). It is implausible to suppose that a species is indexed to another species, that a the species is incomplete without being used by humans; furthermore, the individual jobs horses do might be more effectively done by other species (oxen, etc.). But horses have been in some part bred by humans for human purposes (riding, showing, fighting, hunting). So it might be that the *current* breeds of domesticated horses *are in fact* more like knives than wild dogs. Even so, what about other non-domesticated horses? Either they have no ergon at all, or their ergon is something unrelated to human artifice. \
\
Take the first option: horses have no ergon, no function, no discernable final cause, no unique activity they do that nothing else in nature does. Does this option mean we are giving up on "natural teleology" for biology? Plato and Aristotle both speak as if all of nature was teleological. So it would mean giving up on the platonic or Aristotelian version of teleology, for whatever that is worth. But Plato's teleology in the *Timaeus* is admittedly mythical and speculative, while Aristotle explores non-teleological explanations of natural phenomena in his *Physics*, the he says that "Nature does nothing absurdly or to no purpose" (*De Caelo* 291b14). So we haven't quite given up on Aristotle yet. Rather, we need to hear how, if at all, he articulates the natural teleology of individual biological species. \
\
### An argument by analogy?\
Brown highlights that Aristotle's argument by analogy amounts to a rhetorical question with which he is trying to "badger" us.  Aristotle's human craftsmen have jobs or functions -- the carpenter works with wood, the horse trainer trains horses, and so on -- so are we to say that humans have no function?\
\
* Humans A, B, C, etc. (qua roles we play, mothers, fathers, craftsmen, etc) all have functions. (via observation)\
* Therefore humanity (qua species) have functions. (via inductive generalization)\
\
* Humans (qua members of the species) are like craftsmen.\
* All craftsmen have functions. (via observation)\
* Therefore humans (qua species) have functions. (via analogy to first premise)\
\
But in what way are humans "like" craftsmen? Aristotle's argument crucially depends on whether one accepts the fundamental comparison between humans qua biological creatures and the roles humans play. \
\
\
### Contemporary methods\
Brown's suggestion is to apply more familiar methods for finding function. Suppose we find a mysterious artefact in an archeological dig. How would we discover its function? We would compare it to similar known objects of the same time and place, if possible. If there are no similar objects, then we might use the object for various purposes to ascertain what it does (not just what it does *uniquely well*). Of course, multiple objects do the same thing: Brown mentions that phones and email both communicate across long distances. \
\
His example doesn't tell. The "primitive human stumbling across various items" does not have time to familiarize herself with the telephone and email. He does not mention that, given time and/or instruction, the primitive human would discover what we industrialized moderns already know: that email is most often best for asynchronic communication, and phone most often best for synchronic communication. \
\
Regardless, Brown suggests that the biologist looking at organs "faces similar problems"  (Brown 2008, 30). She can compare the functions of similar organisms; if no similar organs are forthcoming, she can see what it *does*. And she can "look at the organ from an evolutionary standpoint" -- that is, "see what effects the existence of the organ has on the survival and reproduction of the organism" (Brown 2008, 30). This last does not invalidate the Platonic/Aristotelian method of looking for what the organism does best, but supplements it. \
\
### The human function\
So what about human beings qua species? Forget my individual telos for a moment. When we examine the function of any old item of human life, say, a knife, we see that it cuts. \
>What is the purpose of cutting vegetables? To prepare them for cooking. Why prepare vegetables for cooking? So we can eat them. What is the purpose of eating? so we can go on living. The series could stop there, but one could continue on and ask what the purpose in living is. In that we confront an existential question. (Brown 31-32)\
He briefly considers just ending the series by repeating the last answer: we eat in order to keep living, and we live in order to keep living -- the end. He also considers that the question loses its species-indexed meaning at this point and becomes member-indexed -- what is *my* purpose. \

##Smith's Moral Problem\
The moral problem is the conjunction of three truths that all seem true but also cannot all be true. \
\
1. Moral norms are objective; moral judgments are true (mind-guiding).\
2. Moral norms are practical; moral judgments are good (action-guiding).  \
3. A belief cannot motivate and a motivation cannot believe (Hume's psychology). \
\
Smith's solution is an 'ideal-agent' solution. Whatever I would desire if I were fully rational is the moral thing to do. The problem [as we have seen] is that such hypothetical statements about the hypothetical peron's hypothetical desires justify complete skepticism. We just don't, and can't, know what a rational person would desire unless we are rational.\

##McDowell's critique of empirical ethics in bald naturalism\
The critique we find in McDowell is the "just too different" point. Bald naturalism, as a realm of unbroken and perhaps unbreakable law, is just too different from the space of reasons. \
\
McDowell agrees about Foot's rejection of supernaturalism and of naturalistic subjectivism. [@mcdowell.mvr]\

#Chapter X -  Some Metaphysics of Ethics - "Naturalism?"\
\
The primary thesis I am defending is that norms are real features of reality on par with and radically continuous with other real things, be they abstract (natural laws) or concrete objects of various kinds (trees, stars, and mollusks). Knowledge of these norms may be difficult or may be easy. Some cases I have offered for consideration are exceedingly easy for normal rational agents. These I have called 'primary norms.' Primary norms include norms like *it is good to be rational* and *love one another* and *life is good*.  \
\
The question of 'naturalism' I have tried to show is hopelessly vague. The question of 'naturalism' is not, however, meaningless. Teasing out the concerns of naturalists and non-naturalists we discover three clear questions: \
\
1. Is all that is real physical/material? \
2. Is all that is real real? \
3. Is all that is real divine? \
\
The second question is just the tautology 'what is real is real' phrased as a question. As such, the answer is Yes. \
\
1. Is all that is real physical/material? \
2. Is all that is real real? \
3. Is all that is real divine? \
\
My answers to these shall be: \
\
1. Is all that is real physical/material? No. \
2. Is all that is real real? Yes. \
3. Is all that is real divine? Not necessarily. \
\
\
## 1. Is all that is real physical/material? Physicalism? \
\
But the question of the reality of x has become for us embroiled in the question of the *physicality* of x. \
\
The question "is x real?" has often become for many analytic philosophers "is x natural?". I concede to the equivalence. The question "is x natural?" has become for many "is x physical/material?" Since physics as a discipline is undergoing such an overhaul, questions about whether x is physical should be deferred to a distant and uncertain future. But we know what matter is by ostensive definition: "the stuff my computer is made of." I shall take matter, not physical stuff, to be the more basic notion, and even the more scientific and respectable notion.  \
\
The equivalence between reality and nature and between nature (phusis) and matter is, for those who are puzzled by such metaethical questions, the source of the puzzlement. \
\
In regards to the above list of explananda, we listed some diversities that seem different. \
\
The problem of the one and the many, as it pertains to metaethics, is this: what if anything unifies all the varieties of value we both *recognize* and *live by*?  \
\
This is what I mean by saying that we are looking for *radical continuity*: what root unifies or might unify these diversities? They are unified in our language and in our thought. Are they really unified in themselves?\
\
There seems to be one kind of goodness distributed across many different but ultimately related kinds. The good of intellect and the good of will are unified, for us humans, in goodness. But the good of beauty, excellence, moral virtue, order, and being itself are not obviously or easily reducible to human goods of intellect and will. I argue that they are not easily reducible because they are not in fact reducible at all. \
\
For the physicalist, there is no option but to so reduce them. What unifies human goods is just that they contribute to human welfare. Human welfare we must read as a particular configuration of matter (perhaps my and everyone else's brain states being thus-and-so). What unifies all non-human goods is humanity: that is, what all putatively "non-human goods" have in common is that evaluations of them appear in human discourse. \
\
This is all very misguided. But the problem is the means. The end is correct, however misguided the means. The goal of unification is one we deeply desire and preverbially yearn for. We all want a  satisfying account, a way to understand the whole world a global and radical continuity. We all want to understand the world and our place in it, if there is such a place to be understood. \
\
The way back on track, then, is to suspend belief in physicalism for now, to suspend the way we use the terms 'nature' and 'science,' and stick to a discussion of normativity in light of a broad and plausible metaphysical framework. \
\
That framework is a faith in the fundamental proposition that reality is intelligible and hence some (though not all) of our theorizing about reality stops no shorter than reality itself. \
\
I find it telling that some critiques of my thesis have not said "You are wrong" but "there is no possible answer to your questions because reality is unknowable". The person who tells me I am wrong still believes in truth. The person who tells me reality is unknowable has given up on the inquiry. They are not part of my conversation. If they are right, then by their own lights, my theory of reality is just as fantastic as theirs. They ought not go around criticizing other people's fantasies on the basis of their own fantasy. But if, as I think, a bad theory is not fantasy but falsehood, then a good theory is not pleasing fantasy but truth, they ought to correct both themselves and me. \
\
That is, the moral nihilist predicates her moral theory on metaphysical nihilism or skepticism. I predicate my metaphysical realism on moral realism. Since I know it to be good to help starving children, to train my natural children, to be faithful to my friends, to be gentle and kind to my wife, therefore I know knowledge of reality is possible. There are many moral truths, lamentably many, important ones, that I know I am ignorant of. But not these. These are non-negotiable. Openness with respect to the badness of cruelty is a base, dangerous, and noxious openness. Openness with respect to these true ethical judgments would be just as bad as being closed with respect to negotiable ethical judgments like that felons should not vote or that divorce should be illegal. The question is not "is it good to be open-minded or close-minded?" but "about what should one be close-minded? what open-minded?"\
\
\
\
## Aristotelian Nature Telos Chapter \
Discussions of putatively "Aristotelian" or neo-Aristotelian elynchthics self-consciously import some Aristotelian metaphysics. But how much? The linchpin is Aristotle's notion of telos.\
\
Aristotle's metaphysics can be characterized around a few broad themes: \
1. Form and matter;\
2. Actuality and potentiality;\
3. Causation: final, formal, efficient, and material; \
4. Substance and nine types of property; \
\
Of course, his epistemology cottons on to his metaphysics. To know X is to actualize the mind with respect to the form of X; to know X is to be informed by X. Knowledge is the telos of intellect or %\uc0\u957 \u959 \u965 \u962 . The intellect that is being actualized by the actualities/forms of objects in the world is itself an object of the world. The intellect being actualized is fulfilling its nature (its form). Fulfilling a nature means realizing a telos inherent or coordinate with the form. \
\
### Telos\
\
Some philosophers talk of telos as if it were a separable portion of Aristotle's unified metaphysics. I am not so sure.  [^5]\
\
[^5]: I am thinking of people like Canadian metaphysician Kathrin Koslicki who said during the Q&A of a talk that telos had been "surgically removed" from her hylomorphic metaphysics. "A Hylomorphic Analysis of Concrete Particular Objects" But surgical removal of an essential organ kills the patient. \
\
Metaphysically, the reason telos is the linchpin is that without telos, formal structure does not exhaustively account for an organism. A very old book on biology argues that biologists are often split between form based and function based biologies, between anatomy or physiology [@russell1916]. For Aristotle, such debates are needless. Formal cause and final cause together (with material and efficient of course) constitute an organism's true identity. \
\
Epistemically, knowing the form of x without knowing the telos of x is a good start but only part of the way to knowledge of x. \
\
####MacIntyre \
\
MacIntyre's *After Virtue* tells a story. Our predecessors had an understanding of the virtues that allowed them to individually and collectively pursue the human good together. We moderns have fragmented virtue and now we are trying to put it back together again. But the problem is not just that we moderns lack virtue; we lack an understanding of virtue combined with a partial understanding of several incomplete fragments of virtue. \
\
The solution is, first, to get perspective on the problem behind the problem.  The \'93problem behind the problem\'94 is the Enlightenment abandonment of telos for individual human persons and whole human communities or political units all directed towards one shared human good, the personal and political virtues being in this frame the means to that telos. The solution to that is the personal and political restoration of a shared conception of a good \'97 better yet, a shared recognition of the real good \'97 and a realignment with the broadly Aristotelian tradition in cultivating the virtues that are by definition means to that telos. \
\
\
MacIntyre is clear that the loss of telos in our worldview is the loss of truth. So why would an ethical framework appeal to Aristotelianism without telos? I can't see any good reason. One reason that is not a *good* reason is that we have been bullied to reject certain scientific truths by a dogmatic philosophical minority. Is it too bold to respond to such bullying by... just saying no? I revisit this question below. \
\
\
#### R. Scott Smith\
How naturalistic is this virtue ethic? [I have argued that we cannot simply adopt the title for social reasons if we deny the majority view of what nature is.] How Aristotelian is neo-Aristotelianism? We ought not expect that every jot and tittle of Aristotle be preserved as sacred, but we ought to expect that some of Aristotle\'92s own core commitments overlap with a neo-Aristotelian\'92s core commitment. \
\
R. Scott Smith argues that MacIntyre\'92s virtue ethics assumes realism (Smith, Virtue Ethics and Moral Knowledge). Without the assumption, it loses coherence.\

#### Telos in Nagel\
*Mind and Cosmos* argues persuasively that the concept of nature wherein teleology and teleological laws are surgically removed is false. The excise of teleology is no part of the definition of natural science. Amateurs studying the history of natural science and the reflective practictioners within it bear this out. \

\
#### Telos and Final Cause\
1. Is our final cause survival and reproduction?\
* It seems that it is for survival and reproduction are the final cause of all living things, all organisms on the tree of life.\
* Furthermore the drive for survival, Metabolsis, and reproduction are the only processes that all living things have in common. They are the proper act, the distinctive work, the unique function of living things.\
* The drive for life in humans is stronger then other competing drives, including whatever conscience or moral norms dictate, since most people will do what is dishonorable or wrong to preserve their own lives, or the lives of their genetic kin. \
 * The drive for reproduction, the sex drive, is stronger than even our drive for eating or drinking or other forms of pleasure. Psychologists tell us that males think about sex every eight minutes, or so. Also people will have sex at almost any opportunity. The Olympic Village being an example. Also, people reproduce far beyond the rate that other considerations recommend. The species is rapidly over populating the planet at the expense of other ecosystems, other species, other lifeforms like the rain forest, and even the planets as a whole.\
* On the contrary, Socrates tells the Athenians at his trial to cultivate virtue which is the health of the soul more than the adornment and pleasure of the body. And many other moral exemplars, Saints, and sages tell us that the final cause of humanity as a species are something more then our biological dictates.\
* I answer that our end as the perfection of our nature. In so far as our nature includes but is not limited to our biology, our end includes but is not limited to our biology. Furthermore, occasionally the pursuit of our final cause demands that we ignore or reject or deny the dictates of our biology. As for instance, a parent who is down to her last loaf of bread will suffer hunger herself in order to feed her children. Or a celibate monk who will forgo the pleasures of sex, the biological interest in reproduction, and the joy of child rearing for the sake of the perfection of intellect and heart. \
\
* Plus, Saints just do not talk like that. They talk about serving God, or becoming enlightened, or beholding the truth, or spreading happiness to all. Notice that spreading happiness to all May or may not correspond to maximizing my own personal happiness.\
* Talk about such final causes has seem more likely to be included in the definition of perfecting human nature according to its form is in ennobling. \
* By contrast talk about final causes such as survival and reproduction is morally enervating. People who think and talk like this display also pathological psychologies obsessed with what is merely animal and ignoring or denying or rejecting what is more than animal. \
\
The clearest and best definition of virtue I have ever heard is still the simplest. The first definition I heard it's still the clearest invest.\
\
The virtue of X is a property of X that makes it F well, where F is its proper function, it's proper work, or achieving its final cause, attaining to its telos, actualizing the potential inherent to its form. A virtue of a knife is that property of a knife that makes it cut well. Knives are supposed to cut, that is what they are for, cutting and occasionally stabbing are its final causes, it's proper function. And so the virtues of knives is at least: being sharp, being durable enough and hard enough to cut through matter softer than itself, and depending on the knife a serrated edge or a sharp point. There are a variety of species of knife, who's functions display a variety of species of cutting and or stabbing. The purpose or final cause of a knife is also relative to the user of the knife. Since we are speaking about implements for humans, a virtue of the knife may include such necessary properties as having one and that is emphatically not sharp so that the user can hold that end without being cut.\
\
Now if all this qualification is necessary for something so simple an artifact as a knife, it will take much more work to sketch even a plausible prima Facie Account of the final cause of simple natural objects, let alone complex organisms.  Doing that work is our task.\
\
What does Aristotle say is the telos of, say, an oak tree? The answer must be discovered at least in part empirically. Some induction or abstraction helps us to identify the form behind the phenomena we observe. Oaktree's tend to become fully grown folks. At some point the maturation process slows and stops. What do fully grown oaks do? What is their proper work? They provide oxygen into the atmosphere. They provide housing for birds, bugs, and shade and housing for primates and humans. They preserve the soil. They grow and reproduce. What properties might qualify as the virtues of an oak?  Certainly needs sunshine water atmosphere and soil of a certain kind to thrive Qua Oaktree.  But these are not its virtues, these are necessary conditions for the rising of its virtues. Contributing factors we might call them. Sources of life. It's virtues would be strength of limb, deep roots, strong cellulose walls, a sufficiently wide trunk, etc.\
\
What is the final cause of a human? What is our proper work? It is not a tautology to say that what we are supposed to do is to be men and women. For we can fail at that. Once we have human nature, we cannot fail to be human in some descriptive sense. But even though we have human nature, we can fail to be happy, to achieve humanity in a prescriptive cents.\
\
We are supposed to thrive, flesh, be happy. We are supposed to be Saints. That means wise thinkers and heroically virtuous doers.\

#Chapter X Naturalizing Virtue 2 - John McDowell\'92s View from Somewhere, and Intersubjective Norms of Reason and Practical Reason\
\
##Introduction\
\
Richard Bernstein calls John McDowell\'92s naturalism a much needed \'93novel twist\'94 on the stalemate between those who think naturalism will eventually make good on its promise to naturalize reason and those who are sick of waiting and ready to give up. \
\
He quotes Joseph Margolis and Mark Gottlieb as saying that: \
\
Naturalism in the current analytic sense may well be the dominant programmatic orientation of Anglo-American philosophy. It may be characterized as an informally linked family of doctrines and strategies broadly in accord with 'ancestral' themes of W. V. O. Quine's "Epistemology Naturalized." The original themes feature in Quine include: a preference for physicalism of one sort or another, a strong emphasis on the continuity of science and philosophy, particularly at the explanatory level, and the effective replacement of legitimative inquiries of a typically noncausal sort by causal inquiries centering on belief." (Berstein 58) \
\
The "specter of Kant keeps surfacing in thinkers like Putnam and Habermas who are convinced that reason cannot be naturalized" (Berstein 59). The "novel twist" comes from John McDowell. Berstein says that \'93at first glance, it seems that McDowell fits right into the tradition of Kantian anti-naturalism \'97 a tradition that runs from Kant right up to Putnam and Habermas\'94 since he thinks \'93reason can\'92t be naturalized\'94 (Bernstein 62). But his arguments, Berstein thinks, against bald naturalism amount to some sophisticated question-begging via sleight of hand. Even so, when we look at particular \'93first order claims\
\
\
##John McDowell\
\
###Mind and World\
The \'93oscillation\'94 between two false and fearful alternatives is the backdrop against which McDowell\'92s unique beliefs about mind and world come to light. \
\
\
John McDowell shares with Thomas Nagel a radical lack of curiosity about the metaphysics \'97 that is, the traditional metaphysics \'97 of morality. As a type of Kantian, he doesn\'92t think such answers are possible to find and so such questions not much worth asking. \
Second nature is the key concept for John McDowell. Second nature is that realm of human intersubjectivity wherein we are sensitive to reasons (that is, reasons for thinking and reasons for acting). Bald nature is not sensitive to reasons. Supernature, hypothetically, would be but is not natural and so is spooky. \
\
\
##Rosalind Hursthouse\
\
Rosalind Hursthouse has become, in recent years, the premier voice of virtue ethics. Dialoguing fluently not only with Aristotle but Plato and Kant, Hursthouse has synthesized much of John McDowell and Philippa Foot into her own original, articulate vision of a respectable modern virtue ethics. \
\
###Naturalism\
Hursthouse\'92s account consists of a few interrelated and important theses: virtues benefit their possessor (Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics, Chapter 8). In the case of human virtue, the virtues are \'93those traits that human beings need to live well as human beings, to live a characteristically human life\'94 (Hursthouse 192).  \
\
But what is this characteristically human life? What is a human? \
\
In guiding action, virtue ethics appeals to the virtuous agent.\
\
P.1. An action is right iff it is what a virtuous agent would characteristically (i.e. acting in character) do in the circumstances.\
An objection is that P.1. suffers with respect to rival theories in failing to be action guiding or informative. But Hursthouse\'92s reply (which smacks of a tu quoque until we realize that ethical inquiry is hard for everyone) is that utilitarianism and deontology suffer in virtually the same respect. To make this clear, she rephrases the first premise. \
P.1. An action is right iff it is what an X agent would characteristically do in the circumstances.\
To this, she adds: \
P.1a. An X agent is one who has and exercises certain character traits, namely the Xs.\
\
\
  \'93The other first premises, taken strictly, are equally uninformative. We overlook this point because the utilitarian specifications of best consequences are so familiar, and all the deontologists we know cite familiar moral rules. But, for all that is said in the first premise of either, strange things might emerge in the second\'94 (30). \
\
Hare would have it that 'good' was somehow functioning differently in ethical utterances than in phrases like 'the 2003 models have good enginges.' Hursthouse explains Foot's observation about attributive adjectives in this way: \
>You can evaluate and choose things according to almost any criteria you like, you must select the noun or noun phrase you use to describe the thing you are calling good *advisedly*, for it determines the criteria of goodness that are appropriate. Hare can call a cactus a good one on the grounds that it is diseased and dying, and choose it for that reason, but what he must not do is describe it as a good *cactus*, for a cactus is a living thing. He can describe it as a good \'91decorative object for my windowsill\'92 or \'91present to give my detestable mother\uc0\u8208 in\u8208 law\'92, but not as a good cactus. And it was part and parcel of what used to be thought of as Foot's \'91naturalism\'92 in ethics that, following Anscombe in \'91Modern Moral Philosophy\'92, she denied that this grammatical feature of the word \'91good\'92 and its related terms suddenly underwent a mysterious change when we started doing ethics. What goes for \'91good cactus\'92, \'91good knife\'92, \'91good rider\'92, also goes for \'91good human being\'92 even when we use that phrase in ethics (195). \
\
\
### Hursthouse on Naturalism?\
\'93Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism\'97broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on considerations of human nature, on what is involved in being good qua human being\'94 (Hursthouse 193). But the question is whether \'93human nature\'94 is purely descriptive set of properties, ranges, relations, etc., or includes normative content from the outset.  As Hursthouse summarizes the worry: \'93Ethical naturalism hopes to validate beliefs about which character traits are virtues by appeal to human nature, and this may seem a vain hope. For either we speak from the neutral point of view, using a scientific account of human nature\'97in which case we won't get very far\'97or we speak from within an acquired ethical outlook\'97in which case we will not validate our ethical beliefs, but merely re\uc0\u8208 express them\'94 (Hursthouse 193). \
\
Her path through the horns of this dilemma is the one blazed by John McDowell. Ethical inquiry is neither scientific in the sense that we must start with a neutral 3rd-personal point of view to attain \'93objectivity\'94 nor is it foundational in that we must start \'93from within\'94 the 1st-personal point of view, using a core proposition or set of propositions whose truth is certain and unproblematic and working out from there. Rater, within an ethical outlook we modify our ethical outlook. It is the ship of Neurath. \
\
\'93This chapter aims [give] some fairly specific details of how, in naturalistic terms, I might set about finding the rational credentials for my beliefs about which character traits are the virtues\'94 (Hursthouse 194). \
\
\
How naturalistic is this virtue ethic? [I have argued that we cannot simply adopt the title for social reasons if we deny the majority view of what nature is.] How Aristotelian is neo-Aristotelianism? We ought not expect that every jot and tittle of Aristotle be preserved as sacred, but we ought to expect that some of Aristotle\'92s own core commitments overlap with a neo-Aristotelian\'92s core commitment. \
\
R. Scott Smith argues that MacIntyre\'92s virtue ethics assumes realism (Smith, Virtue Ethics and Moral Knowledge). Without the assumption, it loses coherence. \

###Stubborn Rationalism in Thomas Nagel\
\
Thomas Nagel is one of those frustrating thinkers who allude to and interact with many but cite or name only a few.  \
\
One of our governing questions in this dialectic has been: how do we know good from bad, right from wrong, desirable from undesirable when we in fact know it? This question assumes quite plausibly that we know the good at least some times and in some ways.  What does it mean to be good or right or desirable and how did we come to knowledge that X was such?\
Thomas Nagel\'92s view is that morality is objective, that moral values are really real, that moral knowledge is possible, that there are moral truths, etc. and etc. For Nagel, \'93objective\'94 means that reducing all values to merely subjective (in various senses of the term) is impossible, both theoretically and practically. The alternative then, is some kind of objectivity. He says, \'93The problem of the place of value in the natural world... has to do specifically with the practical domain \'97 the control and assessment of conduct.\'94 When the dust settles on long and complicated abstract discussions of the foundations of value, we still have to do something with our lives. And we cannot psychologically nor logically assert consistently that our choices of what to do are based on no reason. \
\
\
There are two senses of \'93objective\'94 that can be opposed to Nagel\'92s sense of \'93subjective.\'94 The thinner sense is that we can\'92t help but treat it as objective, whether it is or not \'97 this sense remains agnostic. The thicker sense is that we can\'92t help but treat some value as objective and the reason we psychologically or logically cannot do so is because it is really objective. This sense of objective is, by Nagel\'92s own argument, a hypothesis to explain a psychological or logical  impossibility, but it is a very good hypothesis. \
\
\
Nagel\'92s position here is that normative judgments are truth apt. He says, \'93Normative realism is the view that propositions about what gives us reasons for action can be true or false independently of how things appear to us, and that we can hope to discover the truth by transcending the appearances and subjecting them to critical assessment\'94 (View from Nowhere 139). However, he is quick to distinguish this answer from various answers to Question 3 \'97 what makes evaluative propositions true. He assures us, \'93it is not a form of Platonism. The claim is that there are reasons for action, that we have to discover them instead of deriving them from our pre-existing motives\'97 and that in this way we can acquire new motives superior to the old\'94 (139). So his answer to Question to is a staunch yes, but he wants to distinguish that affirmative from various ways of spelling out exactly how to explain truth aptitude. He says, \'93perhaps a richer metaphysic of morals could be devised, but I don\'92t know what it would be\'94 (139). \
\
\
His stance here may seem simply stubborn. But it is not. He treats objective values \'97 like the freedom of the sort relevant for moral accountability and self-responsibility \'97 as a \'93defeasible presumption\'94 (VFN 143). The burden of proof is on those who wish to argue that there are no objective values and no objectively true value judgments, or that putatively true value judgments like \'93we ought to treat others as equal to ourselves\'94 are not even truth apt. Like the reality of some item of the external world, the reality of an objective value can be defeated in individual cases, as when a long-cherished value judgment is exposed as a mere prejudice or instance of groupthink. But when I learn that a mirage is not real or a prejudice is false, I rightly conclude that some appearances are deceiving and that some products of groupthink are false. I do not \'97 and should not \'97 jump to the conclusion that all is appearance or all is prejudice. Just because some X are Y does not entail that all X are Y. We can only totalize a local exposoure of non-objectivity into global subjectivism if we make that invalid inference or hasten to hypothesis that unlikely explanation. \
\
Now, the explanation is more likely on the assumption that \'93if values are real, they must be real objects of some other kind\'94 (VFN 144). As the external world realist, so long as the moral realist can defend the mere possibility of objective value, the presumption of objective value remains the default position (VFN 143-144). He says, \'93If I have a severe headache, the headache seems to me to be not merely unpleasant, but a bad thing. Not only do I dislike it, but I think I have a reason to try to get rid of it. It is barely conceivable that this might be an illusion\'94 (VFN 145). Such glaring truths of daily experience may be puzzling against a background of physicalism, but it is not thereby to be abandoned. \
\
\
Thomas Nagel may be considered radically uncurious about the metaphysical question. He is right, I think, to say that metaethical questions often confuse the normative questions \'97 or rather that only by retaining focus on the primary normative questions can we keep perspective on metaethics. \

#Chapter x - Ethical Naturalism as Nihilism, of both reality and morals, as a cliff\
\
Even though Kant was a nihilist about metaphysics, he was a realist about morality. \
\page \
##Terence Cuneo - The Normative Web\
\
Terrence Cuneo\'92s fascinating book builds an argument for moral realism on the key premise that \'93if moral facts do not exist, then epistemic facts do not exist\'94 (The Normative Web 90). This premise leads us, if we affirm the antecedent, to the \'93undesirable results\'94 of having to affirm that epistemic facts do not exist. Once we affirm that epistemic facts do not exist, it follows that we do not believe anything, let alone that view, on the basis of epistemic facts. \
\
Moral facts are thought objectionable by some for their \'91queer\'92 features, such as (in the words of Lenman\'92s review of Cuneo): \
(a) the supervenience of moral facts on other, prosaically descriptive, facts\
(b) the intrinsically motivating character of moral reasons\
(c) the inescapable or categorical character of moral reasons\
(d) the supposed mysterious nature of moral facts in failing to fit neatly into a naturalistic picture of the world\
(e) the failure of moral facts to play a role in explaining other facts -- or a sufficiently rich range of such facts\
(f) the great extent and apparent intractability of moral disagreement.\
\
David Enoch agrees. \
\
\'93Why are people so suspicious of morality, robust-realistically understood? Sometimes the worries are metaphysical \'96 moral properties, or truths, or facts, or values, or duties, or some such are said to be metaphysically queer, not to find a comfortable place in a naturalistic worldview, and so on. The merits of such worries are a matter for Chapter 6, but my point here is much more limited: if you think that things like the purported fact that we ought not to humiliate others is metaphysically queer, you should be equally metaphysically suspicious of things like the purported fact that two-boxing is the uniquely rational policy in Newcomb\'92s Problem. If you find it hard to metaphysically stomach things like the value of humanity (or the negative value of pain), you shouldn\'92t (prima facie, at least) find the value of excitement more appetizing. If the scientific worldview can\'92t find room for the wrongness of murder, it is hard to see how it can find room for the irrationality and (sometimes) irresponsibility involved in wishful thinking. The metaphysical worries about morality seem to just be instances of metaphysical worries about normativity more generally.\
\
More or less relatedly, some suspicions about morality (robust-realistically understood) are epistemological in nature. If there are truths of the kind that the Platonist (say) envisages, how is it, it is sometimes asked, that we can have epistemic access to them? And if we can\'92t, should we conclude that on this view none of our moral beliefs are justified? And isn\'92t this a reductio of this kind of Platonism? Again, a discussion of the merits of this and related objections will be postponed, this time until Chapter 7. But for now the crucial thing to see is that the epistemological challenge \'96 whatever exactly its details \'96 seems to apply just as forcefully to other, non-moral normative truths and facts. So here too, the objection to Robust Metaethical Realism is just a particular instance of an objection to a similar view about the normative as a whole.\'94 (89)\
\
Cuneo\'92s \'93Interlude on Naturalism\'94 interests me greatly (101-4). \
\
>To this point I've traversed some fairly familiar territory in contemporary metaethics\'97four variants of Mackie's celebrated \'91argument from queerness\'92.20 I want now to interrupt the flow of the discussion for a moment to make a general comment about what is going on in these antirealist arguments and to draw out a further implication of my argument.\
>The four lines of argument we've considered hinge on the claim that, were moral facts to exist, they would be objectionably \'91mysterious\'92 and, hence, we have excellent reason to believe they do not exist. While it is fairly commonplace to hear philosophers say such things, it is not always so obvious what is meant when they do so. Imagine an outsider listening in on this discussion between moral realists and antirealists\'97one who, say, is used to wondering about whether there are four\uc0\u8208 dimensional space\u8208 time worms, (p.102) closed space\u8208 times, event\u8208 horizons, or universals. She might find herself deeply puzzled by the discussion thus far. What, after all, renders moral facts more objectionably mysterious than these other kinds of putative entities? And why should this oddness count against the existence of moral facts?\
>I take the answer to be that the antirealist thinks that moral facts are mysterious in two ways. They are mysterious, first, in the sense of being anomalous; moral facts don't fit into our best picture of what the world is like. Moral facts are mysterious, second, in the sense that they are impenetrable. We have no illuminating account of their nature or behavior. Of these two senses of mystery, I judge that it is the first that is doing the most work in the antirealist's arguments.21 So, let's focus on it for a moment.\
>That nothing is brutely anomalous I take to be a truism. Entities are always anomalous relative to some set of assumptions or background picture of what the world is like. And it is no secret that the background picture against which moral facts are supposed to be anomalous in the arguments we've considered thus far is a naturalist picture of the world.22 Almost without fail, antirealists object to moral facts because they appear to fit so poorly into the world picture science is supposed to give us. Simon Blackburn puts the point particularly vividly in his essay \'91How to Be an Ethical Anti\uc0\u8208 Realist\'92, when he writes that moral antirealism is \'91demanded\'92 by a naturalistic worldview and claims that, according to moral antirealists, \'91moral properties . . . are not in this world at all, and it is only because of this that naturalism remains true\'92.23 If Blackburn is right, a necessary condition of naturalism's being true is moral realism's being false. Now my own conviction is that this is not the sort of thing a naturalist ought to say. According to a popular and broadly Quinean understanding of naturalism, the naturalist's creed is that we ought to follow science wherever it goes. (p.103) Arguably, however, accepting this creed is incompatible with claiming that naturalism implies that moral realism is false, for we cannot rule out a priori that science may reveal that there are moral facts and, hence, that moral realism is compatible with naturalism.24\
>Be that as it may, what I would like to point out is that, if naturalism implies that there are no moral facts and if this claim implies that there are no epistemic facts, then naturalism gives us strong reason to believe that there are no epistemic facts. If, however, my overarching argument is correct and there are epistemic facts, then we have good reason to believe that naturalism\'97at least of the kind that is driving the arguments we've considered\'97is false. The apparent price of tying naturalism so closely to moral antirealism is, I suggest, to increase the vulnerability of the naturalist project.\
\
In a footnote, Cuneo criticises our contemporary use of the term 'naturalism', deprecating it as a "philosopher's weasel-word" that "admits of a great variety of incompatible meanings" [@cuneo footnote 22.] [^9]\
\
[^9]: Cuneo says: "(22) Blackburn (1993), Ch. 9 and (1998), Ch. 3, Gibbard (1990), Part II, Horgan and Timmons (1990/91), Mackie (1977), Ch. 1, and Timmons (1999), Ch. 1, are explicit about this. In my estimation, the term \'91naturalism\'92 is a philosopher's weasel\uc0\u8208 word, which admits of a great variety of incompatible meanings. In some senses of the term, I believe that moral and epistemic realism are compatible with naturalism. My use of the term borrows from Rea (2002), Ch. 3.\
\
Cuneo\'92s core argument he phrases like this:\
\
* (1) If moral facts do not exist, then epistemic facts do not exist.\
\
* (2) Epistemic facts exist.\
\
* (3) So, moral facts exist.\
\
* (4) If moral facts exist, then moral realism is true.\
\
* (5) So, moral realism is true. \
\
The first premise he calls the \'91parity premise.\'92 The argument in its favor rests on four \'93salient respects in which putative moral and epistemic facts are similar\'94 (Cuneo 225).  The second stage of the argument for the first premise shows that all of the \'93standard objections\'94 to the \'93objectionable features\'94 of moral facts, should they exist, would also establish that epistemic facts display the same objectionable features. \
\
Cuneo constructs \'93epistemic analogues\'94 of three \'93prominent forms of antirealism\'94 in Chapters 4-7. But each of these strategies for avoiding epistemic realism are false. The first form of antirealism is nihilism of the sort that claims there aren\'92t any epistemic facts and so there aren\'92t any epistemic reasons to believe anything. It follows that there is no epistemic reason to believe anti-realism. Epistemic nihilism can be discarded by all of us who are \'93minimally rational.\'94 \
\
The second strategy is \'93epistemic expressivism.\'94 This strategy is very sophisticated. However, Cuneo pushes the view into a disjunctive critique where expressivism either captures much of our ordinary epistemic discourse but entails that all such discourse systematically misapplies epistemic concepts or doesn\'92t capture our epistemic dicourse at all since it entails that all such discourse does not \'93involved the application of epistemic concepts at all\'94 (226). The upshot is that epistemic expressivism collapses into a skepticism not far different from nihilism. \
\
There is one other form of antirealism I do not summarize here. \
\
Even so, Cuneo has some clean up work to do. He discusses three other objections to his core argument. \
\
\'93The more expeditious manner of proceeding, which I shall adopt, is to concede that the standard objections to epistemic realism considered in Chapter 3 have some evidential force. But, I suggest that, even if we concede that at least a subset of these arguments creates problems for epistemic realism, then at best what these arguments establish is that the epistemic realist must countenance some metaphysical mysteries. If we grant, for example, that the standard objections are right to assume that supervenience relations are brute determination relations not amenable to explication, or that we have no informative account about how we apprehend epistemic facts of certain kinds, or that epistemic facts fail to play a wide explanatory role, then it follows that epistemic realism implies the existence of phenomena that are impenetrable\'97at least to agents with a cognitiveconstitution in an environment such as ours. (If the argument of the last chapter is correct, epistemic reductionism is really no different from realism in this respect; it is no less mysterious in these respects than is realism.) I submit that countenancing mysteries of these types, while perhaps not very attractive in some respects, is a significantly better theoretical option than embracing wholesale epistemological skepticism. Accepting mysteries of these types is, for example, not as such irrational; indeed, arguably, were there mysteries of this sort, they would be among many other mysteries that philosophers must accept (issues regarding the nature of intentionality, qualia, free choice, numbers, and so forth, spring to mind.) Embracing radical skepticism, by contrast, is irrational, for one cannot be a minimally rational agent and accept that there is no reason to believe anything. And on the plausible assumption that, if given a choice between accepting two incompatible positions, the acceptance of only one of which is compatible with being minimally rational, then we should accept that position\'94 (Cuneo 241-2).\

#Chapter X - Scientific Ethics Part 1 - Pursuing without Grasping, The Transcendence and Unity of Ethical and Epistemic Norms\
\
*\'93Every soul pursues the good and does whatever it does for its sake. It divines that the good is something but is perplexed and cannot adequately grasp what it is.\'94 Plato, Republic 505e-506a.*\
 \
##Introduction\
	Most philosophers believe that at least some of our ethical beliefs are really true and that some things are really good. But if the good is real, is it natural or nonnatural? Richard Boyd argues that our term \'91goodness\'92 refers to a set of natural \'93immanent\'94 mutually reinforcing properties that favor human well-being. Robert Adams argues that the good is identical to a supernatural, transcendent God. Good things are such just insofar as they resemble God. Which metaethical position makes the best sense of our (sometimes correct, sometimes incorrect) application of ethical terms in everyday discourse and the historic discipline of systematic ethics? \
\
	These questions embroil us in metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, and semantic considerations. Of course, a full treatment of them here is not possible. As Boyd points out, metaphysical commitments to or against the existence of a god will sway one\'92s ethical commitments. Rather, in this paper, I examine a few facets of the larger dialectic, focusing on written conversation between Boyd and Adams spanning one book and three articles. I offer my own contribution to their conversation. My conclusion is that \'97 even absent independent arguments from philosophy of religion\'97 our most stable and cogent ethical thinking, and our most incorrigible ethical principles, sit better in a framework where the good is understood to be transcendent, and unitary. Adams has the upper hand, I think, for three reasons: (1) Adams\'92 account most accurately explains the intuitive truth that we ought to be open to revising many ethical beliefs but that there are some that we (already) know certainly enough that we ought not be open to revising them. (2) Boyd\'92s homeostatic property cluster idea, though impressive and thorough, is not yet ambitious enough to even aspire to explain the numerous (and apparently irreducible) various kinds of goodness (and beauty, and excellence, etc.) but restricts itself to human welfare, which is only part of an adequate metathics. And (3) epistemic norms are more closely related to ethical norms than Boyd would like to admit.\
 \
>Stephen Darwall (2006: 25) notes that, nevertheless, \'93there do seem to be affinities between metaethical and roughly corresponding ethical theories,\'94 for example, metaethical naturalists have almost universally tended to be Utilitarians at the first-order level, though not vice versa. Notable exceptions to this tendency\'97that is, metaethical naturalists who are also first-order deontologists\'97include Alan Gewirth (1977) and Michael Boylan (1999; 2004). For critical responses to these positions, see Beyleveld (1992), Steigleder (1999), Spence (2006), and Gordon (2009). (Kevin DeLapp, "Metaethics")[@delapp]\
\
>Matthew Kramer (2009: 2) has argued that metaethical realism (see section four below) is itself actually a first-order moral view as well, noting that \'93most of the reasons for insisting on the objectivity of ethics are ethical reasons.\'94 (For a similar view about the first-order \'93need\'94 to believe in the second-order thesis that moral values are \'93objective,\'94 see also Ronald Dworkin 1996.) Torbj\'f6rn T\'e4nnsj\'f6 (1990), by contrast, argues that, although metaethics is irrelevant to normative theorizing, it may still be significant in other psychological or pragmatic way, for example, by constraining other beliefs. Nicholas Sturgeon (1986) has claimed that the first-order belief in moral fallibility must be grounded in some second-order metaethical view. And David Wiggins (1976) has suggested that metaethical questions about the ultimate foundation and justification of basic moral beliefs may have deep existential implications for how humans view the question of the meaning of life. [@delapp]\

 \
##Richard Boyd I:  Homeostatic Property Clusters\
First, a few words on Richard Boyd\'92s metaethical project are in order. Boyd\'92s \'93How to Be a Moral Realist\'94 (1998) essay has been influential in establishing the viability of one kind of ethical naturalism. Boyd is not a non-cognitivist or \'93otherwise deflationary\'94 naturalist. He is interested (along with Sturgeon, Brink, Miller, et. al.,) in justifying moral realism within the bounds of a strict, scientific naturalism. Their project has at least two claims:  ethics is a science (or should be!); ethical inquiry can and should be continuous with empirical scientific inquiries. That is the epistemological claim.  And ethics is consequentialist; Boyd and others think ethical inquiry will involve giving some kind of naturalistic account of our collective human welfare and of those natural properties that contribute thereto. That is the normative ethical claim. \
\
Most of Boyd\'92s writings have focused on the schema rather than the content of a naturalistic moral realism, offering a general framework rather than detailed and comprehensive moral realist accounts, including a list of goods. Even so, in sketching out the schema, he has offered an account of \'93important human goods\'94, both physical and psychological, like food and friendship. Exactly what natural entities and properties count as human goods will become important below. \
\
### Natural Kinds\
For Boyd, goods are importantly like natural kinds. Normal natural kinds, like \'91water\'92 and \'91metal\'92 indispensably feature in our inductive and abductive reasoning.[^2] For example, suppose that I begin typing on a friend\'92s laptop on a cold day, but I notice the keys are surprisingly cold to the touch. My friend points out that his keyboard keys are not plastic but metal. \'93Metal\'94 of course, is not one single element on the periodic table, and so has no one single essence, understood as a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for instantiation. So what is such a natural kind? Certain properties tend to cluster together (conductivity, malleability, etc.), where the presence of each of which makes likely the presence of the others. This understanding of natural kinds is flexible enough to show why \'91metal\'92 can feature in a good explanation (of why the keyboard is cold) and also why exceptional or unusual metals \'97- ones that lack some typical properties \'97 still count as members of the natural kind.\
\
Biological natural kinds follow the same pattern. Tigers are real, and \'91tiger\'92 the natural kind is real. We do not invent, but discover, the nature of tigers.  Yet \'91Tiger\'92 is not one property-instantiation of a simple universal, but denotes a cluster of properties that tend to make likely others in that cluster.\
\
Goodness, Boyd suggests, is just such a natural kind and homeostatic property cluster. Something similar to our application of terms like \'91metal\'92 and \'91tiger\'92 is going on in our application of value terms and the semantic relation to real \'97 but natural \'97  value-properties. Our value talk  is answerable to something in the mind-independent real world: such property clusters. Property clusters like goodness, however, have no one analytic definition \'97 at base, they are not unities but pluralities. Keeping goodness as a natural kind without supplying an analytic definition helpfully avoids the definist fallacy.[^3] Beyond this schema, Boyd thinks that the properties that make up the goodness cluster tend to come together in certain political and social contexts (like democratic, respectful, egalitarian, courteous, educated societies) where we pursue and somewhat successfully achieve human welfare.[^4] So virtues, right actions, laws or policies and so on earn the predicate \'93good\'94 when they \'93tend to foster the realization of these goods\'94 (Boyd 1988, 203). As Adams says (in summarizing Boyd) \'93The good is more fundamental than the right in his view, and well-being or what is good for people is more fundamental than moral goodness\'94 (Adams 2003, 60).\
\
### Transgenerational Scientific Disciplines\
\
The correct account of ethical terms as natural kind terms will also include considerations of the inquiry as a whole, the disciplinary matrix. The disciplinary matrix is an interweaving set of terms and projects shared by practitioners and researchers within a discipline. The terms \'91metal,\'92 \'91tiger \'92and\'91 goodness\'92 are currency in chemistry, biology, and ethics respectively. Our account of them should make sense of how experts in that discipline intelligibly converse, form predictions, and achieve successes in that field. It should make sense of how that field or discipline exists across generations.\
\
Boyd\'92s ambitious project, we can see, is both naturalist and realist. He invokes concepts like natural kinds and disciplinary matrices from his metaphysics and epistemology of scientific realism to build a similar explanation of moral natural kinds and moral inquiry. Unlike \'93deflationary\'94 naturalists like Mackie, Boyd does not take the (shorter, but more problematic) path of denying that goodness is a real thing.\
 \
##Robert Adams I: Being For the Infinite Good\
Before summarizing the debate between Boyd and Adams, we should say a few words about Robert Adams\'92 project. At an opposite metaethical extreme from Boyd, Adams represents supernaturalism. Adams\'92 fascinating Finite and Infinite Goods: A Framework for Ethics is a comprehensive case for, and explanation of, an ethical framework organized around an infinite good (God) who grounds a great variety of finite goods. \
\
Importantly, as we shall see below, Adams places a high premium on being for the Good. This general orientation towards the good with love and allegiance is critical for Adams and for my comments about Boyd\'92s critiques. Why is it so critical for Adams? One reason is that one cannot love all finite goods, yet he sees (and I think rightly) that this inability is not a fault. One can love the infinite good \'97 be devoted to it \'97 without loving an unlimited set of finite goods. In fact, one can love the infinite good in and through loving a limited set of finite goods.\
\
A second reason being for is so important for Adams\'92 account is that we can and ought to love many different kinds of goods: people of various kinds, beauties of art and nature, abstract truths of mathematics and philosophy, and so on. Being for the good (in general) makes sense of our generic aspirations for excellence of many kinds,  and our admiration for those who are able to successful love and exemplify such a variety of excellences, both personal and impersonal. Even when our aspirations are unsuccessful, even in the case of ill consequences of our pursuit of excellence, there is something praiseworthy about the fundamental orientation toward the good.\
 \
###Adams II: The \'93Critical Stance\'94 Tells against Naturalism\
Adams second chapter of Finite and Infinite Goods takes aim at naturalism. Naturalisms, of which there are many, are united in seeing the good as immanent to either the physical, natural world or at least to human nature \'97 our thoughts, motivations, physiology, psychology, and so on. The transcendence Adams argues for includes (at least) three points: The Good itself surpasses every (finite) good thing. Since the Good is limitless, it explains the (in principle unlimited) potential for new instances and kinds of human and non-human goodness and beauty. Finally, and most importantly for our purposes, the Good being limitless explains why we ought to maintain a critical stance Adams argues is indispensable to our ethical thinking. The \'93critical stance\'94 is the key theme I want to trace in this paper.\
\
In Chapter 2, section 4, Adams takes aim at (especially) Richard Boyd\'92s naturalism. The main critique is that (Boyd\'92s sort) of naturalism allegedly excludes a \'93critical stance\'94 that is necessary for any ethical theory. Just what is the \'93critical stance\'94? Adams\'92 own summary is this: \'93For any natural, empirically identifiable property or type of action that we or others may regard as good or bad, right or wrong, we are committed to leave it always open in principle to raise evaluative or normative questions by asking whether that property or action\uc0\u8208 type is really good or right, or to issue an evaluative or normative challenge by denying that it is really good or right\'94 (Adams 2002, 78).  Our ethical thinking and practical judgments must be \'93open\'94 when we judge finite goods to be good. The reason is not (pace G. E. Moore) that we can simply assume the good to be indefinable and then dismiss attempted definitions. Rather, because there is a metaphysical gap between the transcendent, infinite good and any finite thing, our certainty that there is a good is always counterpoised with our uncertainty that this is as good as it seems to us at present. This critical stance is, according to Adams, definitionally a part of our value talk.  He says, \'93I think the critical stance is part of the general intentional framework in which we use evaluative and normative terms, at least where morality and excellence are concerned, and thus affects the semantically indicated role of such terms.\'94 (Adams 2002, 78) To fail to account for it would be a grave error.\
\
What is wrong with Boyd\'92s view, according to Adams? Boyd thinks that empirical knowledge \'97 albeit hypothetical, future knowledge \'97 could be enough to settle a question of value. Adams thinks that the \'93settling\'94 of the question would always and in principle be hasty. Of course, Boyd can accommodate the proper open, critical stance right now, but cannot guarantee that it is the right stance to take in some hypothetical future when our empirical data is perfectly full and adequate.\
\
One final corollary of Adams\'92 critical stance thesis that Boyd also discusses is that some of our moral beliefs are already (prior to idealized empirical justification) more epistemically secure than some well-grounded scientific theories. Putting the matter a little more sharply, Adams says, \'93...it would surely be crazier to give up the belief that it would be wicked to torture children than to say that there must be something wrong with quantum mechanics\'94 (Adams 76). Boyd\'92s naturalist realism seems to entail that even beliefs like the (almost certain) proposition \'91it is wicked to torture children\'92 are as open to revision as the latest beliefs about sub-atomic particles. Despite Boyd\'92s attempt to secure such beliefs under the umbrella of \'91quasi-analycity, that openness, Adams thinks, is far too open.\
\
Somewhat more succinctly and less clearly than Adams puts it, we might say that if a  metaethical theory is true, it must include (in the sense of either justifying or at least not contradicting) a critical stance toward ethical judgments and ethical questions. Boyd\'92s ethical theory \'97 his sort of consequentialist naturalism \'97 does not include such a critical stance. So Boyd\'92s ethical theory is false.\
 \
##Boyd II: Partial Denotation & Epistemic Normativity\
Boyd\'92s response to Adams is, largely, to consent that the \'93critical stance\'94 is critically important (Boyd 2003, 508). So he must show how his naturalism can accommodate it. Where necessary, where naturalism cannot accommodate the \'93criticalness,\'94 Boyd must show how it is not important. Of course, Boyd clarifies, not every stance that qualifies as \'91critical\'92 is desirable. Boyd sketches the \'93critical-stance-on-the-cheap\'94, in which any conclusion \'93not analytically entailed by empirical evidence\'94 is falls short of deductive certainty (2003, 524). Empirical evidence just doesn\'92t underwrite conclusions that certainly.\
\
Of the more substantive openness or criticalness, Boyd thinks it \'93epistemically correct\'94 to take \'93something like the critical stance [Adams] articulates\'94 (2003, 513). We are to be open to new insight, new conversation, new challenges to our ethical conclusions because (a) they depend on empirical observations and empirically-based arguments, and (b) such observations and arguments are \'93complex\'94 and it is difficult to say when they are \'93definitive\'94 (2003, 513). Consenting to this much, Boyd thinks it is false that the critical stance is \'93part of our current conception of ethical reasoning\'94 (2003, 514). So how much and what kind of \'93openness\'94 to reevaluation does Boyd endorse?\
\
Boyd\'92s overall project is to present epistemic, metaphysical, and semantic considerations that defend or increase the plausibility of naturalist moral realism. It would be impossible to summarize his lengthy article entirely. In this section, I shall attempt to organize Boyd\'92s instructive responses under two headings: Partial denotation of ethical terms and epistemic normativity. I shall then summarize more briefly Adams\'92 responses to Boyd before giving my own.\
 \
###Partial Denotation, Externalism, and Quasi-Analycity\
The first consideration Boyd discusses throughout is \'93partial denotation.\'94 This semantic notion does metaphysical and ethical work. Denotation occurs when language users mean to denote k with term t. Partial denotation is the notion that language users mean to and successfully do denote k1 with term t, but at the same time (erroneously and unintentionally) also denote another kind (k2).  For example, the term \'91species\'92 partially denotes (and properly so) the concept of a family of, say, animals, or trees, or systems; it also (improperly) implies that species is the same in animal species and a floral species, qua species. Terms partially denote when they bear \'93a strong reference-like connection\'94 to a kind but the reference-connection is not clean or complete. One way to approach this notion is to think about a natural kind term that has referred to the same natural kind entity for centuries.  How did language users successfully use the term \'91water\'92 (or \'91lead\'92) denote H2O (or atomic number 82) before we had the chemical knowledge that water is (atomically) H20 or the chemical makeup of Pb? Boyd\'92s answer is partial denotation.\
\
This is where \'93partial denotation\'94 comes in to help keep a place for the critical stance. Partial denotation allows us to give credit to early language users and explain their successful application of terms to the relevant properties while also denying them full knowledge of the referents of those terms, and endorsing our own more advanced knowledge. As Adams phrases it, \'93If \'91good\'92 does... indeed signify a real property, there must be a tendency for members of the relevant community of discourse to be approximately right in (much of) what they say about the good, though this tendency may, and almost certainly does, fall hugely short of infallibility\'94 (Adams 2003, 128). Notice that both philosophers are obliged to account for our successes and failures as ethical thinkers, but their emphases are different. Adams can explain why we already grasp the good enough to be for it, but must tell a story about how can err; Boyd can easily explain how we err, but must tell a longer story to explain how we often get the reference of moral terms right.\
\
Another way partial denotation helps Boyd is to develop a plausible externalism. Internalism is the conception that something being good is sufficient reason for preferring it. The good is the admirable, desirable, worthy, etc. by definition. (Needless to say, it may or may not be admired, desired, or ascribed worth \'97 but it is so.) Boyd admits that \'93it is hard to defend internalism and naturalism simultaneously\'94 (2003, 532). As I understand it, Boyd\'92s solution is to offer that some terms that definitionally include \'91worthiness of pursuit\'92 do indeed partially denote things or actions that are worthy of pursuit, but not completely.\
\
How exactly partial denotation works in each case is much less clear. He says that \'93if we are faced with evidence which seems to establish that the term \'91good\'92 refers to some natural phenomenon, P, the moral implausibility of P\'92s being the good can in principle undermine or override such evidence. Moral inquiry has a certain level of autonomy with respect to other areas of inquiry. If one thinks of this autonomy as absolute, then the appeal to partial denotation might be one way to save some sort of moral realism without adopting Adams\'92 solution\'94 (2003, 531). Yet Boyd denies that moral inquiry is (completely) autonomous. He sees ethical reasoning as \'93continuous\'94 with other natural and social sciences, both methodologically and ontologically. Each branch of science has a certain level of autonomy, but none complete. So deliverances from its autonomous domain cannot coherently serve as principles that trump the empirical discoveries of any other domain.\
\
As a particular example, Boyd notes that many approbative terms like \'93just,\'94 \'93fair\'94 and so on tend to be used in contexts where the referents are convenient to the ruling class. The morally implausible conclusion that the \'91good\'92 both refers to \'91the convenience of the ruling class\'92 and that such convenience is in fact good is urged upon us by examining the \'93reference-like relations\'94 between the use of the term historically and the oftentimes referent. We can be mistaken because the convenience the ruling class is not quite what goodness really is. \'93We (let\'92s hope rightly) take ourselves to be informed moral practitioners, and we rely-with serious qualifications-on our own moral judgments as evidential with respect both to the extension of \'93good,\'94 and the aims of moral practice.\'94 (2003, 545)\
\
To take another particular case of moral implausibility, Boyd discusses the proposition that torturing children is wicked. Boyd (borrowing from Putnam) defines some propositions as \'91quasi-analytic\'92 \'97 meaning that \'93even when we know that their justification is a posteriori rather than a priori, we find it extremely difficult to envision circumstances under which they would be disconfirmed\'94 due their \'93conceptual and methodological centrality.\'94 Changing them requires not simple empirical observations but \'93pretty serious conceptual and theoretical \'91revolutions\'92.\'94 He offers two examples of quasi-analytic statements: torturing children is wicked and \'93the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics\'94 (which he does not further specify).  To empirically confirm that torturing children is wicked, the term \'91wickedness\'92 picks out a natural property or family of properties \'93related to human goods and harms\'94 etc., and that our judgments \'93track this family of properties\'94 (2003, 525). Even though the proposition is \'91quasi-analytic\'92, the naturalist must remain open in principle to the possibility that empirical investigation could reveal the proposition to be false (in some cases, at some times, etc.). In this way, Boyd hopes to retain room for a kind of critical stance.\
\
 \
###Epistemic (Morally-Neutral) Norms\
A second key component of Boyd\'92s case is the primacy of epistemic norms. Can the study itself of ethical terms and properties be value neutral? Boyd imagines an intelligent, amoral, non-human linguist who wants to study the semantics of human languages, but who does not itself have any moral commitments (533). Boyd admits that his scientific realism (the analog to which he is trying to compare or with which he is trying to equate moral realism) is not value neutral; but he says it is moral-value neutral. The only norms (or \'93values\'94 if you like) in force are epistemic norms governing, presumably those governing valid inferences, likely hypotheses, and so on. For instance, Boyd says that \'93in deciding what the referent is of a natural kind term, we are seeking to identify... the one which best fits the explanatory role associated with natural kind terms\'94 (2003, 535, author\'92s emphasis). The notion of a \'93best fit\'94 is, of course, normative \'97 but epistemically so only. The only normative judgments \'93involved in determining that the nature of water is H2O ... are purely epistemic judgments about the merits of competing explanations...\'94 (Boyd 2003, 536). Also, strangely, Boyd thinks these norms are hypothetical. He gives a rough example in imperative form: \'93Classify this way if you want to discover true generalizations about how chemical reactions work\'94 (2003, 536).\
\
Boyd extends his account of these epistemic hypothetical norms that govern practitioners in various disciplines in order to show how an amoral extraterrestrial still might be able to identify the reference of the moral terms of \'93moral practitioners\'94 over time, accounting for old errors and new improvements (544). He hopes that these reflections show that one need only endorse epistemic norms to \'93explore the nature of the (moral) good\'94 (2003, 545). In these ways, Boyd tries to bolster his naturalistic account and make room for (one kind of) critical stance.\
\
One final question demands some comment. For Boyd, some of these ethical questions are metaphysically neutral. Ultimately, he believes the kind of openness that is epistemically or morally required depends in some part on one\'92s prior metaphysical views. Boyd thinks \'93that in fact neither naturalistic moral realism nor theistic moral realism has any difficulty in accounting for this sort of critical stance\'94 (2003, 526). \
\
Rather, our approach to the question depends on each philosopher's prior metaphysical reasoning in general, (largely) independent of the conversation about the metaphysics of morals in particular. \
\
For instance, Adams sees our uncertainty about particular ethical judgments (that X is good, admirable, etc.) as rooted in God\'92s infinite nature. The unbounded nature of the good makes the a priori delimiting of goods impossible. That account both Boyd and Adam agree *could* be the right one, that it has some plausibility, that it is at least the right kind of account. \
\
On the other hand, Boyd can build something just as plausible: human nature is such that \'93uncertainty of knowledge of complex psychological, social, political, and economic factors\'94 make a priori delimiting likewise impossible. \'93It is a matter of how we, as knowing subjects, are situated in a complex web of physical, psychological, and social causes\'94 (2003, 529). \
\
But these metaphysical questions Boyd punts to another discussion. He says, \'93I believe, we should do the relevant metaphysics. If you have (largely) independent reasons to accept theism... then you have reason to accept the deeper metaphysical explanation and justification of for moral doubt\'94 (2003, 530). While keeping two difficult inquiries separate is important for clarity, there is a danger to this strategy, as I shall comment below.\
\
 \
###Adams III: On Epistemic Norms\
\
Adams\'92 paper is a warmly approving and thorough response to Boyd\'92s \'93Finite Goods.\'94 They agree on many points. Where they disagree, again, is on the question of a critical stance, on the moral neutrality of epistemic norms, and on the internalism (of identification of the good and motivation).\
\
What is his particular response to Boyd\'92s brand of critical stance? Adams says, \'93We do not endorse the same kind of openness.\'94 (2003, 129) Boyd \'93seems to envisage ... refusing any longer to be committed to being for the good, while still believing that there is a real property... actually signified by \'91good.\'92\'94 (2003, 130). By contrast, Adams \'93assumes that [goodness] gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good\'94 (2003, 130). This is a telling critique, and I shall give my best explanation of the difference below.\
\
Adams also differs from Boyd\'92s putatively \'91value-free\'92 epistemic norms. Boyd insists that the only normativity operative in identifying natural properties to which moral terms refer is epistemic normativity. Adams argues that \'93properly-attuned Eros\'94 is response to excellence in a way that allows us to fix the reference of moral terms. Adams admits that Boyd might be able to \'93domesticate\'94 such a notion into naturalistic account, but the attempt would be dubious. He would have to aver that \'93causal relationships [are] ultimately decisive for the nature of proper attunement of Eros\'94 (Adams 2003, 130).  Adam\'92s response is to strongly recommend internalism. Adams affirms existence internalism when he says he \'93assume[s] that [goodness] is a property that gives reason to favor things that have it, and that thus if properly identified would support a commitment to the good.\'94 (Adams 2003, 130).\
\
Boyd and Adam seem to disagree about what kinds of ethical propositions are up for grabs. Adams summarizes the problem in this way: \'93It is a serious problem, discussed in more than one place in Finite and Infinite Goods, how to hold firm moral convictions, on points on which one ought to have them, without failing idolatrously to acknowledge the distinction in principle between one's own convictions about the good, even on the most obvious points, and the good itself.\'94 (Adams 2002, 128) As I see it, the dual propositions that we both know the good (irrevocably) and don\'92t sufficiently know the good (and so must always remain open) are in tension, but both true. The tension demands \'93a measure of trust, mingled no doubt with caution or distrust, in the stirrings of our own Eros\'94 (131). We can be mistaken about the good and incorrectly apply the term, but we cannot be deeply and pervasively mistaken. The good must be something to which we have \'93epistemic access\'94 and \'93epistemic access in the right way, partly through our Eros and other affective volitional responses\'94 (Adams 2002, 131).\
\
For Boyd, the attempt to settle the reference of value terms might need the kind of objective, third-person perspective of an intelligent extraterrestrial. But this leads to strange conclusions. What would an external observer guess is the reference of the term good? Quite often \'93the convenience for the ruling class\'94, something Boyd does not admire but that does satisfy or seems to satisfy the reference of the term. Boyd tries to keep ironic distance from endorsing this denotation by admitting that it might be (and is probably) only a partial denotation. For Adams even this admission is too near to a horrible falsehood. He says he would rather give up moral realism entirely than endorse the proposition that \'91the good\'92 means \'91the convenience of the ruling class.\'92\
\
 \
##Responses\
Some of my responses I have already hinted at above. In this section I try to spell out with a little more detail some key points in this debate.  I organize my comments under a few three headings: openness, \'93third personal\'94 morality, virtue epistemology.\
 \
###Openness\
I began this inquiry with a quotation from Plato because it captures a tension that we shall see is crucial for understanding the debate between Adams and Boyd. For Plato, two seeming paradoxes are thematic, and recur (I think) throughout these writings. The first is that the good is mysterious even to specialists (\'93dialecticians\'94) and yet plain to everyone. We \'91divine\'92 it, but do not know it. The second is that the good is simple and unitary but underlies and causes a bewildering plurality of kinds of goods.\
\
The first paradox is very close to the internalism/externalism debate, and heart of the Boyd/Adams conversation.  For Plato, the belief that P is good moves an agent to act \'97 or rather, the fact that agents pursue P is due to their generic, overriding pursuit of the good. Good things intrinsically motivate pursuit, and our judgments about what is good or bad intrinsically motivates us, at least somewhat. Yet we can still err in judging the wrong thing to be good or in not pursuing the good well enough. There is a balance that Plato\'92s insight maintains: To emphasize too much our knowledge of the good is to risk undue rigidity and moral hubris. To emphasize too much our ignorance of the good is to risk undue flexibility and moral cowardice. Even today, any ethical theorist has to explain both how we are correct when we think about, talk about, and pursue various goods (beauty, excellence, justice) and how we are incorrect when we err. That we err often is, I hope, obvious. For we do misjudge the good, pursue the bad, whether or not we do so intentionally. That we are not therefore completely or utterly ignorant of the good seems to me equally obvious.\
\
In my reading, one (unstated) reason that being for the good is so central to Adams\'92 framework is the truth in Plato\'92s statement above: We \'93divine that the good is something\'94 (we have knowledge) but are \'93perplexed and cannot adequately grasp what it is.\'94 Plato (and Socrates) see a truth that seems to me critical: we both know and do not know the good. To deny that we know it through \'93divination\'94, intuition, or some such less-than-adequate faculty is to risk betraying the good, to risk not being for the good.\
\
Keeping these dual propositions in mind is the key to my own interpretation of Adam\'92s critical stance. We must hold two true propositions in view at all times. First, that we know the good, somehow and someway. Adams does not call this knowing an incorrigible intuition, but he does seem to rely on it. But secondly, and just as importantly, we do not know the good sufficiently; we don\'92t know it well enough to avoid error. Both propositions, and the tension between them, are essential to clear ethical outlook. To lose one would be like closing one eye.\
\
How do these reflections relate to the so-called critical stance? It seems to the choice of the words \'91critical\'92 and \'91open\'92 are unfortunate. For, one can be \'93open\'94 with regard to first principles or open with regard to conclusions derived therefrom. For example, one should be open to the possibility that one\'92s deductive reasoning, even when the argument seems watertight,  is erroneous in some unforeseen way; one should most emphatically not be open to the possibility that, say, the law of non-contradiction is false. Are there any principles of ethical thinking or practical reasoning that are as irreproachable and incorrigible as the law of non-contradiction is in speculative or theoretical thinking? I think Aquinas\'92 estimation that the proposition good is to be done and evil avoided qualify as propositions just about as fundamental and obvious as any, within an ethical context or outside (Summa Theologiae, 1-2, Q. 94, Art 2). That we know the good well enough for the proposition \'91the good is to be done\'92 to be intelligible seems to me a fundamental truth that Plato and many others have clung to.\
\
Even so, as ethical inquiries (those with long histories and those active today) become more detailed, complicated, and practical, the conviction that option A or B is good becomes more difficult to justify with anything like certainty. So here remaining open and critical is the proper epistemic stance.\
\
Boyd, I take it, would say that our success in pursuing the (real) good by name is due to a partial denotation, and the our failures in pursuing it are due to the fact that the denotation is only partial. But Adams has a stronger explanation for our confident that the good is to be pursued antecedently to any but the vaguest notion of what particular properties are conducive to human welfare. We know that excellence is desirable before we know very clearly or very thoroughly what human excellence consists of. Adams seems right that we can even recognize new and unprecedented forms of excellence when they appear to us, because we have first cognized the good.\
\
 \
###Third Personal Morality\
Now for the second paradox. The Republic quotation highlights that the good is unitary yet causes all kinds of goodness. It is maximally single yet its effects are maximally plural \'97 there are moral goods (virtues, etc.) but also aesthetic goods and many others. The good, therefore, explains all goodness. Like other Platonic forms, the good is the \'91cause\'92 of all good things insofar as they are good. Equality itself is the cause of equal things being equal. Both explain all instantiations of the given property in various substances. But the range of instantiations for goodness seems wider than that of equality. One can eat good food, have a good social standing, enjoy good health, create and obey good laws, contemplate good theories. Adams appropriates this framework to explain the commonsensical notion that there are not just many excellent things but many vastly different kinds of excellence. He says, \'93The things that I take to be excellent \'97  great books, beautiful music, heroic deeds, the dynamic complexity of a living body or an ecosystem \'97 are very diverse, and so are the ways in which they are excellent. I take beauty, moral virtue, and the aptness of a response or interpretation all to be types of excellence\'94 (Adams 2003, 119). Since God is the good, and finite goods are good by resemblance, Adams can account for the dappled and diverse range of incommensurable kinds of goodness.\
\
For the ethical naturalist, a long and difficult account is required to unify all of the things to which we predicate a set of somewhat unified value predicates. If the good is a natural property cluster, Boyd may be quite some distance toward giving an account of just what property clusters are good for us, but he is quite a distance away from giving an account of systems (say, the excellence of an ecosystem) in which humans do not play a major part or any part at all, or of a piece of natural beauty (say, a billion-light-years distant nebula) that has never been and perhaps will never be viewed by human eyes. Intuitively, an ecosystem can be working well, a many-colored nebula can be lovely or admirable even if no (human) appraises it as such. On this front, I think the ethical framework Adams provides is more plausible, other things being equal, than Boyd\'92s.\
\
Traditionally, ethical thinking and practice have included principles and maxims related not only to the treatment of others and the cultivation of virtue but also attention towards one\'92s final end. This comprehensive moral view included what we might call first-personal, second-personal, and third-personal dimensions. That is, one important ethical question is who ought I to become? What is psychological order? A second is how ought I to treat you? And you me? A third is What is the proper purpose of human life? Where are we headed? [^6] Boyd, predictably, makes the same narrow move that many modern thinkers do \'97 that of reducing all ethical thinking and practice down to \'93care for others\'94. When he talks about the particular contents of a normative ethics (to fill out the details of his metaethical framework) he seems to be thinking only of second-personal morality. When he summarizes the \'93problems we face in trying to care for each other\'94 as largely \'93features of social, economic and political structures\'94 (531). He does not think much about human welfare as a species of excellence (say, enjoying excellence as Adams has it), where individual, social, aesthetic, personal goods and so on all participate in the same kind of goodness. The point of these reflections is that the more values we include in our search for a cogent, unified account, the less plausible becomes the notion of homeostatic property clusters for natural kinds. Whether we look at the several different kinds of human goodness, or the innumerable different kinds of nonhuman (aesthetic, biological) goodness, even if we hypothesize that a homeostatic property cluster explains each one, it becomes more and more difficult to even imagine exactly which properties those might be, let alone how one set or cluster of properties is a good-making feature in such different entities.\
\
[^6]: For example, Aristotle writes about eudaimonia as participating in the life of god (3rd-person), about justice (2nd-person) and about moderation (1st-person).  \
\
\
 \
###Virtue Epistemology\
On a related point, Boyd\'92s discussion of epistemic norms assumes that \'93good explanations\'94 can be epistemically good without being morally good. Adams is right to say that Boyd\'92s discussion of epistemic norms is the weakest and also the most opaque of his essay. On Adams\'92 account, moral goodness and epistemic goodness are both species of excellence related similarly back to the (one) infinite good. This latter account much more plausibly fits the prima facie facts. \
\
I can here only gesture to the growing field of virtue epistemology.[^7] The intuitive premise, according to Ernest Sosa, is this: \'93Rational beings pursue and value truth.\'94[^8] Truth is a value; truth is a good thing. My attaining true beliefs is a good thing, and ought to be pursued. This sense of goodness is not, surely, that of moral goodness in the most narrow sense. But are the two senses completely divorced? When a scientist fakes his data and thus demonstrates a defective devotion to truth, we do not hesitate to apply the term bad, without qualification. Intellectual fraud is, among other things, a moral error. If the (correct) epistemic norms we hold and accord to are or plausibly can be moral-value-laden virtues, then all of the reasoning Boyd constructs on the edifice of a presumptive (moral) value neutrality must be rethought.\
\
The [second] criteria above demands we respect the parity between epistemic and moral norms, between virtues of intellect and will. Boyd denies this parity without argument. Unless he can explain why we should not, we will continue to treat these norms as sharing something in common, even while being distinct. \
\
\
\
These considerations are not decisive; they are not meant to be so. As Boyd points out, the relative merits of the metaphysical accounts behind Boyd (atheism) and Adams (theism) will change the background plausibility of the metaethical accounts. But also, might not the sword cut the other way? Perhaps we should say that the relative merits of our metaethical account will modify the plausibility of our metaphysical theory, be it theistic or atheistic. Our metaethical account examines our ethical stance, after all, a stance which is as close to us as our very hearts. Our examinations of theism and atheism are liable to be aiming at a putative reality foreign and far outside us. \
\
Nagel's general direction -- start with defeasible morally realist presumptions and build from there to metaphysics and epistemology -- is right. I am more certain that I ought to care for my children and respect my parents than I am convinced all the world is not exhaustively material nor all the world just my perceptions of an unknowable ideas. \
\
Regardless, our sensitivity to both the \'93progress\'94 of new truths in natural scientific inquiry and the (relative) stability of at least some truths of ethical inquiry can better explain the reality of goodness, our epistemic access to it, and our successful deployment of ethical terms, points to a framework more like Adams\'92, where the good itself is transcendent and yet many (and very different) kinds of things can be good by relation to it. The philosophical naturalist who refuses \'97 rightly so, I think \'97 to retreat to moral antirealism has a tough road ahead. He must fully articulate a plausible framework either that accounts for more natural kinds of goodness, or for other kinds of goodness that are not immediately like natural kinds. But much more so, he must fill in the details of real, natural goodness.\

##Scientific Ethics 2 - Frank Jackson\'92s Functionalism\
\
Frank Jackson is a physicalist, moral realist, and cognitivist (though he laments that epithet). He sees the main problem with moral realism as (an iteration of) the location problem. The key question is how to ground the \'93meaning of ethical ascriptions and sentences in purely descriptive terms.\'94 (Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics 113). \
\
In thinking through Jackson's sophisticated and influential arguments, things are going to get heavy on the metaphysical side of metaethics. \
 \
Frank Jackson\'92s From Metaphysics to Ethics defends the entailment answer to the location problem. The location problem is roughly how to locate ethical or semantic or other queer properties in the world understood in reductive, physicalist terms. Where is truth, meaning, goodness? The entailment answer is roughly that all the subvenient facts (of sub-atomic physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) entail all the supervenient facts (of psychology, ethics, etc.). Just as solidity is not a feature of the physical story of a physical thing but it is implicit in or entailed by that story about an interlocking atomic lattice, so tallness is not a property that features in the story about the physical heights of various people in the room but tallness is entailed by their various heights. \
\
Conceptual analysis is the process of drawing out these entailments and understanding the relation between base and supervenient property. Jackson defends \'93conceptual analysis\'94 against objections that it is a mysterious search for the a priori or that conceptual analysis was discredited by Quine. \
\
He says metaphysics is about "what there is and what it is like", not a "shopping list" but a limited list that explains everything else.  The list of basic ingredients ought to be smaller than the list of explananda. \
\
\'93Serious metaphysics requires us to address when matters described in one vocabulary are made true by matters described in  another. But how could we possibly address this question in the absence of a consideration of when it is right to describe matters in the terms of the various vocabularies? And to do that is to reflect on which possible cases fall under which descriptions. And that in turn is to do conceptual analysis.\'94\
\
He is a cognitivist in that hbalfoure thinks \'93ethical sentences are truth-apt... semantically able to have a truth-value.\'94 (Jackson 113). Cognitivism is compatible with subjectivism, so long as the ethical judgment in question (say, \'93I like that\'94) is semantically able to have a truth-value. Since language is a physical tool (sounds and signs and so on) for conveying information, to \'93represent things as being\'94 this and not that way (Jackson 114). Language \'97 at least, language about contingencies \'97 sorts out possibilities into categories of those that are and those that are not. This account includes conditional statements like \'91If P then Q\'92 where \'93competent speakers [say such things] just when the conditional credence of Q given P is high enough in the circumstances for assertion\'94 (Jackson 116). \
\
In the \'93Role of Folk Theory\'94 Jackson summarizes and endorses a few folk or common sense judgments about ethical properties. \
\
\
Ethical and normative properties referred to by ethical terms like \'93rightness\'94 and \'93wrongness\'94 are real properties. He clarifies that he is \'93not taking a stand on the debates over universals in analytic ontology, but merely affirming that truth supervenes on being, and that successful predication supervenes on nature\'94 (Jackson 118). \
\
Ethical properties supervene on descriptive properties, meaning that for any two possible worlds if they have all the same physical properties then they have all the same ethical properties. \
\
The role that \'93rightness\'94 plays in folk morality serves as a raw material from which to start and goal toward which to strive when looking for the descriptive condition (call it M) that is extracted by the Ramsey-Lewis method. But not just any current folk moral proposition will serve \'97 it must be mature folk morality. Mature folk morality is \'93where folk morality will end up after it has been exposed to debate and critical reflection\'94 (133).  Ethical properties supervene on the comprehensive list of physical properties in question. \
\
The divide between \'93is\'94 and \'93ought\'94 is not a divide between semantics. Jackson says, \'93I have to regard the purely descriptive terms as essentially given by a big list of terms that would generally e classified as such, and see the aim of the exercise as the analysis of ethical terms in some way or another in terms of this big list\'94 (120). Moore would object. Moore\'92s assertion that goodness is a non-natural property Jackson summarizes as the claim that \'93what is left of language after we cull the ethical terms is in principle inadequate to the task of ascribing the properties we ascribe using ethical terms\'94 (121). I could not, sans evaluative terms like \'91beautiful,\'92 \'91lovely,\'92 \'91shapely,\'92 \'91lush,\'92 \'91gorgeous\'92 etc., really describe what a rose looks like by just describing its color, shape, size, chemical composition, lifespan, etc. \
\
Jackson is agnostic about whether mature folk morality will indeed ever converge into one, coherent, universally agreed-upon whole. He believes it will, but accepts the possibility that a fundamentally plural set of moralities is in fact the mature set (Jackson 137).  \
\
\
The bottom line, however, is clear: \'93any ethical way of carving up how things are is equivalent to some descriptive way of carving up how things are\'94 (Jackson 139). This is a strange conclusion: it is in one way too open and in another way too closed. It is too open about exactly what description will correlate isomorphically to a particular evaluation. He has concluded that it is possible that what is right (evaluatively) will have in every case some descriptive correlate. What he hasn't concluded is that what is right is what \'93maximizes expected hedonic value\'94 or any other such thing. This openness Jackson seems to prize, calling it \'93ecumenical\'94 (Jackson 142). But I don\'92t see why he should. On my view, we already know that maximizing pleasure is, on balance, a good idea. Most pleasures are innocent pleasures that involve no corruption. Most pleasures *can* admit of excess and so when they are combined with moderation can be enjoyed. What we don\'92t know (or maybe some of us know but the rest of us don\'92t agree) is whether the meaning of the term and fact of maximizing pleasure is identical to the meaning of the term and the fact of goodness. Jackson's conclusion is too closed in that it makes moral progress or moral discovery a species of scientific progress or factual discovery. On my view, we already know what it will take something more than scientific discovery to open new moral horizens. Jackson's thought makes the saint someone who through experimental methods discovered something new about the world, a new description that correlates to a new evaluation. The astonishment we feel at moral heroism is just a species of the astonishment we feel at first learning, say, that sub-atomic particles can act on each other at a distance, or that time is relative to the speed of light rather than vice versa, or that water bears (tardigrades) can survive in deep space. I find this highly implausible. The saint is someone who astonishes us with magnanimity, patience, courage, extraordinary love, and so on \'97 who opens up distinctively moral horizens. \
\
	\
##Open Questions\
\
The open question argument applied to Jackson is fairly clear: even supposing that an action A has the proper descriptive property D under conditions M such that it satisfies the role mature folk morality assigns to rightness, is it actually right? That is, does it satisfy my (or our) assigned role of rightness as we understand it today? \
\
Jackson defends himself against the open question argument in two ways. The first defense is that mature folk morality is still maturing and so we should not expect it to be complete. Some ethical truths are not extant and won\'92t be for an indeterminate amount of time. Some openness is to be expected. If we ask him \'93is it actually right?\'94 he can respond that we don\'92t know for sure but time will tell. \
\
Two critical responses, at least, are called for. The first problem is that \'93time will tell\'94 is not the right kind of openness. As Boyd makes clear, some ethical judgments are quasi-analytic in that they are so true it is almost inconceivable that they should ever turn out to be false; they could never imaginably be vetoed by any future discovery of physics or psychology. In Jackson\'92s terms, some pieces of folk morality are already maximally mature. The judgments, say, that torturing children for fun is cruel and that cruelty is wrong, (bad, impermissible, unlawful, disrespectful, unnatural, painful, vicious, or whatever other imprecation you like) have been sufficiently subject to debate and critical reflection. Indeed, I would argue that anyone willing to seriously \'93debate and critically reflect\'94 on whether or not torturing children for fun is actually wrong by that very willingness demonstrates a moral defect. \
\
A second problem is that the term \'93mature\'94 is evaluative. When some philosophers define truth or rationality in terms of an \'93ideal observer\'94 who is fully informed and critically reflective, they slip into the descriptive definition an evaluative or prescriptive notion \'97 that the observer is ideal in a positive sense. Jackson does the same. It would be too crude to paraphrase the notion of mature folk morality as the moral principles of people who are correct.  But there is something of circularity in trying to ground the evaluative property D in purely descriptive terms when one of our descriptive terms is evaluative. \
\
Jackson might respond that \'93mature\'94 is only evaluative or normative about intellectual processes of debate and reflection rather than about ethical or practical processes of action or sentiment. Again, as we saw in response to Richard Boyd <ref>Boyd on intellectual or epistemic virtues<ref/>, evaluative terms like reasonable and rational are not ethically neutral. Arguably, they are centrally related to ethical evaluations. It is wrong to be intellectually dishonest. \
\
\
Jackson distinguishes what is open and what is closed abou folk morality by distinguishing \'93general principles broadly stated\'94 (Jackson 132, original emphasis). The normative principles he cites are instructive: \'93killing people is normally wrong; we agree that people wo claim to believe that somethign is very wrong but show not the slightest incliniation to refrain from doing it are in some sense insincere; we agree that certain character traits associated with the virtues are intimately connected with the persons\'92 dispositions to o what is right; and so on.\'94 (Jackson 132). The specifics are, however, liable to \'93a great deal of disagreement\'94 (Jackson 133). \
\
Jackson includes in his account what I have called the paradox of knowing and not knowing the good. The distinction he draws is that folk morality gives us the raw material, so to speak, of most \'93initially appealing\'94 parts of morality of which some parts survive as plausible by being vindicated by \'93critical reflection\'94 (Jackson 134-5). For instance, utilitarians must give up (as an exceptionless moral rule or first principle or quasi-analytic statement) that it is always wrong to punish the innocent.\
\
\
Anscombe criticizes utilitarian (or any other consequentialist) philosophy on just these lines. \'93It is a necessary feature of consequentialism that it is a shallow philosophy... it has in fact been the mark of all these [consequentialist] philosophers that they have been extremely conventional; they have nothing in them by which to revolt against the conventional standards of their sort of people; it is impossible that they should be profound\'94 (Anscombe, \'93Modern Moral Philosophy\'94). The problem is that we might being \'93open\'94 to reconsidering an ethical standard that should be closed. One fundamental aspect of being an ethical or moral person is refusing to reconsider certain norms. Anscombe continues, \'93But if someone really thinks, in advance, that it is open to question whether such an action as procuring the judicial execution of the innocent should be quite excluded from consideration\uc0\u8209 -I do not want to argue with him; he shows a corrupt mind.\'94 \
\
Jackson may not show a corrupt mind, but he does play the dangerous game of reconsidering quasi-analytic, necessary-seeming propositions. But this game must be played by any ethical theory. That\'92s just the way it goes. He says, \'93We tease out the consequences of the view or views under discussion; we identify those that seem most at odds with current folk morality\'97 in other words, the consequences which strike us as most counterintuitive; and consider whether we are prepared after critical reflection to accept the consequences, that is, to modify folk morality so as to accord with them.\'94 (Jackson 135). \
\
##Ramsey Sentences\
A Ramsey sentence is a conceptual apparatus invented by positivist Carnap to explain why metaphysical questions are meaningless unless they can be translated into empirical sentences. \
Ramsey sentences take an apparently meaningful folk sentence like \'93Electrons are real,\'94 empty the theoretical content, and replace it with empirical content that is supposed to do the same assertoric work. \
\
For a philosopher like myself who has never one been tempted by the charms of positivism \'97 a hopeful but hopelessly incoherent dream that knowledge can be made clear, mundane, and irrefutable to any one with five senses \'97 it is hard to build a conceptual structure on such a flimsy conceptual foundation as Ramsey sentences. But even so, let us take them seriously. \
\
One critique is that Ramsey sentences do not do the actual work of correlating ethical (prescriptive or evaluative) and non-ethical (descriptive) properties. They just show a theoretical way such a correlation might go. Jackson admits that ethical vocabulary is indispensible \'93in practice\'94 (124). How does one acquire the possibly infinite disjunction of descriptive properties that correlates to the term \'91wrong\'92, and how does one deploy it in a dispute with one\'92s sibling, if one is only five years old? \

The sophistic charm of Jackson\'92s account comes from talking a lot about carts and horses but reversing the cart and horse. The true ethical properties make a possibly infinite disjunction of descriptive properties true, not the other way around. \
\
Jackson\'92s account points to a correlation \'97 at best, an isomorphic correlation \'97 between ethical and descriptive properties, between our uses of the term \'91right\'92 and the role, exhaustively described, played by rightness. \
\
\'93Fairness is what fills the fairness role; rightness is what fills the rightness role; and so on\'94 (Jackson 140). \
\
David Enoch objects along similar line.\
\
>\'93I am going to grant that every normative property is necessarily co-extensive with a natural one. What I am not going to grant, then, is the identity of necessarily co-extensive properties. The common examples that are used as (purported) counterexamples are things like triangularity (having three angles) and trilaterality (having three sides), or the property of being the number 2 and the property of being an even prime,10 or \'96 more closely to our context \'96 the property of being an obligatory action and the property of being such that it is an essential property of God to command all persons to perform it (assuming some suitable version of a divine command theory).11 Intuitively, it seems that these are distinct properties, even though they are necessarily coextensive. Of course, proponents of the argument above may just dig in their heels, and insist that in these cases too the seemingly distinct properties are actually identical (though the relevant concepts may be distinct, of course). And so we find ourselves at a frustrating impasse\'94 \

\
##Functionalism is not Metaphysics Objection\
I have long puzzled over how functional theories (of consciousness, morality, etc.) have gotten by under the appellation of metaphysics. If I asked an astronomer what a planet is, he might reply with some examples: \'93Mars, Venus, Earth.\'94 And if I pressed him to give me not just examples but a definition, he might say \'93a massive spheroid orbiting the sun.\'94 But suppose I press him on that criterion by citing the 43 Kuiper Belt objects that are massive, spherical, and orbiting the sun. We are still, I think, talking about physical object. He could reply that we don\'92t exactly know what counts as a planet, but that size and the amount of orbital room the object has between its neighboring objects seems important to our definition. Well and good. But if he said that a planet is \'93whatever fills the planet role\'94 he seems to have given up talking about physics and objects. Does he really mean that \'91whatever\'92 it may be that turns out to fill a planet role is a planet, whether it is physical or not? That it does not ultimately matter whether the object is even in deep space? For perhaps I could build pieces of architecture or technology that occupy the planet role, and could therefore build planets. 	\

# Chapter x Objections, Clarifiactions, Conclusions\
The labor of the essays comprising this dissertation has been to defend the claim that human virtue is not (merely) a part of nature, and that virtuous humans are not (merely) part of nature, if by nature we mean the non-living or the living non-human parts of existence. \
It has not been my task to defend the claim that virtue is real. Moral nihilism or radical skepticism are still viable \'93outs\'94 from this conclusion for those who want to avoid it but who are persuaded by the dilemma. In this chapter I would like to very briefly address the anti-realist or nihilist option. Building off the moral realist arguments from Shaffer-Landau, Thomas Nagel, Philippa Foot, and more, I defend the claim that the best understanding of the facts of our moral thinking and the best explanation of our moral behavior are the realist understanding and explanation. Other explanations are so obviously false that they can only be tenable in light of the threatening consequences of becoming a realist. Other explanations are not soothing, comforting \'97 they bring us face to face with the \'93horror of the normative.\'94\
Philippa Foot concludes Natural Goodness with an essay on Nietzsche and moral skepticism. Is skepticism a rational possibility? \
\
###Draft 2\
The labor of these chapters has been to defend the claim that virtue theory of a paradigmatic sort is the most adequate explanation we have of a non-trivial set of explananda that puzzle us when we reflect on life as lived, and that the question of whether such a theory is \'91naturalistic\'92 is misguided. Ethical naturalism, depending on how one takes the term, is either inevitably going to succeed or inevitably doomed to failure. Such a range of intension is not philosophically tolerable. Rather, I have argued, the unambiguous and meaningful question is whether we must opt for a theistic ethical naturalism or an atheistic ethical naturalism. \
\
\
##Nature and God\
Two broader metaphysical considerations merit a returning comment. The first is about the concept of nature. If nature is just that which is, then it is a truism and a tautology to say that naturalism is a true doctrine, where \'91naturalism\'92 is the thesis that only nature exists. Saying \'93only nature exists\'94 just means, on this account, \'93only things with natures exist\'94 or better yet, \'93only that which exists exists.\'94 I dare say only a madman would earnestly disagree. \
\
So on the one hand the doctrine that only nature exists is true but trivially true. On the other hand, the doctrine is question-begging and (in my view) false. If \'93nature\'94 is just physical stuff, then at least the statement \'93only nature exists\'94 is synthetic and not tautologous. On this account, of course, naturalism cannot but be physicalist. There is no \'93relaxed naturalism\'94 on this view. And it won\'92t do to assume physicalism without argument, especially in the face pressing reasons (from the ethical considerations about virtue inter alia) to believe some values and virtues and even our own human nature is not physical in this sense. But the present case is much worse than just begging the question. The attempt to clarify that takes \'93nature\'94 to mean \'93physical stuff\'94 will not do. Because the Greek word physis (\uc0\u966 \u973 \u963 \u953 \u962 ) from which we derive \'93physical\'94 \'97 exactly like the Latin word natura from which we derive \'93nature \'97 just means the inner core or essence or real substance of a given entity. To speak of God\'92s physical properties is quite literally to speak of what properties he has by nature, as opposed to by choice or convention or some other way. To say that the soul is physical is to say that the soul has it\'92s own nature, essence, form, underlying substance, hypostasis, or reality. At least, that is what those words might mean. So to assume that the very word \'91physicalism\'92 gets us to what we might want \'97 a denial of spooky stuff \'97 is already moving too fast, let alone assuming that the doctrine we are (futilely) expressing is true. \
\
What does the naturalist want to affirm or deny by claiming \'91nature\'92 as his own special metaphysical or epistemological ally? Perhaps she can take recourse to ostensive definitions. Ostensive definitions (like Frank Jackson\'92s) point to familiar exemplars of natural objects, tables, mountains, badgers, stars, etc. and define \'91natural properties\'92 as those \'91needed to give a complete account of things like them\'94 (183, quoting Jackson, From Metaphysics to Ethics, p.7). First, a non-naturalist can \'93insist that moral properties\'94 need be included in a complete account. Secondly, we cannot just assume that tables, mountains, badgers, stars are merely physical in that what appears to be is fully what is. It turns out that the table appears solid but is composed of an interlocking sub-atomic lattice shot through with empty space (or so we now surmise). Since \'91atom\'92 in Greek signifies \'91uncuttable\'92, the \'93atoms\'94 of the early 19th century are not actually atomic; what seems to be uncuttable, the smallest elemental bit of matter, turns out to be composed of hadrons (either baryons or mesons), which hadrons are composed of quarks, which are composed of... etc. As scandalous as it may sound, not even physical things are necessarily just physical. \
\
\
##What are we trying to explain? \
The explananda that our metaethical theorizing aims to explain is not easy to define. Here are some things I don\'92t think we are trying to explain: we are not trying to give moral guidance to the morally confused. Most people have firm moral convictions on a wide range of issues. Theists have ready-made moralities on a wide range of issues given to them, they take it, by god. Atheists as it happens often have a wide range of moral beliefs based on the responsibility we have as humans if we are alone in the universe and solely responsible for our destinies, our disasters, and our hopes. In An Atheist\'92s Guide to Reality by Alex Rosenburg, as a popular middlebrow example, he lays out how atheists ought to approach personal, interpersonal, and political challenges that life puts before each of us. By contrast, Peter Kreeft\'92s  Making Choices is a theistic version of much the same guide. There are certainly moral disagreements at a cultural level, [which we have already had occasion to mention: abortion, sexual ethics, family ethics, international law, legal policy, foreign policy, poverty and wealth, religious freedom, freedom of speech, etc.] and within sub-cultures and even within each of us. But disagreement is most often between parties dedicated to a firm moral conviction. We are therefore not doing metaethics to give the morally confused a bit of advice. We are usually doing metaethics to examine why we have the moral beliefs\
\
What we are puzzling over is normativity. In light of naturalism broadly construed \'97 in light of modern empirical science and reductive philosophy \'97 we are puzzling over the contrast between norms and everything else non-normative. Everything that is puzzling, from naturalistic assumptions, about moral norms is equally or almost equally puzzling about epistemic norms, as Professor Cuneo has labored to show. For this reason, it would be wrong-headed and myopic to speak only of moral norms. \
\
We are not just examining a few words, like \'91goodness\'92 or \'91right.\'92 To read some metaethicist literature, one would think that the only puzzle about ethics is the perpetual recurrence in all evaluative and normative discourse of the English word \'91good.\'92 We are not just puzzling over language merely but intentionality in thought, speech, discourse, and in deliberation. That is, normativity as it shows up in everyday utterances like \'93that was a good movie, thanks for the recommendation\'94 or she is a good teacher; you should take her class\'94 but also much more: Normativity shows up in my private thoughts (\'93how can I lose weight? what is wrong with my health?\'94) in communication (\'93what do you think of your Sienna? Is it better or worse than your old Odyssey?\'94) and in deliberation (\'93what is to be done with Iran? Is Guantanomo Bay to be shut down?\'94). We are trying to explain the pervasiveness of normativity. \
\
First I have to show you why it needs explaining. Then I have to show you why a paradigmatic moral realism enriched by virtue theory is such a satisfying explanans. Finally, I have to show you why other some other theories are not so satisfying on some or all explananda. Some of these theories at which I will level critique are virtue theories, but others are not. The ones that do not rely on (or even mention) virtue I show to be significantly conceptually impoverished by contrast to virtue theoretical approaches. The the ones that do rely on virtue attempt to remain in the fold of naturalism broadly construed. So I have to show that such an attempt is misguided. My argument that trying to make virtue theories naturalistic is misguided has two parts: the first that \'93naturalism broadly construed\'94 gives up on the core naturalist tenets that motivate naturalists to avoid non-naturalism in the first place. Such a broad construal is naturalistic in name only. The second part that naturalism excludes the notions of virtue altogether. \

\
Is our good limited to our biology?\
\
It seems that what is good for us, the full Ranger set of good actions, good dispositions, good character traits, virtues, admirable qualities, intellectual virtues, etc. are fully determined by our biological nature, our status as mammals, our status as organisms, our status as living items in the natural world.\
\
One. For the semantic and linguistic structure of a valued of judgments about human behavior and character are identical in the salient respects to evaluative judgments about plants and animals. foot.\
\
2. Neo Darwinian orthodoxy says that the prime directive, the and, the final cause, the function of all living beings is to reproduce. Or to live long enough to reproduce. Or to live, to survive as an individual, and as a species, species survival which necessitates reproduction. This is Steven Brown's view.\
\
I answer, what is good for us is part of what is good simpliciter determined by our human nature which is part biological and part rational nature. \
\
To circumscribe our good to our biological goodness, what is good for our body, is a mistake on two points. One, as Socrates pointed out, our psychology is far more important than our biology. Two, one would have to reduce all psychological flourishing to biological. This prospect is dim. Even if it were to happen in the distant future, it hasn\'92t happened yet and doesn\'92t seem likely. \
\
1. This is partly true but not fully true. To go partway is a mistake, but a different mistake then going to wrong way. To rectify it you do not need to change directions, but keep going. Our  physiological nature determines some things. Putting arsenic in a glass and drinking it or offering it to another is wrong. But there is nothing, I suppose, categorically wrong about it.  The wrongness if you like super jeans on facts about our body and digestive system and facts about arsenic that entail that arsenic consumed would kill human being. The species of intelligent Martian for him arsenic was not poisonous but tasty changes things. \
\
2. Non-reproducing humans are not ipso facto defective.\
\
\
\
2\
\
Is good limited to human or rational interests?\
\
1. It seems that what is good is only a category existing because of or known only to humans because humans are, so far as we know, the only rational creatures in the cosmos.\
\
\
Is rape really wrong? \
It seems that rape is not wrong. For rape on rare occasion leads to pregnancy and new life. As with lower animals, a resistant female being the unwilling carrier of a strong male\'92s brood leads to that individual\'92s genetic proliferation and to the survival of the species. \
\
On the other hand, rape is clearly wrong. \
\
It is not merely lack of consent. It is violence done to the heart of a person. \
\
\
####Is  the meaning of 'good' fixed a posteriori by 'what is good for human flourishing as individual, society, and species?'\
\
1. It seems that it is so fixed, for what else could 'good' refer to but what is good for us? \
2. Also, \
\
On the other hand, we are supposed to care for the environment partly for our sake and partly for its own sake. \
\
I answer, every living thing has a good. And even some nonliving things plausibly have a good, or deserve treatment in some way. Artefacts and natural objects might demand something of us; we might be governed by norms with respect to them. \
Imagine this thought-experiment: Joe is sitting on his porch one day in Wilmore, Kentucky, sipping a glass of bourbon on the rocks. An interdimensional being suddenly appears at his side. The being appears both benevolent and intelligent. After some effort warming up its vocalizing organs (quite unlike our lung/tongue/larynx system), it utters, in English: "Hello Joe. I am from distant universe completely unlike yours. You will never reach it by technology or magic, but we can freely transport here interdimensionally. My people are dying of a grave and terrible illness. The only cure, our doctors and priests have discovered, is the blood of a human. A single drop of your blood, extracted in less than a second and without pain or side effects, would be converted to an anecdote and mean the difference between our extinction and our survival. The prophesies indicate that you are to be that human, but we could be wrong. In fact, due to a miscalculation of the severity of the illness, if we do not act immediately, our demise is near. Will you allow me to extract the tiniest drop of your blood?" \
\
Now, science fiction is useful for rendering interesting scenarios. The question is, is Joe obligated to give his blood? There is not, I think, any conceivable benefit to Joe. The procedure will not be pleasurable; it will not increase his health (and there is some reasonable fear that it might harm him, despite the being's assurances); it will not increase Joe's wealth; it will not appreciably affect his reputation -- in fact, if he tries to *tell* anyone about the interdimensional being, he stands to lose. The *only* benefit I can imagine Joe receiving is the peace of mind, in quiet hours and in old age, that he (may have) helped a distant race of intelligent beings. And it is hard to see how what makes this peace of mind pleasant except the thought that *I feel good because I did the right thing* . It is ridiculous to suppose he thinks  *It was the right thing because it feels good.*\
\
The point is this: The norms that we ought to treat other rational agents as we (rational agents) want to be treated are just that universally-applicable and binding. Where seconds before Joe didn't know of the existence of these interdimensional beings and wouldn't have believed it if he heard of them in a story, now (through its speech and earnest plea for help) he recognizes them as, in a real sense, his brothers and fellow creatures, evolved from the same protoplasmic life in another universe or breathed into by the breath of the same God. At the same moment Joe knows that they exist, that they are rational agents, and that they need help,  at just that moment the norm springs into place and acts with full force, prohibiting, permitting, and requiring certain courses of action freely available to Joe. \

Epistemic realism \'97  a family of views whose core thesis is: there are (some) epistemic norms; knowledge is (sometimes) obedience to these norms; and terms (sometimes) successfully refering to the facts feature in our discource. \

##Introduction thoughts\
Moral realism is a defeasible presumption. That means it's true that there are moral facts until we can prove that it's false with a really sound objection. Naturalism claims to provide such a really sound objection.\
\
 The objection is that values are just too different from facts. I call this the "disharmony" objection or the "radical discontinuity" objection. The feeling is that, at bottom, all of reality must have a commonality and unity to it. All the various *realities* must connect up somehow. This feeling is, I believe, behind Darwin's search for a common ancestor for all the multitudinous life forms we see on the earth (not to mention in the fossil record). Why else would anyone, aware that there are billions of beatles, birds, whales, marmots, guanamos, gnats, elephants, and dogs even *think* of searching for one organism that -- however long ago -- is their universal parent?  \
 \
 Thomas Nagel has said that the apparent discontinuity between "objective" and "subjective" -- and exploring the two-- defines almost all his works.[^16] Stephen Brown says that a "fundamental tenet of naturalism is that human beings are continuous with nature" (Brown 2008, 4). \
 [^16]: Nagel thinks that the two perspectives are irreconciable. Our best bet is detached, disinterested awareness of both perspectives. When affirming one seems to make impossible affirming the other? Affirm the paradox. \
 \
 On this objection, if values are different from facts, if moral facts are so different from nonmoral facts, then something must be wrong. \
 \
Their are a variety of available responses to the dissonance objection. One is to give up naturalism: \
\
* Moral facts are nonnatural but they're real, so get used to it. Reality just turns out to have two fundamentally different and in a sense irreconciable kinds of facts. This is G.E. Moore's and Shaffer-Landeau's choice.  \
*  Another is to give up moral realism. Nature is real; values are not natural (or they're just too different from the natural) so these putative values or moral facts have got to go. This is Mackie, Ayer, and Gibbard, Blackburn et. al., \
*  A third way is a spectrum of negotiations and compromises with naturalism that each attempt to keep as much moral realism as possible while doing as much justice as possible to our respect for science. This third way is what I am interested in. It's not that I do not see how one could give up moral realism, I just cannot do it. I find it psychologically impossible to live as if it *might* be OK for me to, rather than feed and clothe and educate my kids, to put them in a freezer. [^15]\
\
 [^15]: ![Woman puts kids in freezer](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/detroit-bodies-found-freezer/70419644/)\
\
\
For instance, we could say that only nature is real and only what is natural can be known but argue that values and moral facts and so on are natural. But what do we mean by natural? \
\
* Could mean that values are endemic to human nature, to humans, and that humans are natural. Examples: John McDowell, Philippa Foot.  \
* We could mean that values are features of the natural world just like natural kinds. Example: Richard Boyd. \
* Values could be natural the way that health is natural and anything that produces health. Example: Paul Bloomfield.\
* Still others might argue that values are natural that supervene on normal natural facts the same way psychological fax super being on normal physical facts. Example: Frank Jackson.\
\
But the fundamental tension between "inside" and "outside" might itself be a misunderstanding. That seems to be one of John McDowell's main points. \
\
What if the objection from discontinuity or dissonance is misguided? It seems that "science" supports reductive materialist metaphysics but what if our "respect for natural science" demands nothing of the sort? Then the objection against realism weakens. And its inherent plausibility and truly amazing explanatory power shines forth again unabated. \
\
###Demystifying values as "just part of human nature"\
Some try to naturalize values by just putting them all  (or discovering them all) within humans. I don't think this strategy works. It doesn't demystify values, it re-locates the msytery. If all these mysterious non-factual value thingies floating around with no apparent connection or meaning in the natural world are all somehoe internal to human nature, and humans are natural, then all those values are natural, right? Yes, or human nature has just become non-natural. We used to have a "fact/value" split but now we have a "fact/human" split. \
\
To see how human rising values doesn't demystify values that actually makes humans mysterious, consider the cycle of euphemism. A phenomenon like human fecal matter is impolite to talk about. So we invent a euphemism like "feces." The euphemism works for referring to the same stuff without impoliteness for awhile. Then some kids get ahold of the term, realize what it means, and (having no taste) find it uproariously funny. They make enough jokes to *impolitisize* the polite term, shucking its dignified veneer. We invent another euphemism like "scat". To my knowledge, no one has yet turned "scat" into an exclamation expressing surprise or disapproval.  \
\
To his credit, McDowell sees the parity of epistemic and moral norms. He wants to subjectivize moral norms, so he accordingly subjectivizes epistemic norms. Virtue and reason are *both* transcendental idealized processes, intersubjective human processes, objective enough for our purposes and to explain the objective purport in our thinking, feeling, and acting, but subjective enough to respect the distinction between human nature ("second nature") and *nature* nature (primary nature). \
\
Even so, second nature remains radically discontinuous from primary nature. Others, like Stephen Brown, not to be deterred want to naturalize human nature too. \
\
\
\
\
\
## Finlay\
Finlay admirably summarizes the meta-ethical landscape with a taxonomy of views. The pressue is to satisfy objectivity (no values, just facts) and subjectivity (values). Michael Smith says something similar: "The task of the philosopher in meta-ethics is to make sense of ordinary moral practice. But the problem is that ordinary moral practice suggests that moral judgments hve two features that pull in quite opposite directions" (Smith 1994, 11). \
\
\
## Theses\
\
1. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of human nature. \
2. Humans are natural -- that is, we are radically continuous with nature.\
3. Normativity is an internal or necessary part of nature. \
4. To begin our understanding of ourselves by studying all that is not us (stars, trees, rocks, amoeba, giraffes) is insane; to begin our understanding of all that is not us (physics, chemistry, botany, biology, astronomy) by studying ourselves is perfectly reasonable. \
5. Nature includes *ends* (teloi) as well as value-properties like goodness and beauty. \
6.  Normativity for human nature means: We really ought to think in certain ways and act in certain ways.\
7. Number six is not all of nature's normativity. \
8. Excellence and beauty are both goods but different from each other. \

## Self-Written Reviews \
\
"Buhler has written an important contribution to metaethics. And an impressive analysis of both metaphysical and normative ethical issues in the ongoing discussion of naturalism." John Smith, University of Iowa\
\
"When people ask me what naturalism is, I no longer point them to David Papieneau now, but the introductory chapters of Buhler's book. It resoundingly refutes a few nonsensical positions, clarifies a few sensible ones, and highlights the most reasonable." \
\
"Moral realism's fire is burning hot, and dealers book helps us to see that this is not A flash in the pan. Moral realism especially combined with virtue theory, is the most powerful! We have of the world we live in, the people we admire, and the people we aspire to be." Scott Smith\
\
"A pugnacious and tightly argued cogent case for metaethical realism, sensitive to the historical context of these long-standing debates, but dancing circles around the faulty presuppositions of contemporary thinkers."\
\
"A book of resounding philosophical common sense bristling with persuasive arguments and adorned with, I dare say, wisdom."\
