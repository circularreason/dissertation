\f0\fs28 \cf0 In the last five chapters, we have seen why there is excellent reason to believe moral realism is true and seen both theoretical and practical benefits of following a broadly Aristotelian virtue ethic. We have also seen that the metaethical theses belonging to  empirical moral realisms are inadequate to explaining our ethical lives, the way that our evaluative thought, talk, and action is vastly diverse yet unified under a single or a few evaluative predicates, like \'91good\'92, and \'91true,\'92 and \'91beautiful.\'92 \
We have articulated the four objections from naturalism, all of which amount to the discontinuity objection: that human nature and human rationality, on Aristotelian virtue ethics, are painted as radically discontinuous with nature, as \'93other,\'94 as something sui generis and apart. \
Finally, we have critiqued some versions of \'93naturalism\'94 that are, frankly, unthinking, dogmatic, and incoherent. We have given an account of science that is defensible and coherent, which delivers an account of naturalism (which defines itself with reference to science) that is also coherent. From the ashes we have argued for a novel version of naturalism that accommodates the core concerns of naturalists but is defensible against the iterative demarcation problem. \
In this chapter, I return to the four objections and spell out exactly how neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is naturalistic in our new and defensible sense of the term. \
