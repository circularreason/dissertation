\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 A virtue such as honesty or generosity is not just a tendency to do what is honest or generous, nor is it to be helpfully specified as a \'93desirable\'94 or \'93morally valuable\'94 character trait. It is, indeed a character trait\'97that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say \'93goes all the way down\'94, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker\'97but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset.\'94\

\'93The concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its possessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or admirable person who acts and feels well, rightly, as she should. These are commonly accepted truisms.\'94[@sepvirtue] }
