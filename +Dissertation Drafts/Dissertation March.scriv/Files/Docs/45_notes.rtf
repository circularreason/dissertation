\f0\fs28 \cf0 My late father, Rich Buhler, once told my uncle \'93Keith dropped out of high school, but he will be the first one in the family to earn a doctorate.\'94 Dad, I hope that I have made you proud. My sister Kristi always believed in me and told me that one day I would be working as a professor. The first person who ordered me to go to graduate school was John Mark Reynolds. John Mark, I have finally fulfilled the plan we dreamed up. J. P. Moreland taught my first graduate school class in philosophy and used tough love and tough arguments to show me how hard and how rewarding this kind of research can be. Without Gary Hartenburg\'92s timely writing advice and hearty encouragement, I could not have survived the application process. David Bradshaw\'92s tireless, patient, gentle, and exacting academic leadership has shown me not only excellent scholarship but an excellent life. My first and final dialectical partner is Lindsay, whose conversations have been the school in which I have learned and still learn to love beauty and truth. \
