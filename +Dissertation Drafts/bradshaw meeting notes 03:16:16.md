1. Foundations and content - order? Sounds intuitive. 
2. Tone - combative and concise? Ecumenical and wordy -- can see either way working. Like things that are punchy and to the point. Be fair to opposing view.s



Any rational agent? or any human?
The good simpliciter (simplichitear)
Metaphysics, Lambda 10, God is the Good.
Part of our humanity is our ability to step outside our own skin, create novels? Is our animality relevant to moral constraints for someone who has transcended their biology or does their rationality -- by itself -- constrain us?

Worry is about THE SCOPE OF THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN.

Part of rationality is an obligation to come to the correct understanding of reality, then that would be true for any rational agent. Any rational agent should use its rationality well? In truth, not all reality matters equally. Insignificant truth (alpha centauri). The relaity that has relevance for us is the relaity we interact with, depend upon -- that's delimiting the relvant scope of reason... 

This is relative to our human life form. 

The paradox here is: as human beings, we wish to know what is true (not just for human beings). 

Address it implicitly. It may be explicit. Are you trying to derive morality from biology? Wouldn't be true for an android? 

Practical reason constrains us; our animality constrains us, which questions can we pose? which truths can we pursue? Answering that is a job for practical reason. 

If we had different senses, we'd have inconceivable concepts. Our current conceptual range is limited. That constrains theoretical reason. It's never divorced from our animlaity, anyway. 

As nietche says, if It's just this thing we do, the way spiders spin webs. THen you've sawn off the branch you're sitting on. To be able to maintain that, you have to conclude... what Plato and Airis that reason doesn't suffer from these limitations. Reason particpates in divine reason. 


-- Some attention to the nature of reason. Not just something we humans happen to do. It has to be assumed to be something that apprehends the nature of reality. Even despite all the limitations we as human reasoners do have. 

Going the way of high pagans is well worth exploring. Seems to me that's a great project. 

Big ugly chapters -- then reduce. 

Write something and try not to look at it for a month or two.

Question for Dr. Bradshaw: 

* What do you want? 
* What do you want from me? 
* What do you want from my dissertation? (A first good word)
* What do you want from me to finish this project? 
* You have to do what HE wants. What's my ticket out of here. Not flat acquiescence, but giving them what they want. 
* You're buying your ticket. Once you are free, you can do whatever you want. You're not giving in. 


PRACTICE:
* Thank you for aproving chapter 2.
* Here's chapter 4-6. I've revised them. I want to get this done in the most expedient way possible. How can I do that?  _One thing._
* I need to be clear: rather than this, you're suggesting this to finish expediently. Is that correct?
* What is YOUR hopes for me finishing? If you were to have a timeline, what would be your hopes? 
* I'm going for clarity. I need to know what Bradshaw is thinking. So I'm not wondering. I want to be doing my best. I'm grateful that you're taking the time to work with me. I want to do my best not just for you but for my future. 
* A second series of questions: what do you want from me? Clarity. I've got 7 chapters. What do you want from me to wrap this up? FOCUS ON CLARITY. Not him telling me what to do, but clarity for finish. 
* What kind of a timeframe do you envision for this? I want to be doing my best work; and I'm very grateful for what I have here; it's also very important for my wife and children and family. And then what do you envision would be necessary to get that done?

Quotes:
Sounds like I'm arguing for a form of natural law. 
Reminds me of Aquinas' treatise on natural lw. 
Basic goods as living things, then as mammals, then as human beings. 
Not clear to me how they're connected.
BUt he does talk about virtues.
He's connecting divine law to human nature.
Someone like Dan will harken back to Sartre. Existenstialism -- is it humanism?
There's no such thing as human nature. Radical freedom. Students find it apealing. There's no higher authority. There's no inbuilt necessity. Rejecting metaphysical telos and scientific determinism. Sartre took it as his starting point. Camus took it as his starting point. Dan knows that literature very well. 
A lot of that goes back to early modern philosophy, Cartesian dualism. Your ethical life is determined by your will. Your will is a rational faculty of choice, with no reference to our bodily life, situating us within the natural world. 

My general sense -- I think this is actually shaping up very well. Chapter 2 is very impressive. You draw on this extensive literature. Digging into this literature about teleological realism. You deploy that very nicely to create a space for what you want to go on to do. You've successfully scoped it down so that it fits within a chapter. Last time you didn't close the circle of the argument; this time you did. 

A few places you could trim down. I marked those. 

Chapter 3. In terms of the pacing, and the writing. This is very good. I'm very happy with the direction. 

My biggest problem -- What is the normative force of the position you're advancing?

The key sign of pacing is as I read do I feel like I'm learning something new at each paragraph. Without going too fast, feels like you're skipping things. 

Who am I writing for. Writing for your committee.

Pretty much adequate. 

Chapter 4 follows pretty much. Seems a natural development.

Chapter 3 and 4 post pone the question of obligation and normativity. It's necessary to flesh out the theory. 

#### 78 - what kind of moral obligations accrue to ME, the individual? Let's grant that. This is the first moral claim. You can raise it and try to address it. Or you can bracket it. I will address this later. Don't want to raise it casually. So what do you think you're showing? Certain traits that the human species need to have; or human individuals 

#### Take out robert george footnote

#### 85 - Never potentially a rock star. "What they potentially become" is too sweeping. You can clean that up with more careful language. 

#### Second worry -- a worry about neo-Aristotelian in general. Human telos entails individual telos. Maximos says human telos, plus individual telos. Creating each of us as individuals. Our individiual meaning and purpose. Our calling, our vocation, "Our individual essence", not so much what we are but what we are to become. Opens up a space that's very ipmortant for those that are pursuing God in ways no one else has done before. 

#### What about the not-paranoid hermit? 

#### Remove passages that bring up worries? Up to page 78, it's fine. REader knows to be patient. That's your strategy. NOrmative implications of your view of human nature and excellences. Are going to be dealt with at that point. 

I (Bradshaw) have the sorts of questions that come from thinking about saitns. Dn will have questions about Sartrian radical freedom. Holiness came to be recognizes as requiring the rejection of social norms. That was secularized within existentialism. He and I are going to have similar issues. 

#### 85 - every virtue is a kind of purification. Why not the neoplatonic view? Virteus are forms of achieving purity from the passions. How is your view consistent with other radically different views of virtue. How does mine relate to that? 

At some point to address the normative questions... Otherwise it's just sort of anthropology, sociology, ethicists want  to know -- what I'm morally obliged to do.  

Chapter 4: the bee and the sting, a nice little quote. Some bees need it to be the kind of bee that they are. THe value of being a worker bee is your contribution to th elife of the hive. WHY "NEED" a virtue? for what? To be what you are. But what... 
I see that human society needs people with virtues, or needs virtues... But do I need to be virtuosu, moderate, and self-controlled? Maybe they're like the worker bee. There are a lot of members of society.  We're human beings. We're social beings. We're political animals. The farmer... because of my social role.... I don't have time to be wise. Wisdom is at a higher level. As long as I'm meeting my immediate duties. Similar things for a soldier. My social role is under command. Given the distinctive roles in society, and limited opportunities. In sense are all these virtues obligatry. 

#### Look at the politics. More so than say, the gazelle. Because we have language, we're able to make moral distinctions. Moral, linguistic, social. 

#### We need them ... why? to be fully developed humans? to Why am I obligated to care about being a human being? Why be human? In the pursuit of radical freedom... I don't want to be human. I resent the limitations of humanity. I deliberately go out of my way to show I am not bound by those limits. The neo-AristotelianAristotelian project wants to fit us into nature, like being a bee. Find what's distintive to our species, but what's distinctive to us as humans is our ability to want to be something other than human... a dog is bound by dogness. a human is bound by humaness.


#### Interact with the underground man? Is he irrational? In the Kantian sense, inconsistent. There is something rationally inconsistent about denying the categorical imperative. Paris Hilton. You're failing to chaieve humanity. 

I have a hunch this question will come up from Anita. Why be moral? Because you must. 

#### Read Sartre, Existentialism -- is it Humanism? Camus, Sisyphus. There is no meaning or value to be found in the objective structures of nature. Just whatever we create and decide upon. Meaning and value are always human creations. Does he argue or presuppose that? The way he articulates it is so "obviously" true. 


#### Chapter 4, mainly clarify the word 'need'. Natural necessity. Our discussion has made it clearer. 


#### Chapter 4, "acquirable". Higher mathematics is acquirable in the species, but not in a lot of us; achievable for everyone. Acquirable for whom, under what circumstances -- some courage is more courageous relative to the starting point, the hand your were dealt. 


#### Chapter 4, list of virtues. Generosity and magnificence. Generosity on a large scale. Specific.

Aristotle has a helpful distinction between natural virtues. Distinguish that from courage properly speaking. A hexis (a habit). For aristotle courage is defined by reference to immediate danger, but situations such as death in battle, and honor at stake. Other forms of courage in relation to that. Courage facing physical pain of any kind. Dentist's chair. Courage facing emotional pain. That involves facing up to ways you've been wrong. Way's you've hurt people, self-examination. Another point: just because courage is a mean between extremes doesn't mean you can't be both reckless and cowardly. You can be reckless in order to avoid facing up. There's a further ring of facing commitment, making commitment. Don't have courage to make commitments. Other people have let them down. They've let people down. 


#### What does it mean to acquire a virtue. You can be strong in some ways, and weak in others. You can take ... every virtue is a hexis. 


#### The good as one understands it at the beginning of the quest. That's not the only test of the good that's relevant. It has to actually be good. It has to be rationally adequate. It may take work to to discover which good.  


#### 116 - state a bit more clearly. Don't need to state that much about what is a tradition. Just society.
