### Outline

Section 2 explores McDowell's essay "Virtue and Reason" for a qualified defense of his thesis that virtue is a form of practical knowledge, including an initial perceptual sensitivity to the salient facts of a situation with the skill to do what is required by those facts. 

Section 3 highlights an ambiguity in McDowell's contrast between 'moral' and 'practical' reasons. He confuses the genus for the species when he classifies the broader sort of practical reasoning as narrowly 'moral' reasoning. I attempt to remedy this confusion by putting in historical context the relationship between 'moral' and 'practical' reasons. McDowell confuses two frameworks for approaching ethics: the 'quandary frame' and the 'character frame.' 

Section 4 offers a more coherent alternative. It reprises the argument that human beings are practical reasoning animals by placing our distinctive activity in context of the general inclination of all living things to their own life and health. In this light, practical reasoning is necessarily substantive reasoning about ends, rather than a merely instrumental one about means, because in order to have any reasons at all one must have a first principle of practical reason, namely, a general evaluative conception of what is to be pursued and hence how to live. 

Section $ returns to the challenges listed above, and discusses McDowell's responses as well as my own. For instance, by this definition, practical reasons can and do motivate (by themselves). Hence, practical reasoning is both practical and reasonable by definition. I also respond to the objection that this neo-Aristotelian account of practical reason defines away immorality. My response is that this account places vice and immorality in clearer relief as practical mistakes arising from evaluative mistakes.
