\f0\fs28 \cf0 ### Remaining tasks: Tradition and telos\
\
The remaining tasks are three: first, we must understand this process in light of our human telos. Second, we must understand it in light of the inherently social nature of rationality. \
\
And third, we must return to the question of organic naturalism to understand the process of practical reasoning in light of our animal nature and our place in the biological and physical order. Wallace and McDowell both help us to see the importance of identifying our human telos, which will be explored in a later chapter.}
