\f0\i\b\fs24 \cf0 Abstract: 
\i0\b0 What is the purpose of metaethics? On one popular view, the purpose of metaethical theories is simply explain our moral talk. Now, our moral talk is not a simple, singular phenomenon: We evaluate people for their moral and intellectual qualities, and we also evaluate living things, systems, and non-living things. I call such a broad range of evaluative talk \'93normative discourse\'94. Metaethical theories try to explain or should try to explain such normative discourse. So in the debate over naturalism and non-naturalism, we cannot simply give an account of narrowly 
\i moral 
\i0 normativity and leave it at that. By applying this criterion, I critically appraise Richard Boyd\'92s concept of homeostatic property clusters and Robert Adams\'92 concept of \'93being for\'94 the good. \
