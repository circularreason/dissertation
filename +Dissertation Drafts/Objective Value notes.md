## Objective Value

The term 'objective value' is unfortunately common. I do not think it expresses the notion charitably. A better way of phrasing it would be to ask whether there is any reason to do anything at all. Put this way, it is more clear that every sufficiently matured human organism naturally has reasons to do some things, to pursue some ends, and reasons not to do some things, to avoid other ends.

Objective practical reasons. 


## Fight

Where the materialist and idealist are fighting over the definition of primary nature, the unrestricted conception refuses to fight. Instead, it embraces both body and mind, brain and consciousness, matter and form, as existing on a single continuum. That continuum is, ex hypothesis, neither merely material nor merely formal, neither merely mental nor merely physical.  






## Solutions


I briefly discussed the Irrelevance Problem above. McDowell sees natural norms as irrelevant to practical, rational norms because he endorses bald naturalism when it comes to natural, scientific reasoning but endorses social naturalism when it comes to ethical reasoning. This dualism makes the practical, normative dimension of nature appear detached from the theoretical, descriptive dimension, when they are more adequately understood as dimensions of one and the same world.  Jennifer Frey says: 

> ...the ethical naturalist must be able to show how ... these two seemingly different senses of good (the good we can derive from an account of what simply is and the good as practical goal) can be unified into one and the same account. That is, we need an account of natural normativity that will show us how the relation between a general judgment articulating some fact about a life form (a judgment about a fact that is potentially known from the outside) and a judgment concerning a particular bearer of that form in a particular situation, can take the form of a practical inference whose conclusion is an action that exemplifies that very same form of life.[@frey 65]

The Footian solution is to insist that the two forms of judgment are different ways of apprehending the same fact. The zoo keeper can apprehend the life form of a sloth bear only "externally"; and the sloth bear, not being endowed with logos, cannot apprehend its own life form internally. When it comes to human beings, we can apprehend both ways. For example, a rational alien who did not share our life form can only apprehend the life form (practical rational primates) externally just as scientists can apprehend our life form externally. But a rational human being can *also* apprehend the selfsame life form "internally" by reflecting on who and what we are. The facts do not change when we alternate between the two points of view. 

If both forms of knowledge grasp the same object, then the putative opposition between natural facts and practical reasons is dissolved. General judgments about a life form unite with practical inferences that are to be acted upon.  Since practical reasoning *does* contribute to the process of deciding on a course of action, we can see how norms which are perceived as objective and external become recognized as relevant and binding. 

Despite McDowell's concession to bald naturalism that "the" modern scientific picture excludes the space of reasons, on my account, natural scientific reasoning is no less evaluative than any other expression of reasoning. Hence, "the scientific worldview" is capacious enough for natural norms, even on various restricted forms of naturalism. That is, scientific reasoning can be about *about* chemicals, quarks, mathematical models, biological life forms, or functions -- and more importantly, scientific reasoning includes both the external, descriptive point of view and the internal, normative point of view. The normative point of view simply is one of the scientific points of view. Natural, organic norms (including those of human beings) are part of the modern scientific worldview.  For human beings, scientific reasoning is natural reasoning; and practical reasoning is natural reasoning.


## Conclusion: Recursive Naturalism

This chapter laid out four requirements that neo-Aristotelian must meet and critiqued McDowell's own attempt to meet them. Taken recourse to a distinction between "first" and "second nature" does not explain but mystifies the place of human norms within the natural order. By contrast, the Footian alternative illuminates human norms as instances of natural norms obtaining in all organisms. If we take an unrestricted view of nature that absorbs the aesthetical, the ethical, the logical and so on, then it is merely tautologous to call it 'natural' when human beings engage in normative practical reasoning and reason about normativity. But even if we take a restricted view of nature to exclude some sorts of entities as non-natural, the kind of natural normativity that includes human practical reasoning should be included as natural. 

If I were pressed to coin a new term to describe my Footian organic naturalism, I would call it "recursive naturalism." Nature "recurs" within itself. Defining human beings practical rational primates entails that we are the one natural organism who reasons about natural organisms. We can observe the pattern of recursion in each element of the argument: Humans engage in natural reasoning about all sorts of things, including natural reasoning itself. We practically reason about practical reasoning. One of our (basic) natural functions is to discover (in greater detail) what our natural function is. Having a virtue (in part) enables us to become more virtuous. Being practically wise enables us to discern when and how to pursue more practical wisdom. Since human beings are natural organisms, and practical reasoning is natural to our life form, practical reasoning is natural reasoning.





Like the materialist, he still wants to wield "non-naturalism" as a rhetorical weapon against some; but like the idealist, he wants to wield "philistine scientism" as a rhetorical weapon against others. McDowell claims to deny dualism by employing an unrestricted conception of nature while fully endorsing a restricted conception of nature. The McDowellian picture nature is both restricted and unrestricted. 








By Fink's lights, classical materialism is the same as McDowell's concept of bald naturalism. It is a form of restricted naturalism for it affirms that whatever is material is part of nature, and so that the label 'not-natural' applies to whatever is not material (or not obviously material, such as ghosts, souls, and fairies). 

It is obvious that idealism and materialism are in competition, but Fink's insight is that they are competing for the same prize: the copyright on what will be given as the *first* and *natural* side. Idealism and materialism turn out to be *identical* in one respect: they offer a "restricted conception of nature" and relegate to a "secondary" status everything that is not "natural" in the privileged sense. The unrestricted naturalist disagrees with both, declining to offer, in advance, a definition of primary nature. The unrestrecited naturalist embraces both body and mind, brain and consciousness, matter and form, as existing on a single continuum. That continuum is, ex hypothesis, neither merely material nor merely formal, neither merely mental nor merely physical. 

Is there any rational adjudication between these dramatically different conceptions?  
While stipulation can create consistency and clarity, it cannot settle the underlying philosophical dispute. Indeed, I would suggest, that the call to stipulate one's definition is merely a temptation to beg the question. 











What is my alternative? 

My view is that organisms (including human beings) are part of the natural order -- and that organic norms (including human norms) are natural. It is clear that, on unrestricted naturalism, this view poses no problems. What about restricted naturalism? Like McDowell, I think that bald naturalism and the restricted, mechanical conception of nature is refuted by the existence of human beings and other organisms. It excludes, ex hypothesi, fundamental categories such as organic life and human reasoners. It is what McDowell calls "philistine scientism."[@mcdowell1979virtue 346] Fink says, "McDowell has convincingly shown that what Bernard Williams calls the absolute conception of reality is merely restricted, bald naturalism ideologically presented as absolute (MVR: 112â€“31, esp. sect. 5)." [@fink 219] Wilfred Sellars provides a pure specimen of such question-begging:  "I mean that naturalism takes nature in a definite way as identical with reality, as self-sufficient and as the whole of reality. And by nature is meant the space-time-causal system which is studied by science and in which our lives are passed."[@sellars1927naturalism 217] Note that the first sentence explicitly endorses an unrestricted conception of nature while the next sentence secretly slides the ball into the other cup, overtly stipulating that the "space-time-causal system which is studied by science and in which our lives are passed" is "identical with reality." Whether that stipulation is true is the very question at hand. (No one disputes that unrestricted nature is all there is; but some do dispute the implicit assumption that the space-time-causal-system is all there is.)

I have argued in chapter 2 that even on some restricted forms of naturalism, the best evidence from biology suggests that there are such things as natural norms. We cannot build a scientific account of any organism without them. The picture of nature that emerges is one in which the natural and normative world coincide at the level of biological life. As Thomas Nagel says, the existence of value seems to be coextensive with the existence of living things.[@nagel2012mind 117.] 

If I were pressed to coin a new term to describe my version of Footian organic naturalism, I would call it "recursive naturalism." Nature "recurs" within itself. Defining human beings practical rational primates entails that we are the one natural organism who reasons about natural organisms. We can observe the pattern of recursion in each element of the argument: Humans engage in natural reasoning about all sorts of things, including natural reasoning itself. We practically reason about practical reasoning. One of our (basic) natural functions is to discover (in greater detail) what our natural function is. Having a virtue (in part) enables us to become more virtuous. Being practically wise enables us to discern when and how to pursue more practical wisdom. Since human beings are natural organisms, and practical reasoning is natural to our life form, practical reasoning is natural reasoning.









A third flaw with McDowell's account is incorrigible relativism. 




Where the materialist and idealist are fighting over the definition of primary nature, the unrestricted conception refuses to fight. Instead, it embraces both body and mind, brain and consciousness, matter and form, as existing on a single continuum. That continuum is, ex hypothesis, neither merely material nor merely formal, neither merely mental nor merely physical.
