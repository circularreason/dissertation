I'll first state the outline of the argument in syllogistic form, and then work through each piece with more detail. The first syllogism establishes the possibility of ethical naturalism against the is-ought gap objection. 

**Syllogism 1**

1. If some propositions are genuinely both natural and normative, then ethical naturalism is possible. 
2. Generic propositions are genuinely both natural and normative. 
3. Therefore, ethical naturalism is possible. 

The second syllogism makes good on the possibility of this sort of ethical naturalism, positing some actual normative content: 

**Syllogism 2** 

1. If some generic statements describing natural entities are true, then some facts are both genuinely natural and normative -- there are "natural norms." 
2. Some generic statements describing natural entities are true. 
3. Therefore, some facts are genuinely both natural and normative -- there are "natural norms."

The third syllogism effects a transition from generics about the biological world in general to generics about human beings, which will provide the basis of normative *ethics*. 

**Syllogism 3** 

1. On ethical naturalism, all generics can be used as premises in arguments with normative conclusions. 
2. Some true generics are about humans. 
3. So, there are some human natural norms. \


Now, it is no secret that one can prove one's conclusion by assuming, at the outset, a premise which logically entails one's conclusion. This practice is not necessarily vicious. If nothing is postulated, nothing can be proved. Yet it is all to easy to alienate one's readers on the first page, rendering the entire case that follows an empty exercise. All that a philosopher can do is judiciously select starting premises that one's interlocuters can agree to.
