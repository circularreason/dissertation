# Starting Points

It is no secret in philosophy that to prove one's thesis one must begin by assuming, on the first page, a premise which necessarily entails one's conclusion. 

Such reasoning is, in one sense, circular and so may appear vicious: *Why should I grant your first premise?* the reader might ask. But in another sense it is not vicious. For any case intended to establish that *p* must take some point q or r as a hypothesis. Even if one tries to establish that q or p, one will do so by assuming s or t, and the problem reiterates. If nothing is granted, nothing can be proved. 

The consequence of this reflection is that a great deal depends upon one's choice of starting premises. 

My starting premise is this: **some generic, scientific statements are true.** That is, some of our empirical observations, and our rational reflection upon such observations, and our conclusions in the form of "generics" (to be explained below) which are scientific conclusions derived upon such reflections and observations, are true.

So for example, even by laymen's terms I observe that the penguins appear to be birds (they have beaks, feathers, lay eggs, emit squawks, etc.). I reflect that most -- if not all birds -- have many of these macro features. I consult my encyclopedias, biology or zoology textbooks, or friends who are zoologists, and ask them whether penguins indeed are birds. They all confirm the categorization. From observations and reflections such as these, penguins earned an entry in the annals of scientific knowledge. They get a scientific name ('sphenisciformes'), a somewhat speculative, half-formed evolutionary history, and increasingly detailed descriptions of their characteristics, genetics, environments, diet, predators, and so on. The scientific conclusion, upon initial observation, bolstered by reflection, is the statement that: penguins are birds.

My premise is that some such statements are true. Alternately, it is false that every such scientific statement is false. 

The denial of my premise is, I think, an absurdity. That is not to say that the denial of the premise is not worth considering. It might well be true. My point in calling the denial 'absurd' is to say that if it is true, an absurdity is true. If it is true, then the truth is absurd. And reality itself might well be absurd. I don't think it is, but there have been many philosophers who have thought so, and such thoughts cannot be justly dismissed without consideration. The absurdist (let us call her) who thinks all such scientific statements are systematically false would cheerfully deny that "suns are stars", "water is H2O", and "humans are mammals." She would renounce the bizarre belief that the earth orbits the sun or the unconscionable faith that earthquakes are caused by tectonic plate shifts. She is free to deny my thesis. 

Every premise is an invitation to a set of readers. Simply by beginning my inquiry with the assumption that "God exists", I invite fellow theists, and repel all but masochistic atheists; by beginning with the assumption that "no god exists", I invite fellow atheists (and repel all but masochistic theists.) 

My premise that some scientific conclusions are true invites fellow scientific realists, rationalists, and empiricists to the inquiry. It disinvites (though they are of course welcome to eavesdrop) philosophers of different persuasions: transcendental idealists, nihilists, scientific anti-realists, and so on. 

Another term for what I have called 'scientific statements' is generic statements, Aristotelian categoricals, natural-historical statements. Andrew Bailey's recent paper summarizes generics in the following way: 

>We treat ‘we are animals’ as a generic... What are generics? A fine question, but a difficult one. Start with this sentence: ‘Buddhists are way into meditation’. This first sentence is, let us suppose, true. So far so good. But is it equivalent to ‘for every x, if x is a Buddhist, x is way into meditation’? It does not appear to be. For the second sentence might be false (some Buddhists might not be way into meditation) even if the first sentence is, as we have supposed, true. The first sentence could be true, somehow, even if not all Buddhists are way into meditation (similarly, ‘ducks lay eggs’ may be true even if not all ducks lay eggs, ‘mosquitos carry dengue fever’ may be true even if only a very few mosquitos carry that virus, and so on). We are now positioned to observe one curious property of generics: they admit of exceptions. Generic animalism, accordingly, may admit of exceptions without threat to its truth; generic animalism is consistent, for example, with the thesis that there are human persons who are not human animals. [bailey2015animalism 869]



## The thesis

Without further ado, my thesis is that some human attributes -- traits, habits, actions -- can be known to be right or wrong because of the natural, scientific, teleological facts about human beings as a species. 

Such a thesis will feel absurd to some readers. I invite them to justify the feeling. In the meantime I shall try to prove that the thesis follows from the assumption that some scientific statements (derived from observation and reflection) are true. Readers are welcome to join the absurdist in denying my first premise; and they are of course welcome to try to find a weak link in the chain of reasoning, though I hope there is none. But if they accept the premise then they are not free -- not free rationally to deny the thesis. 

## The argument in brief

To get from the premise to the conclusion we need a few steps: 

1. Some scientific statements are true. 
2. In general, some scientific statements are normative and evaluative via natural teleology; the have natural species terms as subjects and evaluative terms as predicates.
3. Some subset of these (scientific statements that are normative/evaluative via natural teleology) are true. 
4. Humans can be the subjects of scientific statements; the species 'human' can be the minor term of logical propositions. 
5. Some scientific statements in which 'human' is the minor term have evaluative terms as predicates. 
6. True scientific evaluative statements about humans denote what is right or wrong. 


In short: 

Data: Some true scientific, generic statements about human beings are teleological, normative, and evaluative.

Evidence: If some scientific, generic statements about human beings are teleological, normative, and evaluative, then some human behaviors and traits can be known to be right or wrong because of the natural, scientific, teleological facts about human beings as a species.

Conclusion: Some human behaviors and traits can be known to be right or wrong because of the natural, scientific, teleological facts about human beings as a species.

## The argument

Premise 1 I assume, and take for granted. 

Premise 2 needs some arguing. Here, Philippa Foot's arguments are needed to show that the critic cannot deny 2 without denying premise 1. No sooner have I been told that penguins are birds than I am told "All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above." Talk of being shaded *for camoflauge* is, of course, normative talk. Such talk is, more specifically, teleological talk. Natural teleology makes possible scientific, evaluative statements. 

Premise 3 follows from 1 and 2. Some scientific statements are true; some evaluative statements are scientific; therefore some evaluative statements are true. 

Premise 4 needs some arguing, but I think it is fairly easy to prove to be true. Since human beings are animals, and all animals are natural entities, human beings are natural entities. 

By calling us 'natural' I do not mean to invoke here all the controversies surrounding the word; more on that below. For now, calling us 'natural' is an innocent truism. Are we here, in nature? Yes. Are we material -- not necessarily *wholly* material, but are we *at least* material at all? Yes. Do we eat food grown on earth, drink water from the earth, are we born from fellow humans and do we die and disintegrate into the earth like every other living thing? Yes. So we are natural. Again, I do not mean to prejudge the question of whether we are *also more than natural*. I simply mean to invoke the obvious that the *we are at least natural*.

Since we are (at least) natural entities, and since scientific statements are about natural entities, then it is possible (and indeed quite common) to make scientific statements about us. 'Humans emigrated from Africa about 200,000 years ago' is a statement about a natural species group, namely *homo sapiens sapiens*, the only extant members of the hominin clade. 'Humans are language users' is a generic scientific statement. 

Premise 5 is, again, not too troublesome. If some scientific statements are evaluative (via natural teleology) and humans can be the objects of scientific evaluative statements, then some statements about human beings are evaluative via natural teleology. 

Statement 6, the conclusion, is true just in case that some scientific statements with evaluative predicates about humans are true. Those statements would give us knowledge of right and wrong based upon what facts about the human species. 

## Premise 2 -- Some scientific statements are teleology

> Natural teleology is unorthodox, but it has a long and honorable history. For example, in 1953 the evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley argued that it's in the nature of nature to get more advanced over time. "If we take a snapshot view, improvement eludes us," he wrote. "But as soon as we introduce time, we see trends of improvement."

>More recently, Kevin Kelly, founding editor of Wired, made the case for teleology as clearly as could be in his book What Technology Wants: "Evolution ... has an inherent direction, shaped by the nature of matter and energy." That is, there may be laws of nature that push the universe toward the creation of life and mind. Not a supernatural god, but laws as basic and fundamental as those of thermodynamics. Robert Wright said much the same in Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny: "This book is a full-throated argument for destiny in the sense of direction." Those books prompted discussion among the literati but little backlash from evolutionary biologists. Ruse thinks that's because the authors are science writers, not scientists: "At a certain level, it's their job either to give the science or to put forward provocative hypotheses, and nobody takes it personally."



>The paleontologist Simon Conway Morris, at the University of Cambridge, has argued that natural structures such as eyes, neurons, brains, and hands are so beneficial that they will get invented over and over again. They are, in effect, attractors in an abstract biological space that pull life in their direction. Contingency and catastrophe will delay them but cannot stop them. Conway Morris sees this as evidence that not only life but human life, and humanlike minds, will emerge naturally from the cosmos: "If we humans had not evolved, then something more or less identical would have emerged sooner or later."

>Stuart Kauffman, of the Santa Fe Institute, who argues that the universe gives us "order for free." Kauffman has spent decades on origin-of-life research, aiming to show that the transition from chemistry to metabolism is as inevitable as a ball rolling down a slope. Molecules on the early earth, he suggests, inevitably began to catalyze themselves in self-sustaining reactions ("autocatalytic networks"), converting energy and raw materials into increasingly complex structures that eventually crossed the boundary between nonliving and living.

>Other biologists are proposing laws that would explain evolutionary ascent in fundamental terms. Daniel McShea and Robert Brandon, a biologist and a philosopher of science, respectively, at Duke University, have argued for what they call a "zero-force evolutionary law," which posits that diversity and complexity will necessarily increase even without environmental change. The chemist Addy Pross, at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in Israel, argues that life exhibits "dynamic kinetic stability," in which self-replicating systems become more stable through becoming more complex—and are therefore inherently driven to do so.

>Still other scientists have asked how we could measure increases in complexity without being biased by our human-centric perspective. Robert Hazen, working with the Nobel Prize winner Jack Szostak, has proposed a metric he calls "functional information," which measures the number of functions and relationships an organism has relative to its environment. The Harvard astrophysicist Eric Chaisson has proposed measuring a quantity that he calls "energy-rate density": how much energy flows through one gram of a system per second. He argues that when he plots energy-rate density against the emergence of new species, the clear result is an overall increase in complexity over time.


>But Nagel's goal was valid: to point out that fundamental questions of origins, evolution, and intelligence remain unanswered, and to question whether current ways of thinking are up to the task. A really good book on this subject would need to be both scientific and philosophical: scientific to show what is known, philosophical to show how to go beyond what is known. (A better term might be "metascientific," that is, talking about the science and about how to make new sciences.)
>The pieces of this book are scattered about the landscape, in a thousand scraps of ideas from biologists, physicists, physicians, chemists, mathematicians, journalists, public intellectuals, and philosophers. But no book has yet emerged that is mighty enough to shove aside the current order, persuading scientists and nonscientists alike, sparking new experiments, changing syllabi, rejiggering budget priorities, spawning new departments, and changing human language and ways of thought forever. On the Origin of Species did it in 1859. We await the next Darwin.

## More details of the argument

'Human beings are rational animals' is a generic. It is also evaluative/normative. An *irrational* human is ipso facto defective. To call a human 'defective' sounds like a schoolyard insult; but it is a straightforward, evaluative description of some people. I do not here intend to discuss mental illness, disability, birth defect, chromosonal disorders, and other such exceptions to 'normal' functional humans. 

Can we get from such vague statements to particular moral statements? 'Human beings make and keep promises.' Perhaps. Here is one way such a connection might work. 

From 'human beings are rational animals' we can derive 'human beings are language users' by the major premise that 'rational animals are language users.' This major premise is, I think, eminently plausible. One of the identifiers of rationality of other animals (dolphins, great apes) is simply the presence of language. Language is, I presume, a system of signs; if a crow or even an insect such as a bee can be shown to be using signs, many would conclude that ipso facto those creatures would be rational in some sense. Regardless, the question of whether any other animals besides us are rational is identical to the question of whether any other animal uses language the way we do. 

So what does it mean to be a language user? One of the things language can do is refer to events not yet happened, or events no longer happening. To express intentions to do X or not Y in the future requires language. There is some connection here, perhaps not enough, but some connection between language use and promise keeping. A kind of necessity. 

Ignorance is not good for human beings. 'Rational animals seek knowledge when they have plenty of food, water, and shelter.' is perhaps another safe generic. One might say I am trying to express "the value of knowledge" or some such fluffy phrase, but I am not doing any such thing. I am trying to articulate a true, scientific generic about human beings as they are. Certainly, it is a normative statement; but so is 'lizards seek warm rocks at night time.' One can disagree with the truth value of a statement like 'rational animals seek knowledge' but one cannot throw out the whole category of such statements without also denying my starting premise, that all such scientific statements are systematically false. 

Explorations of 'what rationality *is*' are bound to be controversial. I do not want to develop a fully formed theory of rationality here. I only want to articulate a few possible specific examples of generic statements that (in my terms) are evaluative truths true in virtue of our species, that (in my opponents terms) do double duty as scientific descriptions and "moral" norms. These examples are needed to give some flesh and bones to my primary contention, that there exist *at least some* true scientific evaluative statements about humans. 

One more will suffice here. 'Rational beings seek the good.' I don't mean that we always seek what is *actually* good; a jihadist is seeking a great evil which they have mistaken for a good. Nor does it mean that we *actually* seek what is good; an immoderate, overweight, diabetic person may quite intentionally overeat, knowing how unhealthy it is. A habitually foolish person may spend all her money every time she receives a paycheck, even though she knows she will never be able comfortably to retire. Rational beings seek the good. 


## An initial endgame 

Let's review. Generics are normative/descriptive statements that pick out what is formally true of a species. They are a huge percentage of scientific conclusions derived from observation (both unstructured and experimental observation) and from rational reflection upon such observations. 

I have attempted to find in generics some hope for a naturalistic morality. A statement like 'human beings are rational animals' are both descriptive and normative. They (attempt to) describe human nature as a species rather than merely to observe highly contextualized statistical regularities, such as 'human beings wear jeans and t-shirts'. As such, generics (promise to) overcome the much-touted and much fear fact/value split. Generics render moot Moore's so-called 'naturalistic fallacy.' Generics, being is/ought statements, underwrite 'ought' conclusions with the addition of an 'is' premise: Human beings seek knowledge (that is, human beings do seek it and ought to seek it). Bob is a human being. Bob ought to seek knowledge. 

All I have tried to prove is that *some* of these generics are true. I have not tried to prove finally which ones are true. I chose some examples that I think are true and that I rather hope are not too far-fetched for most of my audience. These examples, though, are illustrative not argumentative. In the next chapter, I shall do a good deal more to try to establish specific propositions that some might describe as "moral precepts" but which I shall describe simply as generic facts about human nature. But for now, I welcome disagreement as to the content of the generics.  

To those who disagree about the *nature* of generics. I have tried to urge them to feel free to do so, but to count the cost. The great cost of throwing out generics *as a class* threatens to throw out a huge percentage of scientific statements in biology, organic chemistry, anthropology, psychology, sociology, economics, anatomy, and medicine. 

## McDowell's Worry about the Given


### The worry 
My argument thus far runs afoul of several objections. The most penetrating is John McDowell. His worry is that by deriving moral or more broadly normative conclusions from "scientific" premises assumes a "given". The problem with assuming a Given is that the Given is a myth. That is, McDowell is an idealist *of a sort* -- even our experiences are colored, structured, or otherwise affected by our own powers of perception and reflection. 

Earlier I caricatured scientific knowledge as observing stuff and reflecting upon it to derive scientific conclusions. McDowell would respond that even our "spontaneous" reflective powers are already embroiled in our empirical observations. 

### The response
What are we to say to McDowell? In one sense, I have already said it. McDowell rejects "the Given" in all its forms. Hence he is not a scientific realist. He does not think it true that penguins are birds in the sense that a 'truth' is both the mind-independent reality and the content of a thought that corresponds to reality. He does not think that penguins being birds is a fact about the world as such. Of course, penguins being *classified* as birds is not a fact about the world as such; classification is something (human) scientists do. But he does not think there is a *structure* to the world such that all birds have real properties in common. 

If this is true, he rejects my initial premise: he denies that "some of our scientific conclusions derived upon reflection and observation are true." And my audience cannot follow McDowell there. 

Nevertheless, I think it worthwhile to respond to McDowell and will do so.
