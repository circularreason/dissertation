# Dissertation

A version control and backup repository for my dissertation, which I am writing in Markdown with Sublime Text 3. Everything is copyrighted until further notice. 

## How to write a dissertation

Writing a dissertation can be enjoyable. Brian Tracy says you eat an elephent one bite at a time. Start early, work steadily, do small bits at a time, and take breaks.  

You can read the story of how I approached this massive project [here.](http://keithbuhler.com/phd-how-to) Briefly, I began graduate school in 2012. Began a series of increasingly detailed proposals in 2014. Received approval for the dissertation proposal in 2015. Been writing since then. 

## Writing Tools

I began writing in Word, then in Scrivener, then in Sublime Text 3. I learned Markdown over the winter of 2015 and began writing all my papers and notes in Markdown. I coded some very simple PHP to change the color scheme and learned how to use Pandoc-citeproc to embed "citekeys" which are converted to lovely footnotes when exported. The manuscript is therefore mostly plain text with Markdown tags and citekeys. The "front matter" required a bit of Latex, which took about 3 hours to Google, copy/paste, customize, test, and troubleshoot. It's now done and pretty nearly perfect. 

I went ahead and created a repo for the [Dissertation Template.](https://github.com/keithbuhler/Template-for-philosophy-dissertations)
