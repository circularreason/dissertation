## How to write a dissertation

Writing a dissertation can be enjoyable. Brian Tracy says you eat an elephent one bite at a time. Start early, work steadily, do small bits at a time, and take breaks.  

You can read the story of how I approached this massive project [here.](http://keithbuhler.com/phd-how-to) Briefly, I began graduate school in 2012. Began a series of increasingly detailed proposals in 2014. Received approval for the dissertation proposal in 2015. Been writing since then. 

## Writing Tools

I began writing in Word, then in Scrivener, then in Sublime Text 3. I learned Markdown over the winter of 2015 and began writing all my papers and notes in Markdown. I coded some very simple PHP to change the color scheme and learned how to use Pandoc-citeproc to embed "citekeys" which are converted to lovely footnotes when exported. The manuscript is therefore mostly plain text with Markdown tags and citekeys. The "front matter" required a bit of Latex, which took about 3 hours to Google, copy/paste, customize, test, and troubleshoot. It's now done and pretty nearly perfect. 

I went ahead and created a repo for the [Dissertation Template.](https://github.com/keithbuhler/Template-for-philosophy-dissertations)

## Title (draft) 

My dissertation is tentatively titled: THE VIRTUE TRIANGLE: PRACTICAL REASON, EXCELLENCE, AND NATURAL TELEOLOGY IN THE RECENT NEO-ARISTOTELIANS.

## Abstract (draft)

Recent virtue ethicists such as Philippa Foot and John McDowell, Rosalind Hursthouse, and Alasdair MacIntyre are united on several beliefs: the good person is the virtuous person; virtues are human goods; and human goods are in some way “natural”. They are divided on other questions: is virtue “natural” to humans because humans are rational animals, distinct from others in the animal kingdom or because humans are organisms, fundamentally continuous with all others in the evolutionary tree of life?

Foot emphasizes the natural, biological aspect of virtue ethics (where virtues and vices are “natural goodness” and natural “defect”); John McDowell emphasizes the normative, rational aspect, where virtues are intersubjective, cultural forms of knowledge. Each has its advantages and drawbacks. Biological naturalism blocks cultural relativism but seems to require teleological realism. “Second nature” naturalism seems more aligned to the scientific view of nature but makes it difficult to explain how to criticize injustice in other cultures and how make social progress within one’s own.

Recent neo-Aristotelians have run aground of this difficult matter because, as Julia Annas explains, it reflects a broader perennial question about the relationship between normativity and nature, or between ethics and science. Humans exhibit normal biological processes as well as abstract and practical reasoning. So more generally, how are we to understand the relationship between rationality and biology?

My dissertation systematically analyzes a set of related concepts: nature, virtue, practical reason, and teleology. I discuss the arguments of several recent neo-Aristotelian writers and offer a novel account of how these concepts fit together. I bolster the argument that virtues are human goods pertaining to our nature as practical, rational primates. Even within the confines of scientific naturalism and agnosticism, I give reasons to believe that Foot is right, contra McDowell, that scientific realists should (probably) also be teleological realists.

In brief, I argue that virtue is the excellence of rational practices and practical reasoning that enables and partly constitutes the realization of one’s human life form. I defend a conception of virtue according to which virtuous traits are rational practices and emotions, and practical reasoning is the process of identifying the good. On this view of virtue, the definitive criterion by which to judge human beings is our success or failure in acquiring virtues such as moderation and tolerance, and our overall success in the pursuit of the good life for humans. I also provide an outline of a secular, humanistic conception of flourishing according to which becoming wise is the natural telos of practical rational animals, even though they may individually die and (one day) go extinct.
