# Foot: Virtue as Natural Goodness

## What is virtue?

Foot's account of virtue unfolds across five points: Virtue is

- beneficial, to self and others, while vice is bad for people.
- distinct from skills, fromm strengh, keen eyesight, reliable memory, etc. because these do not involve the will. 
- corrective of some tempting vice.
- only operative toward good ends. 
- natural goodness.


She begins with necessary conditions: A virtue is beneficial.[^10] She says, “Human beings do not get on well without them. Nobody can get on well if he lacks courage, and does not have some measure of temperance and wisdom, while communities where justice and charity re lacking are apt to be wretched places to live, as Russia was under the Stalinist terror.”[@foot2002virtues 2-3] But whom is benefited? Does a person possessing a virtue benefit the virtuous person or the society in which the virtuous person lives? For some virtues, the answer is more clearly “both”: temperance benefits oneself and one’s family or community. For other virtues, such as justice or charity, the answer is less clear. She says, “It is a reasonable opinion that on the whole a man is better off for being charitable and just, but this is not to say that circumstances may not arise in which he will have to sacrifice everything for charity or justice.”[@foot2002virtues 3] The cases in which virtuous deeds necessitate the loss of other goods are not so devestating as they might appear; if on occasion it is better (say) for my family that I sacrifice my health in working hard to earn wages,

The alternative to allowing that virtues are necessarily beneficial even if they are not necessarily beneficial to the possessor in every respect is to believe that every quality may be good or bad. Some qualities (say persistance) certainly do seem to be good or bad depending on other factors. But to deny that some qualities (kindness, cruelty) are really good and really bad is absurd. Furthermore, the assumed metaphysical disparity between my good and my neighbor's good is one of the sacred cows of modern ethical philoosophy we must question.

[^10]: She recommends examining Aristotle and Aquinas (and others) for their view on virtue, but cautions against terminological misunderstandings. *Arete* for them refers “also to arts, and even to excellences of the speculative intellect whose domain is theory rather than practice” (@foot2002virtues 2). *Arete ethikai* (or virtues morales) do not correspond to our moral virtues. For us, there are four moral virtues: courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice. For them, wisdom or *phronesis/prudentia* is an intellectual virtue.] 


> Let us say then, leaving unsolved problems behind us, that virtues are in general beneficial characteristics, and indeed ones that a human being needs to have, for his own sake and that of his fellows. This will not, however, take us far towards a definition of a virtue, since there are many other qualities of a man that may be similarly beneficial, as for instance bodily characteristics such as health and physical strength, and mental powers such as those of memory and concentration.[@foot2002virtues 4]


### Strength
So, what differentiates virtue from strength? At first glance, the answer seems to be something about the will; Foot thinks virtues are revealed not only by a person’s abilities but by his or her *intentions.* But what are intentions? Foot argues that the ‘will’ must be understood in its broadest sense, “to cover what is wished for as well as what is sought.”[@foot2002virtues 5] Intentions are not the *only* thing we judge, for a well-intentioned nincompoop who always harms when helping is rightly judged as deficient in virtue. Neither do we only judge the result of a person's action, for we sometimes exculpate a failing performance in part because the person *meant well*, though it also perhaps it the exculpation is called for because circumstances were not favorable, chances of success were low, etc. 

Foot attempts to capture the point that 

>In his novel A Single Pebble John Hersey describes such a man, speaking of a rescue in a swift flowing river:
>It was the head tracker's marvellous swift response that captured my admiration at first, his split second solicitousness when he heard a cry of pain, his finding in mid‐air, as it were, the only way to save the injured boy. But there was more to it than that. His action, which could not have been mulled over in his mind, showed a deep, (p.5) instinctive love of life, a compassion, an optimism, which made me feel very good . . .
>What this suggests is that a man's virtue may be judged by his innermost desires as well as by his intentions; and this fits with our idea that a virtue such as generosity lies as much in someone's attitudes as in his actions. Pleasure in the good fortune of others is, one thinks, the sign of a generous spirit; and small reactions of pleasure and displeasure often the surest signs of a man's moral disposition.[@foot2002virtues 5]


### Skill
What differentiates virtues from skills? Foot presents the puzzling thought that "in the matter of arts and skills... voluntary error is preferable to involuntary error, while in the matter of virtues... it is the reverse."[@foot2002virtues 7] The thought seems to be that deliberately erring in an art or skill is compatible with mastery, whereas deliberately erring in morality is still an error. 


#### Section II of Foot ####

Foot also argues that virtues are "corrective". That is, each one stands "at a point at which there is some temptation to be resisted or deficiency of motivation to be made good."[@foot2002virtues 8] In this discussion, she is illuminating a statement of Aristotle that "virtues are about what is difficult for men" and also objecting to a statement of Kant that *only* "actions done out of a sense of duty" have moral worth. Kant's happy philanthropist gets great pleasure out of helping others. Kant's dissonant conclusion is that such actions display no moral worth. 

Kant's error, according to Foot, is in failing to distinguish that which is "in accord" with virtue from that which is *virtuous* full stop. It may be, for example, that a novice tennis player makes an expert shot while remaining merely a novice. The hit is in accord with excellence but is not, in this case, an instance of excellence -- only beginner's luck. In her self-love example, Foot points out that there is no virtue required to eat one's breakfast and avoid danger, but there may sometimes be cases where self-love is a duty -- even a difficult, painful duty. She says, "sometimes it is what is owed to others that should keep a man from destroying himself, and then he may act out of a sense of duty."[@foot2002virtues 13] 

So the solution to the happy philanthropist problem is that if he really does have such a character as to be delighted helping others, he is morally praiseworthy *because he has worked to achieve that character*.  

She says: 

>For charity is, as we said, a virtue of attachment as well as action, and the sympathy that makes it easier to act with charity is part of the virtue. The man who acts charitably out of a sense of duty is not to be undervalued, but it is the other who most shows virtue and therefore to the other that most moral worth is attributed.[foot2002virtues 14]

Since charity is a "virtue of attachment" (I should say "affection"), the feelings of the philanthropist count in favor of proving the presence of a virtue. 

Of course, Foot allows that it may take greater virtue for a man to *persist* in his philanthropy *even when* it brings him no delight. 

>Only a detail of Kant's presentation of the case of the dutiful philanthropist tells on the other side. For what he actually said was that this man felt no sympathy and took no pleasure in the good of others because ‘his mind was clouded by some sorrow of his own’, and this is the kind of circumstance that increases the virtue that is needed if a man is to act well.

So virtues are indeed corrective of tempting vices and tempting moral errors. However, the presence of temptation is not a necessary condition for the presence of a virtue. 

#### Section III of Foot ####
Can virtue enable the more efficient achivement of ignoble aims? On the one hand, examples are easy to furnish: a murderer displays courage; a prude displays temperence. It seems commonsensical that whatever attributes we designate as courageous can be found in agents pursuing bad ends. On the other hand, the Aristotelian line excludes such a possibility by definition. Jonathan Sanford's recent monograph, *Before Virtue*, argues that Aristotle's doctrine is "ethics insists it is impossible to exercise any virtue, with the exception of technical skill, wrongly."[@sanford2015before 163] Foot attempts to do justice to both these concerns. The analogy is to poisons or solvents: 

>It is quite natural to say on occasion ‘P does not act as a poison here’ though P is a poison and it is P that is acting here. Similarly courage is not operating as a virtue when the murderer turns his courage, which is a virtue, to bad ends. Not surprisingly the resistance that some of us registered was not to the expression ‘the courage of the murderer’ or to the assertion that what he did ‘took courage’ but rather to the description of that action as an act of courage or a courageous act. It is not that the action could not be so described, but that the fact that courage does not here have its characteristic operation is a reason for finding the description strange.[@foot2002virtues 16]

An agent's commission of an otherwise virtuous action may be a mistake *for that agent* at that time. This may seem ad hoc, but we must remember that Foot is attempting to make space for the "commonsense" observation that some good traits operate to bad ends *within* the philosophically rigorous definition of virtue as beneficial. 

One objection Foot responds to is the worry some might have that she is saying *only* those who are completely virtuous are virtuous at all. She has two responses: wisdom always operates as a virtue. So we admire wisdom perhaps most of all. I would add that when we admire another virtue such as courage, or justice, or moderation, we are often admiring the *wisdom in* the courage, the justice, and the moderation. 

A second response, though, is that we do admire some who have only a subset of all the virtues: 

>There are some people who do possess all these virtues and who are loved and admired by all the world, as Pope John XXIII was loved and admired. Yet the fact is that many of us look up to some people whose chaotic lives contain rather little of wisdom or temperance, rather than to some others who possess these virtues. And while it may be that this is just romantic nonsense I suspect that it is not.[@foot2002virtues 17]

Even those whose overall life is a mish-mash of virtues and vices are admirable. My interpretation of this sentiment is that such are admirable insofar as they demonstrate some excellent qualities. 

## Natural Goodness ##

Foot argues that virtues are instances of 'natural goodness.' This is a powerful thesis that she defends at length in her 2001 monograph.[@foot2001natural] I would like to hazard a summary of the dialectic before offering responses. 

Foot is aware that her offering in *Natural Goodness* is "crude" in that she is aware it will offend the ears of some listeners. Her defense is the thought from Wittgenstein that often crude beginnings are a necessary start to something refined. 


### Re-thinking the fact/value split
She calls the inquiry a "fresh start." By this she means to do without several shaky assumptions of Moore and Hume. For example, Moore assumed that "good" was the ultimate predicate under review in ethics; but this is false. Statements like "pleasure is good" are not good paradigms for philosophical reflection. 

Contrast 'good' with other predicates like 'red' or 'beautiful.' In a statement such as 'the house is beautiful', the predicate 'beautiful' doesn't need a complement. The house is *beautiful* -- full stop. But 'good' (like 'useful') has a different logical function. 'The house is useful' does need a complement -- the house is useful *for a mom of six, or useful for an artist,* or what have you.  Similarly, 'good' always means *good for someone* or *for something.* 'Good' always needs a complement. 


### On practical rationality ###

Another false assumption "finds its deepest roots in David Hume..."[@footnatural 6] It is the premise of almost all non-cognitivist thinkers isa way of dividing facts from values, "that the meaning of moral terms was to be explained in terms of a speaker’s attitude, intentions, or state of mind. And this opened up a gap between moral judgments and assertions... Fact, complementary to assertion, had been distinguished from value, complementary to the expression of feeling, attitude, or commitment to action."[@footnatural 8] There is a real distinction in the offing, but it is not the distinction between facts and values; it is the distinction between practical and theoretical. 

>Their theories were devised to take account of something that really is a feature of moral judgment: the ‘action-guiding’ character of morality, which Hume had insisted on and taken as the foundation of his moral philosophy. Morality, Hume had said, is necessarily practical, serving to produce and prevent action, and I shall call this ‘Hume’s practicality requirement.’ Emotivism satisfies the requirement in the wrong way. (9). 

We might say some facts are "actionable", while others are not. That is, some facts are *reasons for action* while others are *reasons for belief*.  We can use different nouns for the same distinction: some values are reasons for action, but some are not. But this is just the age-old distinction between theoretical and practical faculties and between truth and goodness. Truth is that which is to be believed; goodness is that which is to be pursued. 

For example, the greenness of home-grown kale is reason to believe the leaves contain chlorophyll. The healthiness of home-grown kale is a reason to eat it. Some will object that "healthiness" is a value and so proves the point that facts are not values and values not facts. But this is mere circular reasoning. In normal conversation, the term 'healthy' is a straightforward descriptive adjective like 'green'. My dinner guests may dispute my enthusiastic assertion that home-grown kale is tasty, but they do not dispute my describing it as healthy, nor do they misunderstand and confuse my meaning. The doctrine that, despite all appearances to the contrary, evaluative terms "*really*" just express a speaker's subjective values is precisely the doctrine Foot (and I) would like to consign to the defendent's chair. 

To deny that moral judgments are action guiding would be clearly wrong. But she aims to capture this "practicality requirement" in a far different way.
Perhaps it is wrong also to think that only subjective states can be action-guiding; perhaps evaluative properties, too, can be action-guiding. 

### Lifeform specific facts: biology and value

What are the action-guiding facts in the case of natural goodness? Facts about humans and facts about objects in the world and facts about our relation to those objects.

Virtue ethicists like Philippa Foot, and Peter Geach before her, express their thesis in statements like "virtues are necessary for human beings." The kind of necessity invoked here is not a sui generis ethical necessity but an instance of a familiar kind. That is, virtues for humans are like stings for bees, swiftness for deer, solidarity for wolves; there is a fundamental parity between natural goodness in nonhumans and humans. The parity is due to a common (metaphysical) structure shared by all living things as such. When we observe and examine living things we rightly employ some shared categories and our conclusions rightly share a logical structure. 

What is the common structure? Every individual living being is a member of a species or life-form. And different life-forms are subject to different normative appraisals. 

Thompson's groundbreaking *Representation of Life* argues that "life" is a fundamental concept. "Life" is not, as it may seem to some, a property of some beings where being is the fundamental concept. 


Julia Annas says: 
>What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out…[@Annas 1996)(find book)


## 4. Immorality can be answered.

## 5. Virtues benefit their possessor by definition; but they can cause harm and suffering.

## 6. Happiness is deep satisfaction.

## 7. Unhappiness is in some way compatible with virtue. 

## 8. Some object that Foot is not a "naturalist." This is to misunderstand Foot and to beg the question as to what nature is. 

“…we can see that Foot’s naturalism offers a fresh approach to objectivism in ethics. Yet, in spite of such attractions, Natural Goodness is in the midst of a cool reception. Here, I will argue that this reception is due to the fact that Foot’s naturalism draws on a picture of the biological world that is at odds with the view embraced by most contemporary scientists and philosophers. Foot’s readers commonly assume that the account of the biological world that she must want to adhere to, and that she nevertheless mistakenly departs from, is the account offered by contemporary neo-Darwinian biological sciences.”[@hacker2009natural 309]

10. Some object that Foot is unclear across three levels: logic, language, and morality. This is somewhat true but drawing a clear distinction between the three need not suggest a sharp *division* between the three. 
12. Some object that Foot is not clear (James Lenman, for example). This is not true; she is clear enough to expose the readers' modern prejudices. 


>The objection I think I understand and want to take seriously
starts from the thought that in employing such notions as life and organism
and life-form or species we introduce something foreign, in particular
something ‘biological’, or crudely empirical, into the elements of
ethical theory. Any such view, one thinks, must involve either a vulgar
scientistic dissolution of the ethical, tending maybe toward an ‘evolutionary
ethics’, or else the covert substitution of an outdated metaphysics
for what we know to be empirical. Each path leads to its own absurdities.
Together they may be thought to betray a yearning to view our
practices ‘from outside’ or ‘from sideways on’ in hope perhaps of providing
them with a foundation or an external grounding.[@@thompson2008life]
