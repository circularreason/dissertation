#1 Virtues are Excellent Traits Human Beings Need 


## Introduction

Peter Geach says that virtues are necessary for man as stings are necessary for bees.[@geach1977virtues] Philippa Foot echoes these statements about "need" and "necessity" as well. Alasdair MacIntyre subtitled his most recent monograph: "human beings need the virtues."[@macintyre1999dependent] What do statements like this mean? 

First, I would like to examine MacIntyre, Foot, Mcdowell, and Adams on this quesiton. Second, I would like to offer original answers to some remaining puzzles or troubling objections in virtue ethics. 


## MacIntyre: Rational Virtue in Traditions

MacIntyre (born 1929) has exercised wide influence.^[Though he is classified as a "virtue ethicist", MacIntyre rejects the label insofar as it does not necessitate a real restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Nevertheless, he has contributed to virtue ethics, as well as a surprising number of other fields: the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education, sociology, and more.] He argues that the great moral confusion of our time is due, in part, to the fracturing of social and political bonds deriving from a shared understanding of and pursuit of the good. 

### Section Introduction

MacIntyre's concept of virtue is derived from (but not limited to) a careful study of the history of the concept within the broader western tradition.[^3] So we'll begin there. Then we shall see how he expands this definition in light of six supporting concepts: practice, self, telos, practical rationality, and *phronesis* or practical wisdom. Briefly, *practices* are social activities in which virtues are acquired and used; The *self* is what acquires virtues and vices; *telos* is necessary to define the contrast with the way we are now and the way we ought to be if we were fully "realized" or fulfilled as persons; *practical rationality* is the defining feature of humans as dependent animals; similarly, *phronesis* or practical wisdom bears a special relationship to all the other virtues. In sum, this account of virtue and practical rationality powerfully captures the phenomena of human life, and so lends support to MacIntyre’s conviction that humans need the virtues.

[^3]: MacIntyre's philosophical methodology is exemplified in how he defines ‘virtue’. He begins with Homeric virtues (roughly, the performance of one’s social role) and works through the implicit or explicit definitions of virtue in Plato, Aristotle, the Greek tragic poets, the New Testament, Aquinas, Jane Austen, and Benjamin Franklin. While respecting the different definitions and examples, he creatively abstracts an account that unifies them all. His definition is historical but not restricted to history; it aims to be universal but does not pretend to be purely abstract. His concept of virtue is, rather, *traditional*. Furthermore, as we shall see, MacIntyre's view of 'tradition' is not conservative but progressive, not oriented toward the past but the future. 

### Virtue -- an initial definition

MacIntyre's initial definition of virtue is that virtues are “acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191] This is perhaps a puzzling definition. What are "*practices*"? Practice is a key term of art; to misunderstand it would be to misunderstand MacIntyre. Also, he defines virtues with reference to goods *"internal to"* practices. What is the internal/external relation doing? The next section shall explain these term more fully. For now, a few further observations are in order to elucidate each piece of this initial definition.

First, he says virtues are acquired *human* qualities. Presumably, human qualities are opposed to analogous qualities of non-human animals. The flexible flagellum of a bacterium, the swiftness of a deer -- formal or functional biological features that enable an animal to survive and thrive -- are excluded from the class of virtues by definition. MacIntyre's later *Dependent Rational Animals* retracts the assumed divide between human and non-human animals. But here, virtues do not arise from nor depend on biology. In this, MacIntyre's initial formulation disagrees with Foot but agrees with McDowell, as we shall see. The next section will also address the question: What constitutes an individual human self? 

Secondly, virtues are *acquired* human qualities. This is an important point and relates to the first, for natural biological features are inborn. Virtues, rather, are acquired. This is no small matter. In the first line of Plato's *Meno*, Meno asks Socrates a question that moral philosophers have continued to try to answer for the last 2,400 years. He asks "whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?"[@plato, *Meno* 70a] MacIntyre's answer is not that virtue is a gift of the gods, but that it is *acquired.* A recent volume edited by Mark Alfano[@alfano2015current] discusses the range of which positive traits count as virtues. MacIntyre, it would seem, sides with those who limit the range to exclude inborn or genetically determined qualities like a good memory or excellent eyesight from being considered virtues. That is not to say that virtues are *not natural*. In one sense of the word 'natural', virtues are proper to human beings without being, so to speak, "automatic." In this, he agrees with Aristotle that virtue is *in accordance with* nature but not *by nature*.  Rather, virtuous traits are a "normal" psychological outgrowth of cultivating excellence within particular human practices. 

Thirdly, virtues enable their possessor to achieve particular *goods.* This clause assumes that virtues are beneficial. A virtuous trait *cannot* be directed at achieving ills. This assumption will bring some trouble for MacIntyre's initial definition in *After Virtue*. Can't overall wicked people have particular virtues? Can't the thief be courageous, the dictator magnanimous, the glutton affable? It certainly seems that the answer is yes. Even indexing virtues to practices does not solve the problem; can practices be wicked? I shall discuss this problem in next sub-sections.

Fourthly, since virtues "enable their possessor to achieve ... goods", it may seem that virtue are mere *instruments* to goods, not goods themselves. A grave misunderstanding lurks in the vicinity. Virtues *are* instrumental for MacIntyre, but they are not *merely* instrumental. They are both instrumental (to the achievement of certain goods) and also *partly constitutive of those goods.* Virtues are both means to an end and also ends in themselves.^[*Phronesis* or practical wisdom, for example, enables agents to make good decisions that result in human flourishing but having *phronesis* *just is part of what it means* to flourish qua human.] Now, this conflation of means and ends is liable to worry some critics. The worry is not trivial; however, for the sake of completing my presentation of virtue, I must set it aside for now.

With these comments in hand, we can more deeply explore MacIntyre's unfolding account of virtue in the following sub-sections. 

### Practice ###

The first concept we must explain is that of a 'practice.' What is a practice? A practice is a social activity aimed at defined ends. (We commonly speak of "practicing" medicine in this sense.) MacIntyre mentions farming, chess, and political activity, among other examples.  A practice is not merely a reflexive action (like scratching an itch) nor merely a single, discrete, intelligible action (like pulling a weed); it is an intelligible set of actions. The farmer is engaged in a series of activities, from tilling, sowing, watering, protecting, harvesting, storing, etc., all of which are embedded within a social context and organized around a particular goal. Each practice has a history, a set of practitioners, a common set of standards, and a common goal. And virtues are those qualities that enable their possessor to excel in practices. 

For example, secondary school education is a social activity that teachers undertake in order to give children the basic knowledge and skills they need to transition to functional adults in society, whether by getting a job, starting a business, or advancing to higher stages of education.[^5]  Secondary education in the U.S. is a practice with a history (or a set of histories) from the present time back to when Americans completing high school (rather than beginning work on a farm or in town by the age of 16) was the exception rather than the rule. It has standards, both legal standards and "best practices" passed from mentor to student teacher. It pretty obviously has standards of excellence according to which most educators are average, some poor, and some excellent. An educator who wants to join that profession will be enculturated with that history, taught those standards, and given a chance (usually by trial and error) to become a good teacher. 

[^5]: Secondary education has other (perhaps de facto) purposes, like to socialize young people in a community of peers and authorities, and to afford them opportunities for recreation, art, clubs, to give parents a break, and so on. For the sake of simplicity, I shall focus on what seems to me the primary goal of education, which is education (in knowledge) and training (in skills) needed for becoming a legal adult. 

Leading MacIntyre scholar, Christopher Lutz, highlights four aspects of MacIntyre's famous definition of practice. A practice is: 

>[1] a complex social activity that [2] enables participants to gain goods internal to the practice. [3] Participants achieve excellence in practices by gaining the internal goods. When participants achieve excellence, [4] the social understandings of excellence in the practice, of the goods of the practice, and of the possibility of achieving excellence in the practice are systematically extended.[@lutz2015] 

I believe my example of high school education illustrates Lutz' explication of MacIntyre's definition of 'practice.' [1] Practices are inherently complex *social* activities in that teachers cannot be teachers without students, and (usually) do not teach in isolation but in community with colleagues and administrators and parents. [2] Secondary education qua practice enables teachers to gain the goods "internal to the practice", namely students who are educated enough to be ready for legal adulthood -- for a job or college. [3] Good teachers are those that demonstrate the ability reliably to produce, against all odds, educated students. And [4] good schools and good teachers usually have a *history* and social context that is being "extended" across generations. Good schools recruit and train good teachers, good teachers train the next generation of good teachers, and so on. 

What does this phrase "goods internal to the practice" mean? MacIntyre later refashions the contrast between 'internal' and 'external' goods into one between 'goods of excellence' and 'goods of effectiveness.' I prefer the latter terminology. But the point is, I think, clear. The goods of excellence just are those that necessarily contribute to success within a given practice as such. In secondary education, success is defined by graduate rates, student retention of information, high test scores, high acceptance rates to top colleges, low drug use, low teenage pregnancy, and so on. The profession-specific virtues needed include understanding (to stay patient with struggling students), affability (to keep rapport), articulateness (to present material effectively), and so on. More general virtues needed include honesty, integrity, courage, faithfulness, and so on. Without these, *teaching* may be possible but *teaching well* is impossible. 

By contrast, goods of effectiveness are those that might fit with the practice but are not *necessary* for achieving the end of that practice: high pay, an excellent teacher lounge, a short commute to work, and so on. Mere efficiency in attaining such external goods does not entail the presence of a virtue. In fact, the desire to pursue such goods *instead of* the goods of excellence is not a neutral desire — it is a *temptation.* Virtues are needed to overcome those temptations and to succeed according to the standards of the practice itself.[^6]

[^6]: To illustrate the temptation goods of effectiveness might pose, we need only think about political activity. Some (I suppose) become politicians *in order to bring about* the survival, security, and prosperity of the *polis*; others engage in order merely to satisfy their own ambition or achieve fame. Often we see American politicians running for office only one apparent aim: book sales.  

### Further layers

MacIntyre's initial definition, culled from a careful study of history, is that virtues are "acquired human qualities that enable their possessor to achieve those goods which are internal to practices."[@macintyre1984after 191] However, this definition is incomplete. It is only the first of three layers or dimensions of his final account in *After Virtue*. 

The second layer depends on the notions of a complete human life, the sum of all the practices of one’s life. The third layer depends on MacIntyre’s notion of “tradition-constituted rationality.” The this third layer I will address in a later chapter. 




### Some closing thoughts

Virtues are qualities that enable the health and persistence of traditions. A tradition is an extended argument, in part about the goods that constitute that tradition and the terms of that argument. 

Virtues are individual but not individualistic. They are cultural but not culturally relativistic. 

What MacIntyre is missing is a full account of humanity as not just a social being but a biological being. We are animals. We are rational animals but animals just the same. Rationality will be discussed in the next chapter.  

      Transition

## Foot on virtue

How does MacIntyre's account compare to that of Philippa Foot? 

### What is a virtue?

Foot argues that virtue is excellence of the rational will.  Her account of virtue unfolds across five points. Virtue is: beneficial, to self and others, while vice is bad for people; distinct from skills, from strength, keen eyesight, reliable memory, etc. because such excellences are not excellence of will; corrective of some tempting vice; only operative toward good ends; *natural* goodness, in a way that must be further explained. 

She begins with necessary conditions: A virtue is beneficial.[^10] She says, “Human beings do not get on well without them. Nobody can get on well if he lacks courage, and does not have some measure of temperance and wisdom, while communities where justice and charity re lacking are apt to be wretched places to live, as Russia was under the Stalinist terror.”[@foot2002virtues 2-3] But whom is benefited? Does a person possessing a virtue benefit the virtuous person or the society in which the virtuous person lives? For some virtues, the answer is more clearly “both”: temperance benefits oneself and one’s family or community. For other virtues, such as justice or charity, the answer is less clear. She says, “It is a reasonable opinion that on the whole a man is better off for being charitable and just, but this is not to say that circumstances may not arise in which he will have to sacrifice everything for charity or justice.”[@foot2002virtues 3] The cases in which virtuous deeds necessitate the loss of other goods are not so devastating as they might appear; if on occasion it is better (say) for my family that I sacrifice my health in working hard to earn wages,

The alternative to allowing that virtues are necessarily beneficial even if they are not necessarily beneficial to the possessor in every respect is to believe that every quality may be good or bad. Some qualities (say persistence) certainly do seem to be good or bad depending on other factors. But to deny that some qualities (kindness, cruelty) are really good and really bad is absurd. Furthermore, the assumed metaphysical disparity between my good and my neighbor's good is one of the sacred cows of modern ethical philosophy we must question.

[^10]: She recommends examining Aristotle and Aquinas (and others) for their view on virtue, but cautions against terminological misunderstandings. *Arete* for them refers “also to arts, and even to excellences of the speculative intellect whose domain is theory rather than practice” (@foot2002virtues 2). *Arete ethikai* (or virtues morales) do not correspond to our moral virtues. For us, there are four moral virtues: courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice. For them, wisdom or *phronesis/prudentia* is an intellectual virtue.] 

> Let us say then, leaving unsolved problems behind us, that virtues are in general beneficial characteristics, and indeed ones that a human being needs to have, for his own sake and that of his fellows. This will not, however, take us far towards a definition of a virtue, since there are many other qualities of a man that may be similarly beneficial, as for instance bodily characteristics such as health and physical strength, and mental powers such as those of memory and concentration.[@foot2002virtues 4]


### Strength

So, what differentiates virtue from strength? At first glance, the answer seems to be something about the will; Foot thinks virtues are revealed not only by a person’s abilities but by his or her *intentions.* But what are intentions? Foot argues that the ‘will’ must be understood in its broadest sense, “to cover what is wished for as well as what is sought.”[@foot2002virtues 5] Intentions are not the *only* thing we judge, for a well-intentioned nincompoop who always harms when helping is rightly judged as deficient in virtue. Neither do we only judge the result of a person's action, for we sometimes exculpate a failing performance in part because the person *meant well*, though it also perhaps it the exculpation is called for because circumstances were not favorable, chances of success were low, etc. 

Foot attempts to capture the point that 

>In his novel A Single Pebble John Hersey describes such a man, speaking of a rescue in a swift flowing river:
>It was the head tracker's marvelous swift response that captured my admiration at first, his split second solicitousness when he heard a cry of pain, his finding in mid‐air, as it were, the only way to save the injured boy. But there was more to it than that. His action, which could not have been mulled over in his mind, showed a deep, (p.5) instinctive love of life, a compassion, an optimism, which made me feel very good.
>What this suggests is that a man's virtue may be judged by his innermost desires as well as by his intentions; and this fits with our idea that a virtue such as generosity lies as much in someone's attitudes as in his actions. Pleasure in the good fortune of others is, one thinks, the sign of a generous spirit; and small reactions of pleasure and displeasure often the surest signs of a man's moral disposition.[@foot2002virtues 5]


### Skill

What differentiates virtues from skills? Foot presents the puzzling thought that "in the matter of arts and skills... voluntary error is preferable to involuntary error, while in the matter of virtues... it is the reverse."[@foot2002virtues 7] The thought seems to be that deliberately erring in an art or skill is compatible with mastery, whereas deliberately erring in morality is still an error. 

Julia Annas will challenge the truism that virtues are distinct from skills. She offers an argument that virtues are skills of a particular type.[@annas2011intelligent] 

I think the worry here is that we don't want to call skills morally valuable when they do not seem to have any moral import. Is a contracter who excels at hammering 16d nails into wooden frames to be admired for his *virtue*? Is the quarterback who can make accurate throws under pressure virtuous? This seems to us moderns to smack too much of the "Homeric" sense of virtue as *any* admirable quality. 

I shall respond to this complaint if time permits. 

#### Virtues are Corrective ####

Foot also argues that virtues are "corrective". That is, each one stands "at a point at which there is some temptation to be resisted or deficiency of motivation to be made good."[@foot2002virtues 8] In this discussion, she is illuminating a statement of Aristotle that "virtues are about what is difficult for men" and also objecting to a statement of Kant that *only* "actions done out of a sense of duty" have moral worth. Kant's happy philanthropist gets great pleasure out of helping others. Kant's dissonant conclusion is that such actions display no moral worth. 

Kant's error, according to Foot, is in failing to distinguish that which is "in accord" with virtue from that which is *virtuous* full stop. It may be, for example, that a novice tennis player makes an expert shot while remaining merely a novice. The hit is in accord with excellence but is not, in this case, an instance of excellence -- only beginner's luck. In her self-love example, Foot points out that there is no virtue required to eat one's breakfast and avoid danger, but there may sometimes be cases where self-love is a duty -- even a difficult, painful duty. She says, "sometimes it is what is owed to others that should keep a man from destroying himself, and then he may act out of a sense of duty."[@foot2002virtues 13] 

So the solution to the happy philanthropist problem is that if he really does have such a character as to be delighted helping others, he is morally praiseworthy *because he has worked to achieve that character*.  

She says: 

>For charity is, as we said, a virtue of attachment as well as action, and the sympathy that makes it easier to act with charity is part of the virtue. The man who acts charitably out of a sense of duty is not to be undervalued, but it is the other who most shows virtue and therefore to the other that most moral worth is attributed.[foot2002virtues 14]

Since charity is a "virtue of attachment" (I should say "affection"), the feelings of the philanthropist count in favor of proving the presence of a virtue. 

Of course, Foot allows that it may take greater virtue for a man to *persist* in his philanthropy *even when* it brings him no delight. 

>Only a detail of Kant's presentation of the case of the dutiful philanthropist tells on the other side. For what he actually said was that this man felt no sympathy and took no pleasure in the good of others because ‘his mind was clouded by some sorrow of his own’, and this is the kind of circumstance that increases the virtue that is needed if a man is to act well.

So virtues are indeed corrective of tempting vices and tempting moral errors. However, the presence of temptation is not a necessary condition for the presence of a virtue. 

#### Virtues benefit their possessor ####

Can virtue enable the more efficient achievement of ignoble aims? On the one hand, examples are easy to furnish: a murderer displays courage; a prude displays temperance. It seems commonsensical that whatever attributes we designate as courageous can be found in agents pursuing bad ends. On the other hand, the Aristotelian line excludes such a possibility by definition. Jonathan Sanford's recent monograph, *Before Virtue*, argues that Aristotle's doctrine is "ethics insists it is impossible to exercise any virtue, with the exception of technical skill, wrongly."[@sanford2015before 163] Foot attempts to do justice to both these concerns. The analogy is to poisons or solvents: 

>It is quite natural to say on occasion ‘P does not act as a poison here’ though P is a poison and it is P that is acting here. Similarly courage is not operating as a virtue when the murderer turns his courage, which is a virtue, to bad ends. Not surprisingly the resistance that some of us registered was not to the expression ‘the courage of the murderer’ or to the assertion that what he did ‘took courage’ but rather to the description of that action as an act of courage or a courageous act. It is not that the action could not be so described, but that the fact that courage does not here have its characteristic operation is a reason for finding the description strange.[@foot2002virtues 16]

An agent's commission of an otherwise virtuous action may be a mistake *for that agent* at that time. This may seem ad hoc, but we must remember that Foot is attempting to make space for the "commonsense" observation that some good traits operate to bad ends *within* the philosophically rigorous definition of virtue as beneficial. 

One objection Foot responds to is the worry some might have that she is saying *only* those who are completely virtuous are virtuous at all. She has two responses: wisdom always operates as a virtue. So we admire wisdom perhaps most of all. I would add that when we admire another virtue such as courage, or justice, or moderation, we are often admiring the *wisdom in* the courage, the justice, and the moderation. 

A second response, though, is that we do admire some who have only a subset of all the virtues: 

>There are some people who do possess all these virtues and who are loved and admired by all the world, as Pope John XXIII was loved and admired. Yet the fact is that many of us look up to some people whose chaotic lives contain rather little of wisdom or temperance, rather than to some others who possess these virtues. And while it may be that this is just romantic nonsense I suspect that it is not.[@foot2002virtues 17]

Even those whose overall life is a mishmash of virtues and vices are admirable. My interpretation of this sentiment is that such are admirable insofar as they demonstrate some excellent qualities. 


### Natural Goodness ###

Foot pays strict attention to our status as natural entities. Evaluation of human creatures follows the same logical pattern as evolution of plants and animals. ‘Good’ as a predicate is not used without complement (‘the house is good’) the way other predicates like ‘beautiful’ is used (‘the house is beautiful’ ). ‘Good’ as a predicate is used with a complement (‘the house is good for single mothers’) the same way other terms are, such as ’useful’. Good is good *for*. 


Foot argues that virtues are instances of 'natural goodness.' This is a powerful thesis that she defends at length in her 2001 monograph.[@foot2001natural] I would like to hazard a summary of the dialectic before offering responses. 

Foot is aware that her offering in *Natural Goodness* is "crude" in that she is aware it will offend the ears of some listeners. Her defense is the thought from Wittgenstein that often crude beginnings are a necessary start to something refined. 


### Re-thinking the fact/value split

She calls the inquiry a "fresh start." By this she means to do without several shaky assumptions of Moore and Hume. For example, Moore assumed that "good" was the ultimate predicate under review in ethics; but this is false. Statements like "pleasure is good" are not good paradigms for philosophical reflection. 

Contrast 'good' with other predicates like 'red' or 'beautiful.' In a statement such as 'the house is beautiful', the predicate 'beautiful' doesn't need a complement. The house is *beautiful* -- full stop. But 'good' (like 'useful') has a different logical function. 'The house is useful' does need a complement -- the house is useful *for a mom of six, or useful for an artist,* or what have you.  Similarly, 'good' always means *good for someone* or *for something.* 'Good' always needs a complement. 


### Life-form specific facts: biology and value

What are the action-guiding facts in the case of natural goodness? Facts about humans and facts about objects in the world and facts about our relation to those objects.

Virtue ethicists like Philippa Foot, and Peter Geach before her, express their thesis in statements like "virtues are necessary for human beings." The kind of necessity invoked here is not a sui generis ethical necessity but an instance of a familiar kind. That is, virtues for humans are like stings for bees, swiftness for deer, solidarity for wolves; there is a fundamental parity between natural goodness in nonhumans and humans. The parity is due to a common (metaphysical) structure shared by all living things as such. When we observe and examine living things we rightly employ some shared categories and our conclusions rightly share a logical structure. 

What is the common structure? Every individual living being is a member of a species or life-form. And different life-forms are subject to different normative appraisals. 

Thompson's groundbreaking *Representation of Life* argues that "life" is a fundamental concept. "Life" is not, as it may seem to some, a property of some beings where being is the fundamental concept. 


Julia Annas says: 
>What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out…[@@annas2005virtue]








## McDowell on virtue

### Introduction

### McDowell, virtue as knowledge


McDowell's theses are: 

1. "The point of engaging in ethical reflection... lies in the interest of the question "How should one live?"[@mcdowell1979virtue 331]

2. Virtues are kinds of knowledge; virtue is a kind of knowledge. 

McDowell argues that virtue is at least partially a kind of knowledge. For although morality is *practical knowledge* (a “disposition to act well"), yet it seems to demand "a moral outlook" to act well.[@mcdowell1979virtue 331] Suppose that some platitudinous value (say, kindness) is really a virtue. The kind person is kind *on purpose*, is kind reliably. A person who merely happens to be kind or who commits acts of kindness resulting from blind instinct does not seem to merit the ascription of a virtue. A person who is kind once, or even every now and then, likewise does not seem to merit the ascription of a virtue. Rather, a kind person is one who is regualary sensitive to a range of reasons for behaving in a particular way. The kind person, McDowell adduces, "has a reliable sensitivity to a certain sort of requirement which situations impose on behavior" and such "deliverances of a reliable sensitivity are cases of knowledge."[@mcdowell1979virtue 332] The kind person *knows* what is called for, is intentional about avoiding cruel or indifferent behavior, and so on. 

These reflections support the notion that this kind of knowledge ("sensitivity to reasons") is necessary for the virtue but not sufficient. 


3. The question of how to live must be approached from "within" a moral outlook and approached "*via* the notion of a virtuous person"[@mcdowell1979virtue 331] 


McDowell aims to prove that virtues are ethical qualities that only make sense ‘from within’, that they lend a certain kind of perceptive ability to their bearers. 

His main opponent is the notion that morality can be adduced from an objective third-person sort of view. This objection bases itself on the analogy to deductive reasoning, which follows strict rules and succeeds on the basis of allegedly objective rules “out there” for us to discover and follow. 

His rebuttal is to deny that deductive reasoning is so objective. Rather, deductive reasoning is not rule-following, except in that we follow a vague collection of rules associated by our common forms of life. We only know deduction, too, from within. So moral reasoning, he avers, we also know from within, by doing it, while doing it, because of our common forms of life. He does not much advance a view of virtue beyond the Aristotelian notion that virtues are qualities of reliable good-choosing, good-acting.
























## Adams

Adams’ account of virtue is that it is “excellence in being for the good.” The fundamental orientation of “being for” the good is crucial to his account. One can fail in important ways in achieving the good; but such failing is morally superior to vice, which is failing even to be for the good. 

The good is not merely moral. Adams allows that virtue can include excellence in being for goods like aesthetic beauty, mathematical or philosophical truth, and benevolence towards one’s fellow man. 


## My Views

1. What is virtue? Although it seems a virtue is an analytically defined 'good trait', it is a synthetically discovered excellent trait we all need. 
2. What is excellence? Although it seems excellence is... 
3. What are the virtues? Although it seems there is one virtue or unlimited virtues, there is a limited set: justice, courage, moderation, practical wisdom and perhaps more.
4. Are the virtues human or cultural? Although it seems they are cultural, they are 'human traits' in that they express human nature. MacIntyre does not basis virtue enough in metaphysical biology; Foot bases it too much in metaphysical biology; McDowell bases virtue in reason but does not explain the relation of reason to metaphysical biology. Foot is closest to my view, but I supplement her view with arguments to the effect that normativity (including teleology) is built-in to nature as a whole, not just humanity. 
5. Why is it "necessary" to be virtuous? Although it seems that virtues are optional,  they partly constitute human flourishing, which everyone ought to want, while the vices partly constitute misery, which everyone ought to avoid.  It is necessary because it is human. Justice, prudence, and courage are "needed in any human-scale enterprise"[@geach ], from motherhood, to a successful career, to farming. Put negatively, the thesis of this chapter is that vices necessarily contribute to misery, unhappiness, and human stultification and stagnation. Human nature is the starting point, flourishing is the goal, and the moral and intellectual virtues are the means by which we move from start to goal. 
6. What is human flourishing? Although it seems to be merely pleasure or worldly success, and though I shall define it more later, I mean generally "well-being", tru ehappiness, human success as such.  
7. Supposing that virtues *benefit their possessor*, is it then egoistic or selfish to pursue virtue? Although it seems we only need virtue if we want to be happy, everyone has an obligation to develop virtuous traits because virtues help us become who we are. Such a pursuit is not selfish in the pejorative sense of the word; it is not 'egoism' for the charge of egoism assumes that the good for men is not *the good* per se. 
8. Can the virtuous person be irrational? 
9. Can virtues be put to bad use? 
10. Are virtues acquirable only or innate? 

This chapter will provide an primary ethical answers to these questions.  Later chapters will elaborate on key terms within this thesis or address objections to thesis. 



## 1. What is virtue? Although it seems a virtue is an analytically defined 'good trait', it is a synthetically discovered excellent trait we all need. 



## 2. What is excellence? Although it seems excellence is... 

### What is excellence?



What is ‘excellence’? Anything with a function can perform its function, fail to perform it, or perform it well. Excellence is performing a function well. A knife cuts; a knife that cuts well is excellent. Of course, a real example needs more detail; a particular kind of knife that both cuts well and is durable must be of a particular length, type of metal, have a particular handle, and so on. But human beings need to live and make decisions; we are animals in our need to breathe, eat, sleep, and stay warm, deal with the urgings of our sexual nature, and so on. We are rational animals in our need to plan, think, deliberate, reflect, assume identities, pursue projects, and so on. Though it is very arguable whether humans as such even have a function, and if so, whether it is one definite function or a range of various functions or an unlimited set, it is undeniable that we *act* and we *act for an end*. So the qualities that enable us to pursue our ends *well* would be excellent qualities. The practical, rational agents who consistently succeed at pursuing and achieving their ends would be models of virtue.  I shall have much more to say below about what ends people *have* or *ought to have* and about the indeterminate concept of human flourishing or happiness. 


Virtue is an excellence, but it is an excellence *of* something, namely human nature. I fulfill the difficult task of exploring human nature in the following chapter. For now, I need to show that humans need virtues because they are necessary for distinctly human life. 


## 3. What are the virtues? Although it seems there is one virtue or unlimited virtues, there is a limited set: justice, courage, moderation, practical wisdom and perhaps more.

### What are the virtues? 

What are the virtues? The ‘cardinal’ or classical virtues to which tradition gives preeminent place are courage, justice, moderation, and practical wisdom. (I shall have more to say about the contours of each virtue in the discussions below. But, roughly, justice is giving to each his due; courage is the proper boldness in doing the right thing despite opposition; moderation is pursuing pleasure in the right way at the right time; practical wisdom is excellence in knowing what to do in a given situation.)


## 4. Are the virtues human or cultural? Although it seems they are cultural, they are 'human traits' in that they express human nature. MacIntyre does not basis virtue enough in metaphysical biology; Foot bases it too much in metaphysical biology; McDowell bases virtue in reason but does not explain the relation of reason to metaphysical biology. Foot is closest to my view, but I supplement her view with arguments to the effect that normativity (including teleology) is built-in to nature as a whole, not just humanity. 

### Human Origins

What is human nature? In short, we don’t know. For all we can tell without the benefit of divine revelation, humanity is an anomaly. Our origin is shrouded in mystery, our destiny undecided. The story we are told in biology and anthropology textbooks is that 200,000 years ago, hominids somehow developed new cognitive abilities sufficient to justify calling one or a set of these creatures “the first humans.” Our earliest direct, archeological evidence of our ancestors is that they were artists: paintings adorn the caves of France. 


### Human Destinies

If our origin is shrouded in mystery, our future destiny is relatively clear. By any account, our species is doomed.  The science fiction dream of off-world colonies is most likely just a dream: no livable other planet has been discovered within our solar system or any of the surrounding regions. Even if one were discovered further out, along concentric circles each lightyears in diameter, the practical limitations on space travel for large numbers across unimaginable distances render off-world colonization virtually impossible. The only possibility left, itself highly impracticable, seems to me that scientific technology advances to a point that we can conceivably *create* an atmosphere on a planet that does not currently have one. 

Regardless of these dreams, if our current planet does not go into an ice age, or a dust bowl, or become a nuclear wasteland, or if a volcanic canopy does not eliminate conditions for organic life, then *eventually* the running down of our sun will condemn our species to the same fate of 99% of all species that have existed up until now: extinction.

Bertrand Russell faced this pessimistic doom with intellectual courage and a glinting eye. 


## McDowell

McDowell disagrees with Foot here. An evaluative judgment cannot be lifted, without intermediary, from a factual judgment. But then again, factual judgments cannot even be made without intermediation from human consciousness. There is no “Given”. Unless consciousness has ‘spontaneous’ activity already active in its receptivity to empirical experience, there is no empirical experience of things *as* being this way rather than that. 

McDowell is not alone in this criticism: Thompson, Allen, “Reconciling Themes in Neo-Aristotelian Meta-Ethics”, The Journal of Value Inquiry (2007) 41:245-263.

>The objection I think I understand and want to take seriously starts from the thought that in employing such notions as life and organism and life-form or species we introduce something foreign, in particular something ‘biological’, or crudely empirical, into the elements of ethical theory. Any such view, one thinks, must involve either a vulgar scientistic dissolution of the ethical, tending maybe toward an ‘evolutionary ethics’, or else the covert substitution of an outdated metaphysics for what we know to be empirical. Each path leads to its own absurdities. Together they may be thought to betray a yearning to view our practices ‘from outside’ or ‘from sideways on’ in hope perhaps of providing them with a foundation or an external grounding.[@thompson2008life]

Along similar lines, others have complained that Foot’s neo-Aristotelian “naturalism” does not amount to a naturalistic theory. They object that Foot is not a "naturalist." 
> …we can see that Foot’s naturalism offers a fresh approach to objectivism in ethics. Yet, in spite of such attractions, *Natural Goodness* is in the midst of a cool reception. Here, I will argue that this reception is due to the fact that Foot’s naturalism draws on a picture of the biological world that is at odds with the view embraced by most contemporary scientists and philosophers. Foot’s readers commonly assume that the account of the biological world that she must want to adhere to, and that she nevertheless mistakenly departs from, is the account offered by contemporary neo-Darwinian biological sciences.[@hacker2009natural 309]

Richard Bernstein calls John McDowell’s naturalism a much needed “novel twist” on the stalemate between those who think naturalism will eventually make good on its promise to naturalize reason and those who are sick of waiting and ready to give up. 

He quotes Joseph Margolis and Mark Gottlieb as saying that: 

> Naturalism in the current analytic sense may well be the dominant programmatic orientation of Anglo-American philosophy. It may be characterized as an informally linked family of doctrines and strategies broadly in accord with 'ancestral' themes of W. V. O. Quine's "Epistemology Naturalized." The original themes feature in Quine include: a preference for physicalism of one sort or another, a strong emphasis on the continuity of science and philosophy, particularly at the explanatory level, and the effective replacement of legitimate inquiries of a typically noncausal sort by causal inquiries centering on belief." (Berstein 58) 

The "specter of Kant keeps surfacing in thinkers like Putnam and Habermas who are convinced that reason cannot be naturalized" (Berstein 59). The "novel twist" comes from John McDowell. Berstein says that “at first glance, it seems that McDowell fits right into the tradition of Kantian anti-naturalism — a tradition that runs from Kant right up to Putnam and Habermas” since he thinks “reason can’t be naturalized” (Bernstein 62). But his arguments, Berstein thinks, against bald naturalism amount to some sophisticated question-begging via sleight of hand. Even so, when we look at particular “first order claims...""



## An argument that generics can serve as bases for ethical arguments

What each of these theorists overlook is the comprehensiveness of virtue. Virtues are *human* excellences. 

It is no secret in philosophy that to prove one's thesis one must begin by assuming, on the first page, a premise which necessarily entails one's conclusion. 

Such reasoning is, in one sense, circular and so may appear vicious: *Why should I grant your first premise?* the reader might ask. But in another sense it is not vicious. For any case intended to establish that *p* must take some point q or r as a hypothesis. Even if one tries to establish that q or p, one will do so by assuming s or t, and the problem reiterates. If nothing is granted, nothing can be proved. 

The consequence of this reflection is that a great deal depends upon one's choice of starting premises. 

My starting premise is this: **some generic, scientific statements are true.** That is, some of our empirical observations, and our rational reflection upon such observations, and our conclusions in the form of "generics" (to be explained below) which are scientific conclusions derived upon such reflections and observations, are true.

So for example, even by the's terms I observe that the penguins appear to be birds (they have beaks, feathers, lay eggs, emit squawks, etc.). I reflect that most -- if not all birds -- have many of these macro features. I consult my encyclopedias, biology or zoology textbooks, or friends who are zoologists, and ask them whether penguins indeed are birds. They all confirm the categorization. From observations and reflections such as these, penguins earned an entry in the annals of scientific knowledge. They get a scientific name ('sphenisciformes'), a somewhat speculative, half-formed evolutionary history, and increasingly detailed descriptions of their characteristics, genetics, environments, diet, predators, and so on. The scientific conclusion, upon initial observation, bolstered by reflection, is the statement that: penguins are birds.

My premise is that some such statements are true. Alternately, it is false that every such scientific statement is false. 

The denial of my premise is, I think, an absurdity. That is not to say that the denial of the premise is not worth considering. It might well be true. My point in calling the denial 'absurd' is to say that if it is true, an absurdity is true. If it is true, then the truth is absurd. And reality itself might well be absurd. I don't think it is, but there have been many philosophers who have thought so, and such thoughts cannot be justly dismissed without consideration. The absurdist (let us call her) who thinks all such scientific statements are systematically false would cheerfully deny that "suns are stars", "water is H2O", and "humans are mammals." She would renounce the bizarre belief that the earth orbits the sun or the unconscionable faith that earthquakes are caused by tectonic plate shifts. She is free to deny my thesis. 

Every premise is an invitation to a set of readers. Simply by beginning my inquiry with the assumption that "God exists", I invite fellow theists, and repel all but masochistic atheists; by beginning with the assumption that "no god exists", I invite fellow atheists (and repel all but masochistic theists.) 

My premise that some scientific conclusions are true invites fellow scientific realists, rationalists, and empiricists to the inquiry. It disinvites (though they are of course welcome to eavesdrop) philosophers of different persuasions: transcendental idealists, nihilists, scientific anti-realists, and so on. 

Another term for what I have called 'scientific statements' is generic statements, Aristotelian categoricals, natural-historical statements. Andrew Bailey's recent paper summarizes generics in the following way: 

>We treat ‘we are animals’ as a generic... What are generics? A fine question, but a difficult one. Start with this sentence: ‘Buddhists are way into meditation’. This first sentence is, let us suppose, true. So far so good. But is it equivalent to ‘for every x, if x is a Buddhist, x is way into meditation’? It does not appear to be. For the second sentence might be false (some Buddhists might not be way into meditation) even if the first sentence is, as we have supposed, true. The first sentence could be true, somehow, even if not all Buddhists are way into meditation (similarly, ‘ducks lay eggs’ may be true even if not all ducks lay eggs, ‘mosquitos carry dengue fever’ may be true even if only a very few mosquitos carry that virus, and so on). We are now positioned to observe one curious property of generics: they admit of exceptions. Generic animalism, accordingly, may admit of exceptions without threat to its truth; generic animalism is consistent, for example, with the thesis that there are human persons who are not human animals. [bailey2015animalism 869]













### The thesis

Without further ado, my thesis is that some human attributes -- traits, habits, actions -- can be known to be right or wrong because of the natural, scientific, teleological facts about human beings as a species. 

Such a thesis will feel absurd to some readers. I invite them to justify the feeling. In the meantime I shall try to prove that the thesis follows from the assumption that some scientific statements (derived from observation and reflection) are true. Readers are welcome to join the absurdist in denying my first premise; and they are of course welcome to try to find a weak link in the chain of reasoning, though I hope there is none. But if they accept the premise then they are not free -- not free rationally to deny the thesis. 

### The argument in brief

To get from the premise to the conclusion we need a few steps: 

1. Some scientific statements are true. 
2. In general, some scientific statements are normative and evaluative via natural teleology; the have natural species terms as subjects and evaluative terms as predicates.
3. Some subset of these (scientific statements that are normative/evaluative via natural teleology) are true. 
4. Humans can be the subjects of scientific statements; the species 'human' can be the minor term of logical propositions. 
5. Some scientific statements in which 'human' is the minor term have evaluative terms as predicates. 
6. True scientific evaluative statements about humans denote what is right or wrong. 


In short: 

Data: Some true scientific, generic statements about human beings are teleological, normative, and evaluative.

Evidence: If some scientific, generic statements about human beings are teleological, normative, and evaluative, then some human behaviors and traits can be known to be right or wrong because of the natural, scientific, teleological facts about human beings as a species.

Conclusion: Some human behaviors and traits can be known to be right or wrong because of the natural, scientific, teleological facts about human beings as a species.

### The argument

Premise 1 I assume, and take for granted. 

Premise 2 needs some arguing. Here, Philippa Foot's arguments are needed to show that the critic cannot deny 2 without denying premise 1. No sooner have I been told that penguins are birds than I am told "All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above." Talk of being shaded *for camouflage* is, of course, normative talk. Such talk is, more specifically, teleological talk. Natural teleology makes possible scientific, evaluative statements. 

Premise 3 follows from 1 and 2. Some scientific statements are true; some evaluative statements are scientific; therefore some evaluative statements are true. 

Premise 4 needs some arguing, but I think it is fairly easy to prove to be true. Since human beings are animals, and all animals are natural entities, human beings are natural entities. 

By calling us 'natural' I do not mean to invoke here all the controversies surrounding the word; more on that below. For now, calling us 'natural' is an innocent truism. Are we here, in nature? Yes. Are we material -- not necessarily *wholly* material, but are we *at least* material at all? Yes. Do we eat food grown on earth, drink water from the earth, are we born from fellow humans and do we die and disintegrate into the earth like every other living thing? Yes. So we are natural. Again, I do not mean to prejudge the question of whether we are *also more than natural*. I simply mean to invoke the obvious that the *we are at least natural*.

Since we are (at least) natural entities, and since scientific statements are about natural entities, then it is possible (and indeed quite common) to make scientific statements about us. 'Humans emigrated from Africa about 200,000 years ago' is a statement about a natural species group, namely *homo sapiens sapiens*, the only extant members of the hominin clade. 'Humans are language users' is a generic scientific statement. 

Premise 5 is, again, not too troublesome. If some scientific statements are evaluative (via natural teleology) and humans can be the objects of scientific evaluative statements, then some statements about human beings are evaluative via natural teleology. 

Statement 6, the conclusion, is true just in case that some scientific statements with evaluative predicates about humans are true. Those statements would give us knowledge of right and wrong based upon what facts about the human species. 

### Premise 2 -- Some scientific statements are teleology

James Barham

Philippa Foot

Andrew Bailey

Michael Chorost

> Natural teleology is unorthodox, but it has a long and honorable history. For example, in 1953 the evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley argued that it's in the nature of nature to get more advanced over time. "If we take a snapshot view, improvement eludes us," he wrote. "But as soon as we introduce time, we see trends of improvement."

>More recently, Kevin Kelly, founding editor of Wired, made the case for teleology as clearly as could be in his book What Technology Wants: "Evolution ... has an inherent direction, shaped by the nature of matter and energy." That is, there may be laws of nature that push the universe toward the creation of life and mind. Not a supernatural god, but laws as basic and fundamental as those of thermodynamics. Robert Wright said much the same in Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny: "This book is a full-throated argument for destiny in the sense of direction." Those books prompted discussion among the literati but little backlash from evolutionary biologists. Ruse thinks that's because the authors are science writers, not scientists: "At a certain level, it's their job either to give the science or to put forward provocative hypotheses, and nobody takes it personally."



>The paleontologist Simon Conway Morris, at the University of Cambridge, has argued that natural structures such as eyes, neurons, brains, and hands are so beneficial that they will get invented over and over again. They are, in effect, attractors in an abstract biological space that pull life in their direction. Contingency and catastrophe will delay them but cannot stop them. Conway Morris sees this as evidence that not only life but human life, and humanlike minds, will emerge naturally from the cosmos: "If we humans had not evolved, then something more or less identical would have emerged sooner or later."

>Stuart Kauffman, of the Santa Fe Institute, who argues that the universe gives us "order for free." Kauffman has spent decades on origin-of-life research, aiming to show that the transition from chemistry to metabolism is as inevitable as a ball rolling down a slope. Molecules on the early earth, he suggests, inevitably began to catalyze themselves in self-sustaining reactions ("autocatalytic networks"), converting energy and raw materials into increasingly complex structures that eventually crossed the boundary between nonliving and living.

>Other biologists are proposing laws that would explain evolutionary ascent in fundamental terms. Daniel McShea and Robert Brandon, a biologist and a philosopher of science, respectively, at Duke University, have argued for what they call a "zero-force evolutionary law," which posits that diversity and complexity will necessarily increase even without environmental change. The chemist Addy Pross, at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in Israel, argues that life exhibits "dynamic kinetic stability," in which self-replicating systems become more stable through becoming more complex—and are therefore inherently driven to do so.

>Still other scientists have asked how we could measure increases in complexity without being biased by our human-centric perspective. Robert Hazen, working with the Nobel Prize winner Jack Szostak, has proposed a metric he calls "functional information," which measures the number of functions and relationships an organism has relative to its environment. The Harvard astrophysicist Eric Chaisson has proposed measuring a quantity that he calls "energy-rate density": how much energy flows through one gram of a system per second. He argues that when he plots energy-rate density against the emergence of new species, the clear result is an overall increase in complexity over time.


>But Nagel's goal was valid: to point out that fundamental questions of origins, evolution, and intelligence remain unanswered, and to question whether current ways of thinking are up to the task. A really good book on this subject would need to be both scientific and philosophical: scientific to show what is known, philosophical to show how to go beyond what is known. (A better term might be "metascientific," that is, talking about the science and about how to make new sciences.)

>The pieces of this book are scattered about the landscape, in a thousand scraps of ideas from biologists, physicists, physicians, chemists, mathematicians, journalists, public intellectuals, and philosophers. But no book has yet emerged that is mighty enough to shove aside the current order, persuading scientists and nonscientists alike, sparking new experiments, changing syllabi, rejiggering budget priorities, spawning new departments, and changing human language and ways of thought forever. On the Origin of Species did it in 1859. We await the next Darwin.^[Michael Chorost is the author of Rebuilt: How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human (Houghton Mifflin, 2005) and World Wide Mind: The Coming Integration of Humanity, Machines, and the Internet (Free Press, 2011).]


### More details of the argument

'Human beings are rational animals' is a generic. It is also evaluative/normative. An *irrational* human is ipso facto defective. To call a human 'defective' sounds like a schoolyard insult; but it is a straightforward, evaluative description of some people. I do not here intend to discuss mental illness, disability, birth defect, chromosomal disorders, and other such exceptions to 'normal' functional humans. 

Can we get from such vague statements to particular moral statements? 'Human beings make and keep promises.' Perhaps. Here is one way such a connection might work. 

From 'human beings are rational animals' we can derive 'human beings are language users' by the major premise that 'rational animals are language users.' This major premise is, I think, eminently plausible. One of the identifiers of rationality of other animals (dolphins, great apes) is simply the presence of language. Language is, I presume, a system of signs; if a crow or even an insect such as a bee can be shown to be using signs, many would conclude that ipso facto those creatures would be rational in some sense. Regardless, the question of whether any other animals besides us are rational is identical to the question of whether any other animal uses language the way we do. 

So what does it mean to be a language user? One of the things language can do is refer to events not yet happened, or events no longer happening. To express intentions to do X or not Y in the future requires language. There is some connection here, perhaps not enough, but some connection between language use and promise keeping. A kind of necessity. 

Ignorance is not good for human beings. 'Rational animals seek knowledge when they have plenty of food, water, and shelter.' is perhaps another safe generic. One might say I am trying to express "the value of knowledge" or some such fluffy phrase, but I am not doing any such thing. I am trying to articulate a true, scientific generic about human beings as they are. Certainly, it is a normative statement; but so is 'lizards seek warm rocks at night time.' One can disagree with the truth value of a statement like 'rational animals seek knowledge' but one cannot throw out the whole category of such statements without also denying my starting premise, that all such scientific statements are systematically false. 

Explorations of 'what rationality *is*' are bound to be controversial. I do not want to develop a fully formed theory of rationality here. I only want to articulate a few possible specific examples of generic statements that (in my terms) are evaluative truths true in virtue of our species, that (in my opponents terms) do double duty as scientific descriptions and "moral" norms. These examples are needed to give some flesh and bones to my primary contention, that there exist *at least some* true scientific evaluative statements about humans. 

One more will suffice here. 'Rational beings seek the good.' I don't mean that we always seek what is *actually* good; a jihadist is seeking a great evil which they have mistaken for a good. Nor does it mean that we *actually* seek what is good; an immoderate, overweight, diabetic person may quite intentionally overeat, knowing how unhealthy it is. A habitually foolish person may spend all her money every time she receives a paycheck, even though she knows she will never be able comfortably to retire. Rational beings seek the good. 


### An initial endgame 

Let's review. Generics are normative/descriptive statements that pick out what is formally true of a species. They are a huge percentage of scientific conclusions derived from observation (both unstructured and experimental observation) and from rational reflection upon such observations. 

I have attempted to find in generics some hope for a naturalistic morality. A statement like 'human beings are rational animals' are both descriptive and normative. They (attempt to) describe human nature as a species rather than merely to observe highly contextualized statistical regularities, such as 'human beings wear jeans and t-shirts'. As such, generics (promise to) overcome the much-touted and much fear fact/value split. Generics render moot Moore's so-called 'naturalistic fallacy.' Generics, being is/ought statements, underwrite 'ought' conclusions with the addition of an 'is' premise: Human beings seek knowledge (that is, human beings do seek it and ought to seek it). Bob is a human being. Bob ought to seek knowledge. 

All I have tried to prove is that *some* of these generics are true. I have not tried to prove finally which ones are true. I chose some examples that I think are true and that I rather hope are not too far-fetched for most of my audience. These examples, though, are illustrative not argumentative. In the next chapter, I shall do a good deal more to try to establish specific propositions that some might describe as "moral precepts" but which I shall describe simply as generic facts about human nature. But for now, I welcome disagreement as to the content of the generics.  

To those who disagree about the *nature* of generics. I have tried to urge them to feel free to do so, but to count the cost. The great cost of throwing out generics *as a class* threatens to throw out a huge percentage of scientific statements in biology, organic chemistry, anthropology, psychology, sociology, economics, anatomy, and medicine. 

### McDowell's Worry about the Given

My argument thus far runs afoul of several objections. The most penetrating is John McDowell. His worry is that by deriving moral or more broadly normative conclusions from "scientific" premises assumes a "given". The problem with assuming a Given is that the Given is a myth. That is, McDowell is an idealist *of a sort* -- even our experiences are colored, structured, or otherwise affected by our own powers of perception and reflection. 

Earlier I caricatured scientific knowledge as observing stuff and reflecting upon it to derive scientific conclusions. McDowell would respond that even our "spontaneous" reflective powers are already embroiled in our empirical observations. 

### The response

What are we to say to McDowell? In one sense, I have already said it. McDowell rejects "the Given" in all its forms. Hence he is not a scientific realist. He does not think it true that penguins are birds in the sense that a 'truth' is both the mind-independent reality and the content of a thought that corresponds to reality. He does not think that penguins being birds is a fact about the world as such. Of course, penguins being *classified* as birds is not a fact about the world as such; classification is something (human) scientists do. But he does not think there is a *structure* to the world such that all birds have real properties in common. 

If this is true, he rejects my initial premise: he denies that "some of our scientific conclusions derived upon reflection and observation are true." And my audience cannot follow McDowell there. 

Nevertheless, I think it worthwhile to respond to McDowell and will do so. 

      This section begins to head metaphysical. I will have to decide when and wear to make these arguments. The Chapter on Naturalism, for instance. I will also have to decide where to 



## 5. Why is it "necessary" to be virtuous? Although it seems that virtues are optional,  they partly constitute human flourishing, which everyone ought to want, while the vices partly constitute misery, which everyone ought to avoid.  It is necessary because it is human. Justice, prudence, and courage are "needed in any human-scale enterprise"[@geach ], from motherhood, to a successful career, to farming. Put negatively, the thesis of this chapter is that vices necessarily contribute to misery, unhappiness, and human stultification and stagnation. Human nature is the starting point, flourishing is the goal, and the moral and intellectual virtues are the means by which we move from start to goal. 



### Vices are despicable qualities that constitute misery

Put negatively, vices are those qualities that partly constitute human misery. Many kinds of living conditions are miserable; excessive cold or heat; starvation; illness; mental handicap; injury; extreme isolation and loneliness, and so on. But these kinds of circumstances are not *always* and *necessarily* miserable. Rather, being a lying, treacherous, scheming, envious, whining, daydreaming good-for-nothing is truly miserable, even such happens to have a comfortable bed to sleep in and enough money to get through life. Such a person is despicable, a worthy specimen of human failure. 

Some vices, especially intellectual vices, are especially despicable. Not everyone has equal amounts of intelligence conceived as raw mental horsepower. Some children even at a young age excel at doing “mental math” or memorizing geographical names, while others never acquire the knack for it. However, not all unintelligent people are stupid in the deplorable sense: stubborn, unteachable, slow to learn and resenting every bit, arrogant, smug, self-satisfied, and willfully ignorant. Such persons demonstrate intellectual vices noxious to all their fellows except those equally debased, and especially noxious to those unfortunate enough to be their teachers, parents, or guardians. And such intellectual vices are in a special way exemplary of human failing. 

## 6. What is human flourishing? Although it seems to be merely pleasure or worldly success, and though I shall define it more later, I mean generally "well-being", tru ehappiness, human success as such.  

## 7. Supposing that virtues *benefit their possessor*, is it then egoistic or selfish to pursue virtue? Although it seems we only need virtue if we want to be happy, everyone has an obligation to develop virtuous traits because virtues help us become who we are. Such a pursuit is not selfish in the pejorative sense of the word; it is not 'egoism' for the charge of egoism assumes that the good for men is not *the good* per se. 

## 8. Can the virtuous person be irrational? 


### Practical Wisdom is the greatest

Practical wisdom, then, has pride of place. There are other virtues besides practical wisdom; Socrates was wrong there. And Maggie Little is wrong to suggest that virtue is knowledge *and nothing more*.[@little2007virtue. It is not totally clear to me from this essay whether she means to suggest this point or not; but the suggestion is there and she does nothing to counteract it.] But it is correct that wisdom has pride of place. Courage without wisdom ceases even to be courage. 

## 9. Can virtues be put to bad use? 

### 10 Are virtues acquirable only or innate?

These qualities are acquirable. Not everyone has equal opportunity to acquire them — moral education is helpful; virtuous parents and teachers are helpful; social conditions wherein vice will not be gratuitously rewarded or virtues gratuitously punished are helpful. Yet every human being has equal responsibility to acquire them. 

They are, it seems necessary for success in any worthwhile human endeavor. Most people in the world will not write books or even read many books; however, every human being in the world has biological parents and hence has family. Every living human being belongs to a community; even orphans and street urchins live in a community. 




### Moral Education ####

The beginning and end of practical life are the least discussed but most important. 

Often the biggest and most obvious facts are the hardest to see. For example, when I ask students to point out anything they see — anything at all, hidden or apparent —  they typically look around and start naming medium-sized objects in their field of vision: this chair, that wall, that tree, that person, or perhaps those atoms and molecules, that sunlight. They never say the biggest and most obvious thing: the ground. 

When discussing the morality of adults, we often leave out the biggest and most obvious source of our morality. The source of our morality is not our professors in college, our ethics textbooks, our favorite novel, or even (for religious folk) our Holy Bible. The biggest and most obvious fact about our morality (and our moral psychology and a whole lot else) is our parents. 

Most of us grew up in the context of nuclear families. So our biological parent or parents both conceived, raised, cared for, and educated us — including education in do’s and don’ts of life. 

The reason we must keep parents in mind is that the two most significant periods, in one sense of significance, of our ethical lives are the very beginning and the very end. 

The latter phase of human life, say, from 50-80 (for those who live that long) is the period in which our habits are most firmly established and the consequences of our choices are most apparent. There is a time delay between the decision to cultivate a character trait and the rewards (or punishments) of becoming that kind of person. 

The middle period (say, ages 25-55) are where we are most autonomous. We are fully functioning agents. We have projects, aims, goals, ethical principles (or a principled lack thereof), weaknesses, given temptations, vices, defects, as well as strengths, virtues, and a host of other habits we may call morally neutral. This is also the period when we philosophers tend to write books about morality. But just because this is the period in which moral philosophers write books about morality doesn’t mean this period is the most moral significant. 

There is a truism that all the really significant doctrines about life — all the really impactful beliefs and habits — we don’t learn in school; we learn them all by the time we enter school (around age 5). We learn how to relate to other humans, how to relate to authority, how to speak our native language, we learn (for the most part, but not exclusively) what is valuable in life — learning, money, position, friendship, power, and so on.
