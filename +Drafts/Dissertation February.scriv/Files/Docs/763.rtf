\f0\fs20 \cf0 ### Growing up\
MacIntyre grew up inside two cultures: a rustic Scottish fishing culture and an elite Scottish intellectual culture. For this reason, in part, his theory emphasizes the importance of being able to understand multiple cultures. He attended Epsom College at age sixteen where he was tutored by R. G. Collinwood. He acquired an interest in ethics during undergraduate study and wrote his M.A. thesis critiquing the emotivism of C. L. Stevenson.}
