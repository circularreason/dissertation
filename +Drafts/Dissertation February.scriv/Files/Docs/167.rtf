\f0\fs28 \cf0 Wittgenstein\'92s despairing nihilism he expresses as: \'93The right method of philosophy would be this: To say nothing except what can be said, I.e., the propositions of natural science, I.e., something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions.\'94 (
\i Tractates 
\i0 6.53)\

The assumption that \'93natural science\'94 delivers or consists in a series of propositions in which all the signs have \'93nothing to do with philosophy\'94 is false.  }
