### Are moral reasons one type of practical reason? No

The first question to be asked is whether, according to neo-Aristotelians, moral reasons are *one type* of practical reason, or does any practical reason count as a "moral" reason (broadly construed)?[@foot2002virtues chapter 13, "Are Moral Reasons Overriding?"; Cf. also @mcdowell1978moral] The question receives its urgency from two quarters: the first is the familiar Kantian distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. Kant assumed that one's natural selfish inclinations took as practical reasons anything that lead to one's happiness or well-being; the moral law provided reasons to do one's duty, sometimes in accord with, but often against one's inclinations. The second is the familiar modern assumption that the philosophical ethics is to resolve ethical dilemmas. 

Edmund Pincoffs distinguishes two broad conceptions of philosophical ethics he calls “Quandary Ethics” and “Character Ethics.” Quandary ethics is focused on the short-term resolution of immediate moral problems, either by dissolving moral perplexity or giving some (hopefully rational) basis for a particular decision or course of action; character ethics is focused on the long-term goal of living well by executing worthwhile goals in every day life. The Quandary ethicists are those Pincoffs quotes at the beginning of his article (such as Hare, Toulon, Brandt). They think that “the business of ethics is to clarify and solve "problems ", i.e. situations in which it is difficult to know what one should do; that the ultimate beneficiary of ethical analysis is the person who, in one of these situations, seeks rational ground for the decision he must make; that ethics is therefore primarily concerned to find such grounds, often conceived of as moral rules and the principles from which they can be derived; and that meta-ethics consists in the analysis of the terms, claims, and arguments which come into play in moral disputation, deliberation, and justification in problematic contexts.”[@pincoffs1971quandary 552] 

By contrast, Aristotle is an example of a Character Ethicist. 

>[Aristotle] as is well known, thought of ethics as a branch of politics, which in turn he thought of as a very wide-ranging subject having to do generally with the planning of human life so that it could be lived as well as possible. Moral problems are given their due but are by no means stage-centre. The question is not so much how we should resolve perplexities as how we should live.[@pincoffs1971quandary 553-4] 

How do we live *well*? This is the first question of life that human beings, upon arriving at the age of reflection, ask. It is also the first question of ethical philosophers. The goal is broad, to understand virtue, wisdom, and happiness with an eye to becoming virtuous, wise, and happy in spite of the odds and in spite of the temptations to vice and the inevitable distractions and obstacles of chance. 


The neo-Aristotelian view is more comprehensive than either of these assumptions. It is a Character Ethics. Practical reason is the entire faculty for judging what counts as a reason in favor or against a particular course of action, comparing multiple reasons, weighing competing or conflicting reasons, fashioning a plan by which to live one's whole life, reflecting on one's life and evaluating its success or failure thus far. In this comprehensive view, the business of practical reasoning is to consider *all* the potential requirements on human action -- be they moral, aesthetic, social, prudential, religious, or what have you. 

There are two angles from which we can approach this thesis. The first angle is to argue that "morality" is the domain of *practicality* as a whole. The second angle is to show how "morality" (in a different sense of the term) is one particular sub-domain of practicality, namely, those having to do with other agents. I shall call this "second-personal morality."

Let's argue the first point first. As Martha Nussbaum paraphrases the question “how do specifically moral ends and commitments figure among the ends that [a moral agent] pursues?” in this way: 

>This question is posed in a characteristically modern way, presupposing a distinction between the moral and the non-moral that is not drawn, as such, by the Greek thinkers. But if one objects to that characterization, one can rephrase it: for example, What role does concern for other for their own sake play in here scheme of ends? What role does political justice play in her scheme of ends? And so forth.”[@nussbaum1999virtue 174] 

Nussbaum’s paraphrase makes clear that our narrowed sense of ‘moral’ means simply obligations to others.

Foot makes a similar point in distinguishing our sense of 'moral' from the older sense.

>Many if not most moral philosophers in modern times see their subject as having to do exclusively with relations between individuals or between an individual and society, and so with such things as obligations, duties, and charitable acts. It is for this reason that, of the four ancient cardinal virtues of justice, courage, temperance, and wisdom, only the first now seems to belong wholly to ‘morality’. The other three virtues are recognized as necessary for the practice of ‘morality’ but are now thought of as having part of their exercise ‘outside morality’ in ‘self‐regarding’ pursuits, ‘moral’ and ‘prudential’ considerations being contrasted in a way that was alien to Plato or Aristotle.4 J. S. Mill, for instance, expresses this modern point of view quite explicitly, saying in his essay On Liberty that ‘A person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self‐conceit . . . who cannot restrain himself from harmful indulgences’ shows faults (Mill calls them ‘self‐regarding faults’) which ‘are not properly immoralities’ and while they ‘may be proofs of any amount of folly . . . are only a subject of moral reprobation when they involve a breach of duty to others, for whose sake the individual is bound to have care for himself’.[@foot2001natural 68]

Foot asks: "How is it then that moral evaluation seems to most philosophers nowadays to be a very special subject, that may have to be understood in terms of the expression of special mental states such as approval, or mental acts such as endorsing?"[@foot2001natural 67] 

The answer is contained in the conceptual history of these terms. MacIntyre summarizes: 

>'Moral’ is the etymological descendant of ‘moralis’. But ‘moralis’, like its Greek predecessor *ethikos* --  Cicero invented ‘moralis’ to translate the Greek word in the *De Fato* -- means ‘pertaining to character’ where a man’s character is nothing other than his set dispositions to behave systematically in one way rather than another, to lead on particular kind of life... The early uses of 'moral' did not contrast with “‘prudential’ or ‘self interested’” nor with “‘legal or ‘religious’”. MacIntyre concludes: “The word to which it is closest in meaning is perhaps most simply ‘practical’.”[@macintyre1984after 38] 

Practicality as a whole domain was sub-divided. The conventional distinction that “morality” is a special sub-division pertaining to right and wrong behavior toward others traces to the 1700s, where “immorality” meant sexual misbehavior.  The conventional separation of “moral” from “non-moral” considerations traces to John Stuart Mill who divided the former domain as concerned with duties to benefit and to not harm others.[@macintyre1984after 39]




MacIntyre's earliest ethical work distinguished the significance of moral judgments compared to other kinds of judgments. In a careful critique of both intuitionists such as Moore and emotivists such as Stevenson, MacIntyre concluded that both (mistakenly) assume that moral judgments and moral terms have significance only in their referential meaning. The intuitionists, of course, concluded that moral terms refer to a non-natural property, while the emotivists concluded that moral terms do not refer to such a property and so do not refer at all. (Naturalists, later in the 20th century, argue that moral terms refer to natural properties.) MacIntyre’s alternative denies the assumption entirely; moral judgments “have their own kind of logic” and their significance, like other kinds of judgments, comes from “exhibiting the logic of their usage.”[@murphy2003macintyre 118, quoting p. 73 of MacIntyre’s master’s thesis *The Significance of Moral Judgments*] The significance of moral judgments is that “they enable us to solve problems of appraisal and of action.” Solving problems of evaluation (we might say) and action is their place in “a pattern of language and action…” He continues: 

>Above all they arise out of the way in which we see the world and the way in which our language allows us to see the world. We cannot sufficiently emphasize the direction given to our appraisals by the language which happens to be available for our descriptions. It is as we see the facts that we judge the world.

MacIntyre’s point is that moral judgments are not *simply* useful in moral dilemmas or quandaries. They appear, at the earliest stages of childhood development, in a pattern of usage that is inextricable from the human activities of reasoning, acting, and appraising. Evaluative judgments appear in the widest imaginable spread of human activities, from politics to playgrounds, from sociology to social life, from the practices of law and medicine to the professions of journalism and psychology, from the sciences to the arts. Even if this point be granted, moral dilemmas are not *unreal*. Moral dilemmas are a special version of our general “problems of appraisal and action.” They may be particularly vexing, but they are no different from the general problems of how to live, how to be happy, what kinds of public policies to pursue, what apparently meaningful types of life are really meaningful. 



### Is morality only about how we treat others? 

Is practical reason egoistic or can we undermine the distinction between 'self-regarding' and 'other-regarding' virtues[@slote1995agent], between self-love and conscience?[@annas2009egoism; @macintyre1967egoism; @bloomfield2012eudaimonia; @huang2010self] 

Although it seems "morality" is narrowly about how we treat others, the whole practical domain is about self- and other-regarding virtues, and identifying what is intrinsically good and admirable in itself. 


The first point is that 'morality' may be taken as synonymous with the whole practical domain. 

In order to further defend the point, it may be helpful to explain why, for many of us, morality is a special domain contrasted with or even opposed to domains of prudence, etc. 

How did this broad sense of 'morality' narrow?

First, moral meant any particular way of life — something like idiosyncrasy, habit, character. Second, it meant any practical lesson — something like the “moral of the story”, the point, that to be acted on, the rule, the maxim. Third, it came to mean a domain of rules of conduct that are “neither theological nor legal nor aesthetic”[@macintyre1984after 39]

Foot argues, I think rightly, that qualities such as benevolence and generosity we tend to call human “moral goodness” are of a type with a broader category of goodness.  She says: “I want to show that judgments usually considered to be the special subject of moral philosophy should really be seen as belonging to a wider class of evaluations of conduct with which they share a common conceptual structure.” [@foot2001natural 66-67] 


Anscombe notes: 

>The terms “should” or “ought” or “needs” relate to good and bad: e.g. machinery needs oil, or should or ought to be oiled, in that running without oil is bad for it, or it runs badly without oil. According to this conception, of course, "should" and "ought" are not used in a special "moral" sense when one says that a man should not bilk. (In Aristotle's sense of the term "moral" [ήθικός], they are being used in connection with a moral subject‑matter: namely that of human passions and [non‑technical] actions.) But they have now acquired a special so‑called "moral" sense-‑i.e. a sense in which they imply some absolute verdict (like one of guilty/not guilty on a man) on what is described in the "ought" sentences used in certain types of context: not merely the contexts that Aristotle would call "moral"‑-passions and actions‑-but also some of the contexts that he would call "intellectual.”[@anscombe1958]



Now, the domain of duties and obligations pertaining to others is a real domain and a legitimate division. But the division is not between morality and non-morality but between different types of morality or sub-domains.
