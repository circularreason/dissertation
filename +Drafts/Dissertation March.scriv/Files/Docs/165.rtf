\f0\fs28 \cf0 Finlay admirably summarizes the meta-ethical landscape with a taxonomy of views. The pressue is to satisfy objectivity (no values, just facts) and subjectivity (values). Michael Smith says something similar: "The task of the philosopher in meta-ethics is to make sense of ordinary moral practice. But the problem is that ordinary moral practice suggests that moral judgments hve two features that pull in quite opposite directions" (Smith 1994, 11). \
