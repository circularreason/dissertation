\f0\fs20 \cf0 ### Virtue\
MacIntyre's lifework has been an invitation to recover the tradition of virtues. But virtues are not free-floating moral concepts; they are embedded in a specific, living, moral tradition -- the Aristotelian tradition. This is one of MacIntyre's recurring themes: ethical concepts have *a history*. That is, we can only responsibly use or evaluate our own ethical terms and concepts when we have some historical perspective on them. Furthermore, *we* have a history. Practical concepts such as the self, practice, the *telos* or end of life, and virtue are all  MacIntyre realized that we all inhabit a tradition -- even putatively anti-traditionalist moderns. So we must know ourselves as members of a tradition, as members of a historically-extended social community with its own conceptual resources. These themes -- tradition have guided the construction of MacIntyre's virtue theory.}
