<p class="binderItem"><strong>Justification for Ethics and Naturalism</strong><br/>Hi Dr. Bradshaw,<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if you have some time to sit down in the next couple of weeks and talk about dissertation direction. <br/>
<br/>
The thought hit me pretty hard two weeks ago that I might want to adjust my research direction towards naturalism, specifically ethics and philosophy of mind. <br/>
<br/>
Here's my thinking. I've wanted to and planned to study ancient at a professional academic level since 2005. My two heroes from that season of life were Platonists. I read a lot of Plato, Plotinus, Proclu...</p>

<br/>
In chapter 1, I argue that normative realism is true. Chapter 1 has 2 parts. In the first, I summarize what I take to be the facts that need explaining. These explananda are the variety of kinds of normative discourse and objects of normative discourse represented in our life as lived. In the second, I argue that the best explanation of these phenomena will be normative realism: that is, normative discourse is truth-apt, that normative propositions are either true or false ...</p>

<br/>
2. Ethical non-naturalists looking for arguments for and against ethical naturalism. <br/>

The question of value’s relation to nature collapses into the question of humanity’s relation to (the rest of) nature. <br/>

There seem to be two options. Reduce value to nature in one step, or reduce value to human nature, and assume human nature is already reduced to or definitionally part of nature. The latter is two steps: humanize value, naturalize humanity.<br/>

Explanations explain phenomena that puzzle us. There are, in many cases, competing explanations that can't both be true but that are both plausible.

What is a virtue? And what does virtue talk do for ethical theory?

 <br/>
Richard Boyd’s metaethical project began in force with the influential “How to Be a Moral Realist” (1998). He established the strong plausibility of one kind of ethical naturalism. Boyd is not a non-cognitivist or “otherwise deflationary” naturalist. He is interested (along with S...</p>

Perhaps we should say that the relative merits of our metaethical account will modify the plausibility of our metaphysical theory, be it theistic or atheistic.

<br/>
Boyd and Railton are moral realists but ethical naturalists — Railton has playfully described himself as a “stark, raving moral real[ist]” in “Moral Naturalism.” In this essay, Railton summarizes the response of two camps to the conditional proposition that if moral realism is to be make “good sense” then reason or science must “afford a foundation for ethics” (163). The first camp affirms the antecedent and hence the consequent; the second camp denies the consequent and henc...</p>

The belief that 'nature is it' and 'science studies nature' has arisen from heresy to orthodoxy. <br/>
The objection from naturalists about morality or practical reasons is that they are not 'natural.' They are not real. <br/>
They are weird, queer, strange, sui generis, unprecedented, unexplainable, mysterious, obscure, opaque, supernatural, preternatural, and (of course) unnatural. <br/>
