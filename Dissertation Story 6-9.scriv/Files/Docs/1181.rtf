\f0\fs24 \cf0 Neo-Aristotelians appeal to the facts of natural species to build a normative ethics. Yet not even all neo-Aristotelians agree as to how to do this. Elizabeth Anscombe, for example, is not very optimistic about deriving norms from facts. She mentions that one might:\
\
>\'85look for 'norms' in human virtues: just as man has so many teeth, which is certainly not the average number of teeth men have, but is the number of teeth for the species, so perhaps the species man, regarded not just biologically, but from the point of view of the activity of thought and choice in regard to the various departments of life-powers and faculties and use of things needed- "has" such-and-such virtues: and this "man" with the complete set of virtues is the "norm," as "man" with, e.g., a complete set of teeth is a norm.^[@anscombe1958 14-15.]\

She's not very optimistic about this possibility because she does not think this sort of norm that can be derived from observation is likely to result in the kind of morally robust notion of justice that we might want. It's the descriptive norm of justice, she says, is likely to result in a sort of dog-eat-dog notion of "justice" like Thrasymachus held. }
