# Foot: Virtue as Natural Excellence


## Introduction ## (write second to last)

In this chapter, we turn our attention to Philippa Foot. Philippa Foot is a widely celebrated and idiosyncratic author. Her writings have been influential but often misunderstood. She does not — and proudly does not — conform to some of the pervasive expectations on analytic philosophers (and especially ethicists). This non-conformity both frees her from common prejudices but makes her liable to common misunderstandings. 

Her main thesis in “natural goodness” is similarly teleological: ‘goodness’ is a functional concept and applies (at least) to all *living natural* entities. “Natural goodness” for her does not refer to “natural law.”[@foot2001natural chapter 1] Foot’s contribution to an adequate foundation of virtue will be to render this account more plausible and to extend it by insightful reflection on moral language. Foot’s Natural Goodness (among other) also affords us an opportunity to revisit the assumptions of G.E. Moore and the Principia Ethica, criticizing them from a different angle than MacIntyre. 

We have had occasion to argue that teleology — at least social teleology —  is essential to ethics. Teleology is also a best “fit” for virtue ethics rather than modern rationalistic Kantian and utilitarian theories that make *duties themselves* or the external, contingent *consequences of actions* play the definitive role. Teleology may or may not be “natural” more broadly (inherent to the cosmos as a whole or inherent to all living things) but it is intrinsic to *human practices*. And, human practices, are *human*. We are practical creatures by nature. We’ve called this practicality and the claim that such practicality is end-directed or teleological “social teleology.” In this chapter, our aim is more ambitious: to argue that teleology is indeed natural in the biological sense. 

Such a claim is open to various objections, some vociferous. We must be willing to swim against the tide in order to even examine the evidence.

## Conclusion of Chapter (write last)


## What is virtue?

Foot's account of virtue unfolds across five points. Virtue is: beneficial, to self and others, while vice is bad for people; distinct from skills, fromm strength, keen eyesight, reliable memory, etc. because such excellences are not excellence of will; corrective of some tempting vice; only operative toward good ends; *natural* goodness, in a way that must be further explained. 

She begins with necessary conditions: A virtue is beneficial.[^10] She says, “Human beings do not get on well without them. Nobody can get on well if he lacks courage, and does not have some measure of temperance and wisdom, while communities where justice and charity re lacking are apt to be wretched places to live, as Russia was under the Stalinist terror.”[@foot2002virtues 2-3] But whom is benefited? Does a person possessing a virtue benefit the virtuous person or the society in which the virtuous person lives? For some virtues, the answer is more clearly “both”: temperance benefits oneself and one’s family or community. For other virtues, such as justice or charity, the answer is less clear. She says, “It is a reasonable opinion that on the whole a man is better off for being charitable and just, but this is not to say that circumstances may not arise in which he will have to sacrifice everything for charity or justice.”[@foot2002virtues 3] The cases in which virtuous deeds necessitate the loss of other goods are not so devestating as they might appear; if on occasion it is better (say) for my family that I sacrifice my health in working hard to earn wages,

The alternative to allowing that virtues are necessarily beneficial even if they are not necessarily beneficial to the possessor in every respect is to believe that every quality may be good or bad. Some qualities (say persistance) certainly do seem to be good or bad depending on other factors. But to deny that some qualities (kindness, cruelty) are really good and really bad is absurd. Furthermore, the assumed metaphysical disparity between my good and my neighbor's good is one of the sacred cows of modern ethical philoosophy we must question.

[^10]: She recommends examining Aristotle and Aquinas (and others) for their view on virtue, but cautions against terminological misunderstandings. *Arete* for them refers “also to arts, and even to excellences of the speculative intellect whose domain is theory rather than practice” (@foot2002virtues 2). *Arete ethikai* (or virtues morales) do not correspond to our moral virtues. For us, there are four moral virtues: courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice. For them, wisdom or *phronesis/prudentia* is an intellectual virtue.] 


> Let us say then, leaving unsolved problems behind us, that virtues are in general beneficial characteristics, and indeed ones that a human being needs to have, for his own sake and that of his fellows. This will not, however, take us far towards a definition of a virtue, since there are many other qualities of a man that may be similarly beneficial, as for instance bodily characteristics such as health and physical strength, and mental powers such as those of memory and concentration.[@foot2002virtues 4]


### Strength
So, what differentiates virtue from strength? At first glance, the answer seems to be something about the will; Foot thinks virtues are revealed not only by a person’s abilities but by his or her *intentions.* But what are intentions? Foot argues that the ‘will’ must be understood in its broadest sense, “to cover what is wished for as well as what is sought.”[@foot2002virtues 5] Intentions are not the *only* thing we judge, for a well-intentioned nincompoop who always harms when helping is rightly judged as deficient in virtue. Neither do we only judge the result of a person's action, for we sometimes exculpate a failing performance in part because the person *meant well*, though it also perhaps it the exculpation is called for because circumstances were not favorable, chances of success were low, etc. 

Foot attempts to capture the point that 

>In his novel A Single Pebble John Hersey describes such a man, speaking of a rescue in a swift flowing river:
>It was the head tracker's marvellous swift response that captured my admiration at first, his split second solicitousness when he heard a cry of pain, his finding in mid‐air, as it were, the only way to save the injured boy. But there was more to it than that. His action, which could not have been mulled over in his mind, showed a deep, (p.5) instinctive love of life, a compassion, an optimism, which made me feel very good.
>What this suggests is that a man's virtue may be judged by his innermost desires as well as by his intentions; and this fits with our idea that a virtue such as generosity lies as much in someone's attitudes as in his actions. Pleasure in the good fortune of others is, one thinks, the sign of a generous spirit; and small reactions of pleasure and displeasure often the surest signs of a man's moral disposition.[@foot2002virtues 5]


### Skill
What differentiates virtues from skills? Foot presents the puzzling thought that "in the matter of arts and skills... voluntary error is preferable to involuntary error, while in the matter of virtues... it is the reverse."[@foot2002virtues 7] The thought seems to be that deliberately erring in an art or skill is compatible with mastery, whereas deliberately erring in morality is still an error. 


#### Section II of Foot ####

Foot also argues that virtues are "corrective". That is, each one stands "at a point at which there is some temptation to be resisted or deficiency of motivation to be made good."[@foot2002virtues 8] In this discussion, she is illuminating a statement of Aristotle that "virtues are about what is difficult for men" and also objecting to a statement of Kant that *only* "actions done out of a sense of duty" have moral worth. Kant's happy philanthropist gets great pleasure out of helping others. Kant's dissonant conclusion is that such actions display no moral worth. 

Kant's error, according to Foot, is in failing to distinguish that which is "in accord" with virtue from that which is *virtuous* full stop. It may be, for example, that a novice tennis player makes an expert shot while remaining merely a novice. The hit is in accord with excellence but is not, in this case, an instance of excellence -- only beginner's luck. In her self-love example, Foot points out that there is no virtue required to eat one's breakfast and avoid danger, but there may sometimes be cases where self-love is a duty -- even a difficult, painful duty. She says, "sometimes it is what is owed to others that should keep a man from destroying himself, and then he may act out of a sense of duty."[@foot2002virtues 13] 

So the solution to the happy philanthropist problem is that if he really does have such a character as to be delighted helping others, he is morally praiseworthy *because he has worked to achieve that character*.  

She says: 

>For charity is, as we said, a virtue of attachment as well as action, and the sympathy that makes it easier to act with charity is part of the virtue. The man who acts charitably out of a sense of duty is not to be undervalued, but it is the other who most shows virtue and therefore to the other that most moral worth is attributed.[foot2002virtues 14]

Since charity is a "virtue of attachment" (I should say "affection"), the feelings of the philanthropist count in favor of proving the presence of a virtue. 

Of course, Foot allows that it may take greater virtue for a man to *persist* in his philanthropy *even when* it brings him no delight. 

>Only a detail of Kant's presentation of the case of the dutiful philanthropist tells on the other side. For what he actually said was that this man felt no sympathy and took no pleasure in the good of others because ‘his mind was clouded by some sorrow of his own’, and this is the kind of circumstance that increases the virtue that is needed if a man is to act well.

So virtues are indeed corrective of tempting vices and tempting moral errors. However, the presence of temptation is not a necessary condition for the presence of a virtue. 

#### Section III of Foot ####
Can virtue enable the more efficient achivement of ignoble aims? On the one hand, examples are easy to furnish: a murderer displays courage; a prude displays temperence. It seems commonsensical that whatever attributes we designate as courageous can be found in agents pursuing bad ends. On the other hand, the Aristotelian line excludes such a possibility by definition. Jonathan Sanford's recent monograph, *Before Virtue*, argues that Aristotle's doctrine is "ethics insists it is impossible to exercise any virtue, with the exception of technical skill, wrongly."[@sanford2015before 163] Foot attempts to do justice to both these concerns. The analogy is to poisons or solvents: 

>It is quite natural to say on occasion ‘P does not act as a poison here’ though P is a poison and it is P that is acting here. Similarly courage is not operating as a virtue when the murderer turns his courage, which is a virtue, to bad ends. Not surprisingly the resistance that some of us registered was not to the expression ‘the courage of the murderer’ or to the assertion that what he did ‘took courage’ but rather to the description of that action as an act of courage or a courageous act. It is not that the action could not be so described, but that the fact that courage does not here have its characteristic operation is a reason for finding the description strange.[@foot2002virtues 16]

An agent's commission of an otherwise virtuous action may be a mistake *for that agent* at that time. This may seem ad hoc, but we must remember that Foot is attempting to make space for the "commonsense" observation that some good traits operate to bad ends *within* the philosophically rigorous definition of virtue as beneficial. 

One objection Foot responds to is the worry some might have that she is saying *only* those who are completely virtuous are virtuous at all. She has two responses: wisdom always operates as a virtue. So we admire wisdom perhaps most of all. I would add that when we admire another virtue such as courage, or justice, or moderation, we are often admiring the *wisdom in* the courage, the justice, and the moderation. 

A second response, though, is that we do admire some who have only a subset of all the virtues: 

>There are some people who do possess all these virtues and who are loved and admired by all the world, as Pope John XXIII was loved and admired. Yet the fact is that many of us look up to some people whose chaotic lives contain rather little of wisdom or temperance, rather than to some others who possess these virtues. And while it may be that this is just romantic nonsense I suspect that it is not.[@foot2002virtues 17]

Even those whose overall life is a mish-mash of virtues and vices are admirable. My interpretation of this sentiment is that such are admirable insofar as they demonstrate some excellent qualities. 

## Natural Goodness ##

Foot argues that virtues are instances of 'natural goodness.' This is a powerful thesis that she defends at length in her 2001 monograph.[@foot2001natural] I would like to hazard a summary of the dialectic before offering responses. 

Foot is aware that her offering in *Natural Goodness* is "crude" in that she is aware it will offend the ears of some listeners. Her defense is the thought from Wittgenstein that often crude beginnings are a necessary start to something refined. 


### Re-thinking the fact/value split
She calls the inquiry a "fresh start." By this she means to do without several shaky assumptions of Moore and Hume. For example, Moore assumed that "good" was the ultimate predicate under review in ethics; but this is false. Statements like "pleasure is good" are not good paradigms for philosophical reflection. 

Contrast 'good' with other predicates like 'red' or 'beautiful.' In a statement such as 'the house is beautiful', the predicate 'beautiful' doesn't need a complement. The house is *beautiful* -- full stop. But 'good' (like 'useful') has a different logical function. 'The house is useful' does need a complement -- the house is useful *for a mom of six, or useful for an artist,* or what have you.  Similarly, 'good' always means *good for someone* or *for something.* 'Good' always needs a complement. 


### On practical rationality ###

Another false assumption "finds its deepest roots in David Hume..."[@footnatural 6] It is the premise of almost all non-cognitivist thinkers isa way of dividing facts from values, "that the meaning of moral terms was to be explained in terms of a speaker’s attitude, intentions, or state of mind. And this opened up a gap between moral judgments and assertions... Fact, complementary to assertion, had been distinguished from value, complementary to the expression of feeling, attitude, or commitment to action."[@footnatural 8] There is a real distinction in the offing, but it is not the distinction between facts and values; it is the distinction between practical and theoretical. 

>Their theories were devised to take account of something that really is a feature of moral judgment: the ‘action-guiding’ character of morality, which Hume had insisted on and taken as the foundation of his moral philosophy. Morality, Hume had said, is necessarily practical, serving to produce and prevent action, and I shall call this ‘Hume’s practicality requirement.’ Emotivism satisfies the requirement in the wrong way. (9). 

We might say some facts are "actionable", while others are not. That is, some facts are *reasons for action* while others are *reasons for belief*.  We can use different nouns for the same distinction: some values are reasons for action, but some are not. But this is just the age-old distinction between theoretical and practical faculties and between truth and goodness. Truth is that which is to be believed; goodness is that which is to be pursued. 

For example, the greenness of home-grown kale is reason to believe the leaves contain chlorophyll. The healthiness of home-grown kale is a reason to eat it. Some will object that "healthiness" is a value and so proves the point that facts are not values and values not facts. But this is mere circular reasoning. In normal conversation, the term 'healthy' is a straightforward descriptive adjective like 'green'. My dinner guests may dispute my enthusiastic assertion that home-grown kale is tasty, but they do not dispute my describing it as healthy, nor do they misunderstand and confuse my meaning. The doctrine that, despite all appearances to the contrary, evaluative terms "*really*" just express a speaker's subjective values is precisely the doctrine Foot (and I) would like to consign to the defendent's chair. 

To deny that moral judgments are action guiding would be clearly wrong. But she aims to capture this "practicality requirement" in a far different way.
Perhaps it is wrong also to think that only subjective states can be action-guiding; perhaps evaluative properties, too, can be action-guiding. 

### Lifeform specific facts: biology and value

What are the action-guiding facts in the case of natural goodness? Facts about humans and facts about objects in the world and facts about our relation to those objects.

Virtue ethicists like Philippa Foot, and Peter Geach before her, express their thesis in statements like "virtues are necessary for human beings." The kind of necessity invoked here is not a sui generis ethical necessity but an instance of a familiar kind. That is, virtues for humans are like stings for bees, swiftness for deer, solidarity for wolves; there is a fundamental parity between natural goodness in nonhumans and humans. The parity is due to a common (metaphysical) structure shared by all living things as such. When we observe and examine living things we rightly employ some shared categories and our conclusions rightly share a logical structure. 

What is the common structure? Every individual living being is a member of a species or life-form. And different life-forms are subject to different normative appraisals. 

Thompson's groundbreaking *Representation of Life* argues that "life" is a fundamental concept. "Life" is not, as it may seem to some, a property of some beings where being is the fundamental concept. 


Julia Annas says: 
>What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out…[@Annas 1996)(find book)





### 4. Immorality can be answered.



### 5. Virtues benefit their possessor by definition; but they can cause harm and suffering. ##

>Many of our modern suspicions can be put in the form of a dilemma. Either the theory's pivotal account of human nature (or characteristic human life) will be morally indeterminate, or it will not be objectively well‐founded. At best, an objectively well‐founded theory of human nature would support evaluations of the kind that we can make about tigers—that this one is a good or bad specimen, that that behaviour is abnormal. These judgements might be part of a theory of health, but our conception of morality resists the analogy with health, the reduction of evil to defect. (This resistance has something to do, I suspect, with a conception of free will that resists all forms of naturalism.) An objective account of human nature would imply, perhaps, that a good human life must be social in character. This implication will disqualify the sociopath but not the Hell's Angel. The contrast is revealing, for we tend to regard the sociopath not as evil but as beyond the pale of morality. On the other hand, if we enrich our conception of sociality to exclude Hell's Angels, the worry is that this conception will no longer ground moral judgement but rather express it.[@The Primacy of Character](citation needed)

Allen Thompson and others object that Foot’s theory problematically grounds ethical evaluations in straightforward biological or anthropological facts. Is this a problem? 



>The objection I think I understand and want to take seriously starts from the thought that in employing such notions as life and organism and life-form or species we introduce something foreign, in particular something ‘biological’, or crudely empirical, into the elements of ethical theory. Any such view, one thinks, must involve either a vulgar scientistic dissolution of the ethical, tending maybe toward an ‘evolutionary ethics’, or else the covert substitution of an outdated metaphysics for what we know to be empirical. Each path leads to its own absurdities. Together they may be thought to betray a yearning to view our practices ‘from outside’ or ‘from sideways on’ in hope perhaps of providing them with a foundation or an external grounding.[@thompson2008life]



Thompson, Allen, “Reconciling Themes in Neo-Aristotelian Meta-Ethics”, The Journal of Value Inquiry (2007) 41:245-263.


“However, she then turns to ask just how suitable the kind of natural facts characteristic of Foot’s account look, from within a developed space of reasons, for grounding the rational justification of morality. On her reading, the outlook is not good. But in her attempt to reconcile the apparently incommensurable views of these two neo-Aristotelians, Hursthouse pursues a laudable goal, since success here would contribute significantly to the appeal of their shared perspective. It would be significant to at least provide an outline for the reconciliation of two central Aristotelian themes, the role of human function and the role of a proper moral upbringing, in the rational justification of morality.”
Thompson’s essay adjudicates this issue: can natural facts be reasons for acting? The first answer is that yes, they can be reasons for acting without mediation through culture. The second answer is no: they can only be reasons for acting after proper mediation through culture, after being “imported” from bald nature into the space of reasons. 
Ferreira summarizes the two positions as “empirical naturalism” and “excellence naturalism.” [1] 
(Ferreira 2007)
What is wrong with empirical naturalism?
It cannot account for the enculturation of human values. Take for example the human practice of making and wearing clothing on top of our skin. Is this natural? On the one hand, it is clearly artificial. Beavers do not make, select, and wear their fur — it simply grows. Birds do not shop for new fashionable feathers. On the other hand, it is clearly natural. Ignoring speculative pre-historical history for the moment, the earliest archeological and written evidence tells about humans wearing clothing. We wear clothing “automatically.” But we make it from natural materials and wear or trade it “automatically.” So it is both natural and artificial. This is an acceptable introduction to the concept of second natural. For humans, clothes-wearing is second nature. 
What is wrong with excellence naturalism?
The remaining problem with excellence naturalism is… [ Review this article

Buhler Keith, 6/20/15, 8:16 AM]
Developing Foot’s ideas about natural normativity, Annas says this:
“What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already. It is part of the great merit of the work of Philippa Foot and Rosalind Hursthouse to have stressed this point. Like many important philosophical points, it is obvious once pointed out, but was rendered invisible for many decades by the ascendancy of non-naturalistic theories of ethical discourse. (Once we appreciate it, we can understand why those theories have been so barren of insight.)” (Annas 1996)

12. Some object that Foot is not clear (James Lenman, for example). This is not true; she is clear enough to expose the readers' modern prejudices. 


10. Some object that Foot is unclear across three levels: logic, language, and morality. This is somewhat true but drawing a clear distinction between the three need not suggest a sharp *division* between the three. 


### Not “naturalistic”

Many have complained that Foot’s neo-Aristotelian “naturalism” does not amount to a naturalistic theory. They object that Foot is not a "naturalist." 

“…we can see that Foot’s naturalism offers a fresh approach to objectivism in ethics. Yet, in spite of such attractions, *Natural Goodness* is in the midst of a cool reception. Here, I will argue that this reception is due to the fact that Foot’s naturalism draws on a picture of the biological world that is at odds with the view embraced by most contemporary scientists and philosophers. Foot’s readers commonly assume that the account of the biological world that she must want to adhere to, and that she nevertheless mistakenly departs from, is the account offered by contemporary neo-Darwinian biological sciences.”[@hacker2009natural 309]


### Reply -- misunderstanding

This is to misunderstand Foot and to beg the question as to what nature is. 

### Naturalism is a useless word

It is becoming more plain to anyone who reads the latest literature on "naturalism" that accusations from one philosopher to another that a theory fails to be "naturalistic" are vacuous. 

The noun 'Naturalism,' like the adjective, 'natural', is a cognate of 'nature.' Naturalism is an 'ism' attached to the most ambiguous word in our language: nature. But what is 'nature'? To say that various thinkers and various schools of thought defend non-identical definitions of nature would be an understatement. Various thinkers defend incompatible definitions. 

There are, by my count, no less than sixteen substantive philosophical positions that fly under the heading of 'naturalism', and they couldn't be more different: from Paul and Patricia Churchland's monistic physicalism, to John McDowell's "relaxed naturalism", to William James' neutral monism, to Thomas Aquinas' natural law theory, to Stoic pantheism, and more. Is there any question that these views are not just different but incompatible?  

Consider an example to see how the competing understandings of nature render discussion about whether "x is really naturalistic" almost meaningless. 

Suppose Bob thinks 'nature' is simply another word for the concept of 'all that which is', all of reality, being. Nature is everything. His colleague Bettie thinks 'nature' is a word that picks out something special, namely that part of 'all that is' that is cosmic, that part of reality that constitutes *this* world. For Bob, nature is being. For Bettie, nature is part of being. 

In a discussion one day, Bob says, "You know, Bettie, I attended a lecture on angels yesterday. Being a naturalist, I was interested in the nature of angels. I believe some real beings are not physical beings but intellectual or spiritual beings -- but what is their nature? The lecturer argued that they are intellectual substances or disembodied minds. I found that compelling." Bettie replies,  "I certainly agree that some real beings are not physical beings but intellectual or spiritual beings. But being a naturalist, I would not say angels have a 'nature' or any 'natural properties' since they are not physical. Rather, angels have an essence." 

Is there any question that a hard-nosed physicalist such as Frank Jackson or Alan Gibbard would have an aneurysm listening to this conversation? 

Their colleague, Charlie, agrees with Bob in thinking 'nature' is simply another word for the concept of 'all that which is', all of reality, being -- but he is a materialist.[^20] Naturally enough, he thinks "because I am a naturalist, I do not think angels are real beings and part of the global world order, since they are not physical. I probably would not attend a lecture on angels in the first place." Charlie might look cross-eyed at Bob and Bettie during their exchange; Bob and Bettie might look cross-eyed at him back. 

Bob accuses Charlie of being a non-naturalist. Why? Because Charlie denies part of reality. A true naturalist accepts all of reality, whether material or not. Charlie is a dogmatist about denying fairies, demons, gods, angels, ghosts, and any other purported being that has the gall not to be material; Bob is more ecumenical and can examine the evidence for each purported being as it comes. 

[^20]: I say "materialist" and not "physicalist" because "physis" is Greek for "nature" and so the problem iterates.

The point of these dialogues is this: The title 'naturalist' can, without contradiction, be claimed by Bob, Bettie, and Charlie. Each with a straight face owns the title, defends it against rivals, and criticizes the silly notions of their colleagues as "non-naturalistic." Bob is a non-naturalist to Bettie and Charlie because he thinks immaterial angels are part of nature, are members of the natural order. Bettie is a non-naturalist to Charlie because she thinks that angels exist above and beyond the material order. Charlie is a a non-naturalist to Bob because Charlie does not accept *all* of nature. 

This problem is iterative. It does no good to call Charlie a "physicalist" -- the term "physis" means "nature" so 'physicalist' is a Greek language version of the Latin language 'naturalist.' The question is whether angels have a *physis*. 

If the label is universally applicable, it is useless in the attempt to construct clear arguments with clear propositions. If it is useless for such purposes, it is *a fortiriori* pointless to use the term as an epithet of praise or blame. Yet despite this general conceptual anarchy, some philosophers emit the accusation of 'naturalism' or 'non-naturalism' as if uttering a curse. They seem to believe the sheer force of being called a naturalist or non-naturalist will melt their opponent's resolve and refute their position.

I should say that among the crew of naturalists like myself, it is perfectly well to point out that "that fellow over there is not a naturalist like us" -- as long as we can recognize that that fellow and his crew are pointing to me and saying "that fellow over there is not a naturalist like us." Our disagreement is real. But it is over what 'nature' consists in and not whether some view ought to be taxonomized in philosophy encyclopedias as a 'naturalistic' view or not. I cannot imagine any philosophical view whatsoever -- pansychism, Parmenidean monism, nihilism -- that cannot be presented (without contradiction) as a variety of naturalism. 

So what question should we ask about view X? We should ask what *kind* of naturalism X is. But this is the same as asking whether it is true or false. And that is a worthwhile question. 

### Fink on Nature

How many competing notions of nature are there? Roughly three that are important for philosphical purposes. 

Nature is all that is. 


### What if there are no ends in nature? ##

One powerful objection to the recovery of telos is that there is no teleology in nature. There are no *ends* (τελοι). Call this position *teleological nihilism.* There are two forms of teleological nihilism: extreme and moderate. Extreme teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no "purposes" or natural ends anywhere in the world *including* in human actions. Even our practices, behaviors, and lives are purposeless, even to ourselves. Moderate teleological nihilism we may call the view that there are no natural purposes *except* those in human actions, intentions, and societies, etc. On moderate teleological nihilism, human purposes are not instances of a broader category that includes the tendency of an acorn to become an oak and the tendency of deer to survive and reproduce; human purposes are sui generis phenomena that spontaneously emerge out of our brains at a certain level of complexity. Final causation thinking is then projected out onto the world by us; we observe that the beaver gathered wood and that the beaver built a dam and we say "the beaver gathered wood *in order to* build the dam." But really the beaver did no such thing. This is what philosopher of biology Ernst Mayr calls "teleonomic" natural behavior, but not genuinely teleological.[@mayr1992teleology] 

Teleological nihilism claims as its evidence *modern science* as a whole. Natural sciences have dismissed the notion of final causation for three or four centuries now and have gotten along well without it. In fact, natural sciences and the experimental, empirical methods that advance them have progressed far more than anyone could have dreamed. In part, this success is the result of giving up magical thinking. 

### What if ends are reducible? ###

Teleoreductionism has taken one of two popular forms: the first reduces 'teleonomic' (that is, apparently teleological) biological functions to causal contributions to a system and the second reduces teleonomic biological functions to naturally selected effects. A proponent of the first reduction is Donald Davidson; a proponent of the second is Ruth Millikan. 

### Reducible reply ###

Neither forms of 'teleoreduction' can account for the normativity of the biological function in question. If hearts simply cause %%

James Barham elaborates:

>I was aware of well-known criticisms of both of the then-current reductionist accounts of function: the "causal-role" theory and the Darwin-inspired "selected-effects" theory. In a nutshell, the problem is that neither theory can explain the normative character of biological processes in a coherent manner. (Biological processes are "normative" in the sense that they may either succeedor fail in fulfilling their functions.) With respect to the "causal-role" theory, there is no way to distinguish between functional and non-functional parts of a biological system without presupposing the normative character of the overall system as a whole -- which begs the question at issue.
>With respect to the "selected-effects" theory, the problem is that selection history is conceptually irrelevant to the identification of function. True, it has a role to play in explaining how present-day functions have come to exist. But selection history cannot possibly explain what it is about a biological process that constitutes it as a function. This is a logical point that Darwinists simply miss. The reason is that our concept of function in no way depends on evolutionary history. If it did, then biologists like Aristotle, Galen, Harvey, and innumerable others who lived long before Darwin would not have had the means to identify the functions of organs, which they of course did. Sometimes, they got it wrong, as when Aristotle placed the seat of perception and thought in the heart, instead of the brain (though some of his predecessors got it right). But Aristotle's mistake was due to his inadequate knowledge of physiology, not to his ignorance of evolution.

Millikan bites the bullet on this objection. She isn't trying to do "conceptual analysis" of the term 'function.' She is willing to admit that her concept of proper function only applies to functional objects with histories and that hypothetical counterexamples involving functional objects without histories prove that two objects with one and the same "*mark* of purposiveness" can have different functions.[

### Biological Teleology

Teleological realism in biology is making a come-back. There are those who protest teleological nihilism. Arnhart persuasively argues that teleology is assumed in medicine.[@arnhart1988] Zammito clarifies ongoing relevance in biology, since organisms seem to be intrinsically purposeful.[@zammito2006teleology]

In a series of important articles and books over the past decade or so, Bedau (1990, 1992a, 1992b, 1993), Cameron (2004), Christensen & Bickhard (2002), Jacobs (1986), Manning (1997), Maund (2000), McLaughlin (2001, 2009), Mossio et al. (2009), Mundale & Bechtel (1996), Nanay (2010), Nissen (1997), Perovic (2007), Walsh (2006), and Zammito (2006) have cast grave doubt on the coherence of any reductive analysis of function. Some of these authors (e.g., Jacobs, Maund, Zammito) call explicitly for a reconsideration of the possibility that teleological phenomena in biology might be both objectively real and irreducible. 

The very word 'teleology' is liable to sound quaint to modern ears. Barnham clarifes the range of terms that denote identical or similar concepts: 

>"By “teleology,” I have in mind such words and concepts as “purpose,” “end,” “goal,” “function,” “control,” and “regulation,” as well as the real- world biological phenomena to which these words and concepts refer. This means that the word “teleology” should always be construed here in its internal or “immanent” sense—purposiveness existing in living beings themselves—and never in its external or “transcendent” sense of an overarching cosmic principle" (Barnham 1). For a similar distinction, see Lennox (1992) and Brown (2001). 

We can add "purposive" and "goal-directed" to the constellation of concepts in the offing.

Introduction

Is normativity natural? Are normative facts part of nature?  In this paper, I make a brief case for an affirmative answer. 

In the first section, I present a presumptive argument for natural normativity. Normative truths can be expressed in Aristotelian Categorical statements of the form all A’s φ. The existence of natural normative facts is best explanation of two other natural facts, both wrapped up in apparent teleology or end-directed phenomena. 

In the second section, I present a battery of seemingly devastating objections to the existence of objective natural norms. Not only does one risk mockery when flying in the face of current philosophical orthodoxy, but some substantive scientific and philosophical objections seem devastating. I argue that these arguments against natural normativity persuade with suggestion more than substance. By contrast, the evidence for natural normativity is fairly obvious, and the traditional explanations can be articulated with a high degree of sophistication, coherence. 

In the third section, since my idiosyncratic interest in natural norms arises partly from my research in metaethics, I conclude by discussing one possible implication of natural normativity within ethical and metaethical conversations. 

In this paper, I draw from eclectic sources, but most from Aristotle, Philippa Foot, and Thomas Nagel. I take my readings of Aristotle and Nagel to be fairly standard; my reading of Foot, on the other hand, extends a bit farther into metaphysical speculation than she herself (following Wittgenstein) is interested in going. I take my thesis to be naturalistic in the broad sense: I am using philosophical and broadly scientific methods in an attempt to observe and explain natural phenomena, and bracketing divine revelation or the existence of supernatural beings. Furthermore, my thesis is naturalistic in that one important governing assumption of ethical naturalism is that humans are continuous with nature (Brown 2009). This naturalism I shall use to push back against one kind of objection. 


Norms
First, what is a normative fact? A normative fact “is what corresponds to a true normative statement” (Schaber). For reasons of space, I shall ask you to join me in simply assuming normative realism. So, value-statements, reason-statements, and ought-statements are refer to different norms. (I will use “norm” and “normative fact” interchangeably). “You ought not hit strangers with a skateboard” is a moral statement, but obviously, not every ought is a moral ought (Thomson 2001). “You ought to drink some hot lemonade” is a prudential norm (Thomson 2001). Drinking the hot lemonade is something you aspire to, rather than a description of how you are behaving. If you do not, your throat may remain sore. Importantly, not every norm uses the word ‘ought’. For example, “Eyes are for seeing,” is a description of their function, purpose, or the end-directed activity of that system. “Eyes are for seeing” is a normative and descriptive statement — that’s what eyes do and what they ought to do. Eyes that cannot see are defective qua eye. “Wolves hunt in packs” is a normative and descriptive statement. 


The basic thesis

So, the basic structure of the argument is this: there are two phenomena, two natural facts, that are best explained by the reality of natural normativity. If those two natural facts are real, then norms are part of nature, nature is normative. 

Consider those two natural facts: the first is end-directed (teleonomic) behavior of natural entities (eyes see, trees grow, stomachs digest); the second is the essentially normative (teleological) cognitive and practical activity of natural humans. The best explanation of each of these facts, and of both together, is that nature is normative.  By nature is normative, we could also say that there are natural teleological laws, natural norms, final causes, natural ends, natural functions. 

Aristotelian Categoricals 

“Wolves ought to hunt in packs” is a statement Foot calls an Aristotelian Categorical (Foot 2002). An Aristotelian categorical is a statement of logical form neither universal nor particular. That is, to assert that all A’s φ is not to distribute φ-ing to all members of the category A, nor simply to assert that some A’s that we have observed were observed φ-ing. 

For example, “all reptiles lay eggs” as universal categorical statement admits no exceptions.  The discovery of a new reptile, say, that gives live birth would not be the discovery of a defective reptile, but a discovery of a new species of reptile. Or rather, it would mean that either this newly discovered creature is not a reptile or that not all reptiles lay eggs. On the other hand, modestly confining oneself to a particular categorical statement like “some reptiles lay eggs” would be radically unambitious science. Our sample size of reptiles that lay eggs is enormous; we are justified in making the inductive leap that all reptiles lay eggs. 

Aristotelian Categoricals, then, are neither simply universal nor simply particular categorical descriptions. They are normative/descriptive judgments. And they are also formed by observation and induction. For example, we observe that many As do indeed φ, and we infer that A is supposed to φ, A is for φ-ing.  Categorical are inductive generalizations with a normative character.  We have observed a sample of A’s φ-ing and we inductively infer that (perhaps) all A’s φ. On the basis of the generalization, the observation that a particular A does not φ does not refute a simply, universal predication but identifies a defect in that particular A. When we observe an exception to a categorical we do not ipso fact debunk our categorical nor are obliged to re-interpret our observation. When learn that all wolves (say) hunt in packs, and observe a wolf hunting alone, we do not debunk the principle that wolves hunt in packs. (Nor do we think that we have discovered a new species of canine that is morphologically and genetically identical to a wolf!) Rather, we have observed that not all wolves are doing what they are supposed to do, not all wolves perfectly exemplify their lifeform.



A Presumptive Case for Natural Teleology

The presumptive case of natural teleology is this. 


   A. Argument for Normative Facts

   1) If a normative statement is true, it corresponds to a normative fact. (Normative realism)
   2) Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement. (From observation and induction). 
   3) Therefore, eyes are for seeing corresponds to a normative fact. (From 1-2)

   B. Argument for Natural Normative Facts. 

   1) Further, if a normative statement is true about natural entities, then there are natural normative facts. 
   2) Eyes are for seeing is a true normative statement about a natural entity. 
   3) Therefore, there are natural normative facts. 

Argument (A) assumes normative realism for premise 1.  We learn premise 2 from observation and induction: an Aristotelian Categorical descriptive/normative statement: Eyes are for seeing (stomachs are supposed to digest, wolves hunt in packs, humans ought to think rationally, or what have you). (I) delivers conclusion (3), that there are normative facts. Then, argument (B) provides a simple variation on (A). True normative statements about natural entities correspond to real natural facts. Such normative facts are natural and not merely human, psychological, or projected. And (2) is, I take it, obviously normative and about a natural entity (not something man-made). So (B) delivers our thesis, that there are natural normative facts. 

Objections: It seems that nature is not normative

Let’s consider just a few of the powerful objections to this line of thinking. 

   1. The first objection is that it is false that eyes are for seeing. Some will say, “Eyes that do not see died out; eyes that see were preserved naturally.” 
   2. 
   ⁃  As far as I can tell, evolutionary backstories about what eyes are and what eyes do has nothing to do with whether they have a real, end-directed function. There is disagreement about whether explanations undermines or underwrites teleological explanations (Brown 2009). All that I need for my argument to work is that possibly evolutionary backstories underwrite natural teleology. The only reason to assume that natural selection is undirected by natural teleology is dogma. If so, call me a heretic. 
   ⁃  
   ⁃  But is it really possible to doubt that eyes are for seeing? That eyes see is an empirical observation. That eyes ought to see, that eyes that cannot see are defective, is, I insist, equally empirical. It is just as empirical and no more theory-laden than other scientific observations like “all reptiles lay eggs.” 
   ⁃  
   ⁃  I save one more response to this objection in the last objection.
   ⁃  
   3. A second objection is to cling to an image. On one very powerful picture of the world, nature is a realm of pure descriptive facts. Nature is “bald”, “disenchanted,” and purely physical (McDowell 1996). Nature is an interlocking system of relations, spatial, temporal, and causal. Nature is “the world of quantity, as against the world of quality; of objects as against consciousness… of that which knows no values as against that which both has and perceives value; of efficient causes (or, in some modern systems, of no causality at all) as against final causes.” (Lewis 1943). Some call this the Laplacian picture (Plantinga 2011). On the Laplacian picture, norms are final causes, teloi, ways, and hence must be merely psychological. The Laplacian picture is the scientific picture of nature. So the assertion of norms is unscientific.  
   4. 
   ⁃  By all means, let us be scientific. I have an unwavering pro-attitude toward whatever earns the honorific title of science. If teleological laws are not discovered by scientific methods, then normative facts remain mere hypotheses or pragmatic assumptions or unshakable illusions. But the fact that eyes really are for seeing disproves the Laplacian picture of science. Natural normativity is scientific, and its denial is unscientific. It is empirical, and its denial is dogmatic.  
   ⁃  
   5. A third objection. The existence of natural teleology depends heavily on inferences to the best explanation. But “best” explanation depends in part on background beliefs. If one of our background beliefs is that we believe on good inductive evidence from scientific methods, that there are no natural norms, then appeal to normative facts to explain apparent normative truths like “eyes are for seeing” is blocked. So, on best scientific methods, we must deny the appearances: either normative realism is false, or normative natural facts are merely descriptive with the illusion of normativity. 
   6. 
   ⁃  By “scientific methods”  we mean one of two things: Firstly, when some people say “facts discovered by scientific methods” they do not mean a method at all but a doctrine, in this case, that normativity is not natural. But we can dismiss the dogma since I have given a case that, all things being equal, normative truths (described by Aristotelian Categoricals) are indeed apparently real and are indeed explained by inference to normative facts.  Or, secondly, some people mean by “scientific methods” those  that sometimes use the inference to the best explanation.  Scientists do use inference to the best explanation (abduction, hypotheses, explanation). It is a tool in the scientific tool belt. It is, in fact, ineliminable part of the scientific method. 
   ⁃  
   ⁃  And that is the kind of inference we used. The explanation of teleological phenomena (by teleological laws) may be wrong but it is not in the wrong ball park. It may be unscientific in the sense that any datum, theorem, proposition, law, or statement that turns out to be false is — ipso facto — unscientific. But it is not unscientific by being simply non-scientific, by being different from the scientific enterprise the way that street lights, rhetorical questions, and Cinderella movies are non-scientific. 
   ⁃  
   7. This is not strictly an objection: but someone might be thinking that the doctrine of natural norms is unpopular, and therefore probably false. If it were true, wouldn’t more scientists believe it? More philosophers of science? More philosophers? More people? My only response to this is that philosophical fashions come and go, and perhaps this particular fashion of denying teleology rests on a mistake; regardless, we can and should consider the argument on its own terms. I have argued that observing natural norms is an empirical business; who knows but that we may see natural normativity becomes the new, justified, scientific consensus? 
   8. 
   9. A fourth, very different objection. Suppose we grant that humans are supposed to think rationally is a norm, and a norm about human nature. We are, as a species, capable of advanced cognition and practice. (Those of us who think irrationally and act irrationally are, when we do so, defective.) So why not just explain the appearance of natural norms, of final causes, of purposes, of natural ends, by a combination natural selection and human projection? We are projecting our insides onto nature’s insides. When really, nature has no “inside,” no subjectivity, no consciousness. 
   10.   
   ⁃  Strangely enough, such an explanation divorces humanity from nature. It makes humans mysterious, radically discontinuous, opaque, anomalous, and queer. Since I am here assuming that humans are continuous with nature, I reject an account of teleology that makes it natural only to humans but unnatural to the cosmos as a whole. Furthermore, I have studiously avoided using too many uncontroversial examples of human normativity, preferring the more controversial (and hence more interesting) examples of non-human normative facts. 
   ⁃  
   11.   A fifth, and also very different objection. Stephen Brown objects that arguments from an observation that A φ’s to the conclusion that A ought to φ prove too much, since it can be applied not only to non-humans but to non-living things. For example, we could “prove” that our hydrogen star is for radiating energy to the earth; the sun engenders life so therefore it is supposed to engender life. But this seems absurd: tthe sun does not have a purpose, a natural normativity. This is an objection about scope: if there are norms in terrestrial nature, do they extend to the whole cosmos? My presumptive case argues are really real and really natural but may be taken to prove only that norms exist for organic natural entities.
   12.   
   ⁃  On the one hand, I am perfectly content to rest my case. If I have persuaded you of a more modest conclusions, that normative laws obtain only in humans; or they obtain only in living organisms, or even more ambitiously, that they obtain only in organic systems (both organisms and their organs). 
   ⁃  
   ⁃  On the other hand, Thomas Nagel (2012) makes the case in Mind and Cosmos that teleological (and hence normative) laws are natural to the cosmos as a whole, including inorganic matter. I think there are two good reasons to be maximally ambitious about natural normativity. They are both reductios: suppose that there are natural normative facts about only organic entities, not non-living entities like the soil and the sun. Then we must affirm that when life appeared on earth, a new kind of case appeared as well: final causes. A new natural fact that was never there before, normative natural facts appear. For 13 billion years prior, there was only chance and efficient/material causes. Suddenly, and accidentally, the universe produced not only a new entity but a new kind of fact: normative facts. This sounds to me absurd, though if it does not sound so to you, I’m not sure how to persuade you otherwise. It makes more sense, I think, to suppose that natural normativity was there from the Big Bang forward. A second reductio: In the first objection, we considered that natural selection undermines the appearance of teleology. The problem is that natural selection does not apply to inorganic entities and systems like the soil, the sun, and the stars. There is no interstellar process analogous to genetic drift and the extinction of maladaptive traits. This also sounds to me absurd. The alternative, then, is more likely true: natural norms just are features of all of nature. Teleological normative laws are another brute kind of natural laws. 
   ⁃  


Conclusion about Metaethics: Norms unite human nature and non-human nature

What is particularly exciting to me about natural normativity, if it is true, is its implication for ethics. I want to suggest, in closing, that the non-human stuff of the cosmos (quasars, deer, comets) and the human stuff of the cosmos (you and me) share a common structure, and that this underwrites many ethical claims. 

Descriptive natural laws describe formal relational structures at any given moment, a set of stable relations between natural entities; normative natural laws describe relational structures across time; a set of consistent end-directed relations between natural-things-as-they-are and natural things-as-they-ought-to-become. So the explanation for human end-directed behavior and non-human end-directed processes is the same: natural norms. 

Julia Annas puts it this way:  “What is so helpful for ethics from this kind of biological naturalism is that we find that the normativity of our ethical discourse is not something which emerges mysteriously with humans and can only be projected back, in an anthropomorphic way, onto trees and their roots. Rather, we find normativity in the realm of living things, plants and animals, already…” (Annas 1996). Natural normativity underwrites the belief that non-human nature and human nature share a common structure. This is just what ethical naturalism predicts. 

That structure is both formal and final, both descriptive and normative.  And discovering that structure is the joint task of philosophy (metaphysics) and science (the philosophy of nature), since experimental and theoretical methods are both fruitful. This is just what naturalism predicts. 

Ethical living is when we aim to become what we ought to become. Honesty, promise-keeping, rationality, prudence, moderation, perseverance, can be plausibly presented as traits that enable us to become what we are already are and what we ought to be.
