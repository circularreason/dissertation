\f0\fs28 \cf0 Moral nihilism is, in my view, not a respectable philosophical position but a cliff to push one\'92s opponents over. I borrow that delicious phrase from Daniel Dennet\'92s very different context. He was speaking of dualism. Nihilism is so radically implausible that except for the debonair amoralist like Callicles or Nietzsche or Zizek, it has few sophisticated adherents. The moral nihilist is the typically simply the careless, reckless, arrogant person. The amoralist is the immoral. }
