\f0\fs28 \cf0 Russ Shafer-Landau has become a go-to defender of moral non-naturalism. And moral non-naturalism needs defenders. Since G. E. Moore, it is hard to come up with one non-naturalist name (Robert Audi) to every five naturalist names (J. L. Mackie, Alan Gibbard, Richard Boyd, Peter Railton, Philippa Foot). \
And yet Shafer-Landau is explicit that the debate within metaphysics between naturalism and non-naturalism doesn\'92t amount to much. Non-reductive naturalists are, by his lights, virtually indistinguishable from non-naturalists. The taxonomy game devolves into a trivial debate over labels. (Here\'92s another interesting but ultimately trivial question: Should Montesquieu be classified as a political philosopher, a historian, a philosopher, a moral philosopher?) \
