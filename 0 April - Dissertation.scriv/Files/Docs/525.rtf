\f0\fs28 \cf0 	**Section 4** (How plausible is MacIntyre\'92s account of virtue?  In the final section, I shall carefully endorse part and reject part of MacIntyre's account.) \
\
For instance, I reject part of his notion that virtues are relative to changing traditions rather than a stable human nature. And I endorse the thesis that human practice is teleological and hence that non-teleological ethics are either false or (in the end) *actually* covertly teleological, but defer the question of the relationship between *social* teleology and *physical*,  biological, natural, or metaphysical teleology. \
