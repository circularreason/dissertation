Networking sub-project

Email Paul and Fred. "Hi Paul and Fred, hope you are well. I just wanted to let you know that I am a year or two away from apply for jobs after I finish my philosophy doctorate, and I intend to apply for Torrey. I am aware that the chances you all will need me are slim. The chances that Biola would allow an Orthodox on staff are slim. The chances of using precious hiring slots for a white male philosophy guy after you already have an amazing philosopher in Janelle Klaupauzsak."
