In Irrelevance, Pollyanna, and Good Vices, the norms putatively indicating what a virtuous human being is appear either irrelevant or positively vicious. We can only filter out vile norms by means of a prior evaluative judgment in favor of the sweet and sympathetic side of humanity. And where would this judgment come from? It would not come from an objective, scientific description but a normatively loaded  *ethical* judgment. So it would seem that the method of forming true ethical judgments is autonomous from the method of forming true descriptive, scientific judgments.

These objections together constitute pincer problem. 

On the one hand, the teleology of life (organic teleology) compels us to categorize injustice as a virtue or else to appeal to the practical, evaluative point of view; but the teleology of rational choice (social teleology) seems to force us to abandon the relevance of the teleology of life. 

Caught in this pincer, neo-Aristotelians must either bite the bullet and abandon organic naturalism, or embrace the absurd (or patently immoral) conclusion that some vices are good for us. Is there any way to escape the dilemma, or reconcile it? 



The success of the objection that objective values are not saliently different from other unobjectionable abstract entities or concepts like necessity or causation depends on the details. Russ Shafer-Landau[@shafer2003moralrealism], Terence Cuneo[@cuneo2007], David Enoch[@enoch2011taking] have each recently provided these details and shown (though I shall not try to show it here) that indeed objective values are not any more objectionable than other kinds of abstract objects. For example, Cuneo argues that whatever “objectionable features” moral norms display are also displayed *inter alia* by epistemic norms. If Mackie is an ‘epistemic skeptic’ then he must deny the intrinsic, categorical, reason-giving force of such epistemic value judgments as *you ought to believe whatever proposition is supported by the best evidence.* But to deny such epistemic reasons is absurd. 


Also, Mark Timmons has clarified one part of Mackie’s argument to be the worry that the supervenience of moral properties on non-moral properties (such as biological or psychological ones) is somehow mysterious.[@timmons1999morality] In response, Russ Shafer-Landau has offered compelling arguments that such supervenience is no more or less objectionable than the supervenience of higher-order natural properties (like life) on lower-order natural properties (like certain cellular or molecular structures).[@shafer2003moralrealism, chapter 4.]  (Shafer-Landau also critiques the Humean theory of psychology that underlies part of Mackie’s worry about queerness.^[@shafer2003moralrealism, chapter 5.])


## For Chapter 7 conclusions?

The question of how to live, and of how to resolve pressing moral disputes and dramatic moral conundrums, is not easy. There are many answers, and people disagree. Anyone who has long engaged in dialectical disputes over the various answer to the normative question of how to live well eventually comes to ask a secondary question: is there even any truth to be found? Are there any ‘right answers’ in ethics? Is there anything to all this discussion besides gas? Some worry that ethics has no ‘right answers’ because it is all just intuition-pumping. Some people view ethics as too easy because it is only a discussion of one’s opinion.  We must admit that normative ethical conclusions — whatever conclusions satisfy us at the end of a long philosophical discussion about what is good and right — are different from conclusions in paleontology, medicine, or calculus. What does the difference amount to? Why is ethics *as a discipline* so different from, say, natural sciences? 

There are two sorts of interpretations of ethics as a discipline in light of the diversity of answers to the question about how to live well. The first is Hume’s answer, that ethics is “easy” (while metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophical anthropology are presumably difficult). 

The second is Aristotle’s, that ethics is *a different sort of science* because it has a *different subject matter* to which it must correspond. He says, “For a well schooled man searches for that degree of precision in each kind of study which the nature of the subject at hand admits: is obviously just as foolish to accept arguments of probability from a mathematician has to demand strict demonstrations from an orator.” [@aristotle Book I.3]

By the traditional classification, ethics is a form of philosophy. Russ Shafer-Landau persuasively argues this simple equation in defense of moral realism[@shafer2007foundations ethics] but the point has broader import. If ethics is *not* a species of philosophy, it is something else entirely. Perhaps it is a species of psychology, politics, or evolutionary anthrpology. Such a categorization assumes, at the outset, that power prevails over truth. But to concede that there are no right answers in ethics, that ethical philosophers have no hope of finding any ethical truth is to give up on ethics as a discipline. 

So suppose ethics is a species of philosophy, as Shafer-Landau argues.[@shafer2012ethics] Then the the fate of ethical theories hangs on the fate of philosophical claims and theories as a whole. If we are philosophical optimists at all — if we are not total skeptics or nihilists — then we can be ethical optimists. 

So what species of philosophy is ethics? If philosophy is its genus, what is its differentia? As I have been arguing, ethics is the discipline of practical reason. There are right answers in ethics since there are right ways to live one’s life, there are wells to live well and ways to live poorly; things can go well or badly for us. One of the fundamental governing assumptions of this work is that there is no special domain of the moral. Value theory is a whole package. There is at bottom no intelligible distinction between morality and prudence. 


## Also for conclusion?

One of the great attractions of recent neo-Aristotelianism is that that they aim to provide a unified solution to multiple interesting puzzles in metaethics, ethics, philosophy of science, philosophy of action, and others. 


## For chapter 6?

McDowell ignores that even "non-rational" phenomena such as emotions and even the human body can be made "rational" in the sense that one can and must take these into account when reasoning about what to do. 



## Subjectivism

I have been talking as if "reasons for action" are "out there" and identifiable. 

A subjectivist would argue that the Frey's "practical order" is not really an order "out there" in the world but an order "in here" in the human minds and human  psychology. For example, suppose my friend has lost his job and so I pay for his lunch. Clearly, "my friend lost his job" is a factual judgment I affirm as true. Something else is occurring, though, when I take it as a reason to buy my friend lunch. That "something else" is most simply explained as a motivation or disposition *within me* to take good care of my friends. 


Subjectivism is motivated by considering a problem about the status of practical reasons within (a broadly-construed) naturalism. As Simon Blackburn summarizes, naturalism asks:

>... No more of the world than we already know is there—the ordinary features of things on the basis of which we make decisions about them, like or dislike them, fear them and avoid them, desire them and seek them out. It asks no more than this: a natural world, and patterns of reaction to it.[@blackburn1985spreading] 

Along the same lines, Alan Gibbard argues that "Nothing in a plausible, naturalistic picture of our place in the universe requires ...  non-natural facts and these powers of non-sensory apprehension"[@gibbard1992wise 154]

Anti-realism broadly construed comes in a variety of forms: non-cognitivist subjectivism, cognitivist subjectivism, constructivism, and so on. One currently popular approach is non-cognitivist (or non-descriptivist) expressivism: 

>Expressivism in this form suggests a naturalistic interpretation of practical reason, one that may seem appropriate to the enlightened commitments of the modern scientific world view. It is naturalistic metaphysically, insofar as it makes no commitment to the objective existence in the world of such allegedly questionable entities as values, norms, or reasons for action.[@seppracticalreason]

What each of these quite disparate views share in common is a denial of robust realism. Jay Wallace explains such realism as follows: 

>The basic commitment of realism in this domain is the idea that there are facts of the matter about what we have reason to do that are prior to and independent of our deliberations, to which those deliberations are ultimately answerable. Realists picture practical reason as a capacity for reflection about an objective body of normative truths regarding action (Parfit 2011, Scanlon 2014).[@seppracticalreason, section 2]

For thinkers like Thomas Nagel, subjectivism would then include the straightforward projectivism of Mackie for whom moral values seem objective only because we "project" our deepest feelings and valuings onto the world but also the subtle social constructivism of McDowell for whom the moral law is real only because we legislate it, binding because we bind ourselves to it. 

Realism about practical reasons is what Nagel calls a "defeasible presumption."[@nagel1989view 143] First, pre-reflectively, most of us have no objection to the seeming fact that some reasons for acting are good reasons, and others bad. It is not only fundamental normative facts, such as that is wrong torture animals, that have a quasi-analytic force to them. Fundamental prudential facts such as that *it is wise to plan ahead* seem just as strong. Even the advocate of a procedural view of practical reason has to admit that there is a fundamental norm that *one is not to use ineffective means to achieve one's ends.* 

Secondly, even anti-realism's most sophisticated advocates concede the that realism is the default view. For example, John Mackie admits that "the main tradition of European moral philosophy” accepts objective values. He even admits that moral thought and language assumes it: the notion of objective value has  “a firm basis in ordinary thought, and even in the meanings of moral terms."[^52] Alan Gibbard likewise says, "Normative language does involve claims to objectivity in some sense—that seems clear enough."[@gibbard1992wise 154] Gibbard goes so far as to say that platonism about reasons is common sense.[^53]

Appearances suggest that values are indeed part of the “fabric of the world”; that they are categorically obligating and motivating; and that being a moral person in part is constituted by the recognition and proper response to such values.   

[^52]: Compare with @cuneo2014speech. 

[^53]: "It might be thought that ordinary conceptions of rationality are Platonistic or intuitionistic. On the Platonistic picture, among the facts of the world are facts of what is rational and what is not. A person of normal mental powers can discern these facts. Judgments of rationality are thus straightforward apprehensions of fact, not through sense per- ception but through a mental faculty analogous to sense perception. When a person claims authority to pronounce on what is rational, he must base his claim on this power of apprehension."
