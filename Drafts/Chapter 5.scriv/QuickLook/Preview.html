<br/>
Jay Wallace defines practical reason generally enough for us to use his definition as a starting point: "Practical reason is the general human capacity for resolving, through reflection, the question of what one is to do."[@seppracticalreason] We practically reason generally about how to live, and specifically about what to do. We do this by reflecting on action, by evaluating good and bad, and by identifying *practical reasons* -- that is, reasons to φ or not to φ....</p>

<br/>
In order to address these questions, I would like to explore McDowell's account of virtue as knowledge. His first claim is that the "point of engaging in ethical reflection... lies in the interest of the question 'How should one live?'"[@mcdowell1979virtue 331] <br/>
<br/>
Before we look at McDowell's answer, let's frame the discussion. <br/>

What is required is a step back to examine the natural of practical reasons themselves and how they relate to practical reasoning in general. I would like to argue that there is one genus of reasons for action: practical reasons. There are many species of practical reason, but proper distinction is not between "moral" and "non-moral" but between various kinds of moral reasons. <br/>

<br/>
McDowell argues that the virtues are various "sensitivities" to the salient facts about how to live. Virtue is a kind of knowledge, namely *practical knowledge* (a “disposition to act well”).  The answer to "how?" questions is an item of knowledge. "How do I unscrew a light bulb?" is a request for an instruction ("twist left") or set of instructions, ("first, grip the light bulb; then twist left until it comes loose."). The answer to the question of how to live...</p>

The objection familiarly attributed to Hume is that practical reasons by themselves cannot motivate, at least not by themselves. If this were so, moral reasons could not satisfy the "practical requirement". Expressivism is motivated in large part by the attempt to satisfy the *practical* dimension of practical reason (at the cost of the "rational" part). <br/>

The strength of this picture of practical reason is what some will consider a weakness. On this picture, practical reasoning is not just a procedural process, but a substantive one. That is, we do not reason about means solely, but also about ends. Indeed, on this picture, practical reasoning is defined as an orientation to practice in pursuit of apparent goods and in avoidance of apparent evils. As Aquinas says, "This is the first precept of [pract...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>## Conclusion </strong><br/>## Conclusion<br/>
<br/>
In this chapter, I have argued that practical reason is both practical and rational; it is both a kind of knowledge and a definitionally motivating or action-guiding kind of knowledge. Namely, practical reasoning is the process of evaluating and pursuing the good and evaluating and avoiding the bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The term "moral reasons" is used in two very different ways. First, it is used to refer to practical reasons as a whole, the pursuit of the good. And secondly, it is used to refer to...</p>

<br/>
The remaining tasks are three: first, we must understand this process in light of our human telos. Second, we must understand it in light of the inherently social nature of rationality. <br/>
<br/>
And third, we must return to the question of organic naturalism to understand the process of practical reasoning in light of our animal nature and our place in the biological and physical order. Wallace and McDowell both help us to see the importance of identifying our ...</p>

Another solution to the problem of moral relativism. I call this phenomenon moral awe. Moral awe is the feeling that arises upon witnessing someone exhibiting heroic virtue. It is something beyond moral approval or admiration, which one may feel even for "small victories" such as, say, when a child decides (against all odds) to share a toy on their on volition. Moral approval is not, on the whole, a destabilizing emotion. One can experience moral approvals and disapprovals by the ...</p>

Relatedly, David Enoch's recent volume *Taking Morality Seriously* builds a case for moral realism on the basis that moral realism is the best explanation for the moral earnestness which most of us *cannot but help feel*.[@enoch2011taking] <br/>
<br/>
Thomas Nagel takes "the realist position... that our responses try to reflect the evaluative truth and can be correct or incorrect by reference to it."[@nagel2012mind 98-99; cf. @nagel1980ethics] That o...</p>

Two related problems remain. The first is called the "Irrelevance" problem; the second is the "Polyanna" problem. (A third problem will be addressed in a later chapter.) Let's state each problem in a bit more detail. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Being a bearer of the human life form means each of us is subject to the needs of food, shelter, and community like any other animal. Thus far, I have argued that these needs are natural norms. But the objec...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>## Practical Reason and knowledge </strong><br/>## Introduction to this chapter<br/>
<br/>
In developing an account of practical reason, there are two related problems we must address. Is practical reason both *practical* and *rational*? If practical reason is really practical, then how is it rational? And if it is rational, how is it really practical? In other words, suppose that practical reasoning is by definition a kind of knowledge. Knowledge is theoretical, it aims to grasp what is true. So the first problem is that theoretical knowledge cannot (...</p>

10. Is it a moral or intellectual virtue? Both. <br/>
