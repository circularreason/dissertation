## Nature and Ethics 

In Aristotle's day, there was no assumed divide between nature and normativity. Where modern thought is so often characterized by fundamental dualisms (mind/matter, nature/normativity, self/other, science/ethics), the worldview of Aristotle and even Plato could account for distinction without division and union without confusion. John McDowell cites this "anti-dualism" or original unity as one of the benefits of studying Greek thought. He does not quite go in for the particulars of Greek anti-dualism, because he thinks certain aspects of Aristotle's worldview are outmoded by modern science, but he thinks that studying such a holistic worldview can be therapeutic to the dualistic tendencies of us moderns.

Nowhere is the modern addiction to dualisms more clear than in science and ethics. Ethics is, if nothing else, the domain of the normative. The good and bad, the desirable and despicable, the worthy and unworthy are "fraught with ought." Nature, on the other hand, is the domain of the descriptive. And, for many thinkers, never the twain shall meet. 

The dualism between nature and normativity has consequences that are not merely unfortunate but, I think, disastrous. It forces us to decide between affirming a real but "non-natural" normativity or natural but ultimately unreal normativity -- it forces us to embrace *either* that the natural world described by sciences *or* the moral world described by common sense and (realist) philosophical ethics. This is a damnable dilemma. 

Let me state the dilemma in a bit more detail. Compare two stories that two philosophers might tell, and how they relate (or fail to relate) to the other story. First, a virtue ethicist is likely to tell the kind of story that indicates the kind of person I *ought* to become or avoid becoming, and the kinds of things *I ought* to pursue (like friendship) or avoid (like ignorance and intolerance). David Copp summarizes: 

>It is widely agreed that a virtue is a trait of character. Michael Slote says that an individual virtue is conceived as “an inner trait or disposition of the individual.” Rosalind Hursthouse has attempted to articulate in detail what such a trait would consist in. The key point, in her view, seems to be that a virtue is not merely a disposition to act in certain characteristic ways. To be sure, a virtue does lead one to act in characteristic ways, but beyond this, it leads one to act in such ways for characteristic reasons and in a characteristic manner, to have certain characteristic attitudes and emotions, to be acute in detecting cases in which the virtue is at issue, and so on.[@copp2004morality 516]

Hence, a virtue ethicist is likely to commend certain traits of mind and character as constituting a truly human and truly worthwhile life. Such traits might include wisdom, courage, and patience. Oddly enough, the longer one listens to a virtue ethicist, the less one thinks such traits are *natural*. High ethical aspirations come to sound far-off, perhaps almost other-worldly. Even if we go in for the high calling of becoming virtuous, we wonder what morality has to do with human nature.

Secondly, a scientific naturalist is going to tell a story in which that ambiguous word "nature" just means *everything that is the case* -- or perhaps, everything that is the case and that can be studied using the whole suite of methods belonging various scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry, evolutionary biology, and so on. A scientific naturalist prizes observation, empirical hypotheses, and empirical testing above all else. Hence, the scientific naturalist's attitude toward "human things" is likely to be ambivalent. Sociology, psychology, religion, mythology, literature, anthropology, and history all fall under a kind of vaguely-felt suspicion. When compared to the cold, hard clarity of mathematical nature, humans are embarrassingly warm, soft, and fuzzy. People's behavior can be quantified and recorded but people themselves are either too complex or too crazy to be captured in a scientific account quite as neatly as Red Giant stars or oceanic phytoplankton. At best, psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists can offer interpretations based on extensive observation of human subjects. 

There is an assumed divide between humans and the rest of nature. Are humans natural? If not, then what are we? If so, then why is it so especially tricky to understand ourselves. 

The ethical naturalist enters the conversation at this juncture with a fascinating suggestion: perhaps human beings are animals of a peculiar sort. Human beings are distinguished by their powers of reasoning but remain fundamentally continuous with the rest of the items on the cosmic inventory list. Hence, even though the normative domain is human it need not be *exclusively* human. 

Is it possible to be an ethical naturalist? Is it possible to break down the prejudicial divide between non-natural norms and non-ethical nature? Many neo-Aristotelian writers answer a definitive *'Yes'*. It is possible to be an ethical naturalist; it is possible to develop a plausible account that includes both our best scientific understanding of what *humanity is* along with our best ethical understanding of what *human beings can and ought to become*. This dissertation moves toward that goal. 

## My View

This dissertation argues that human virtues are excellences of practical reasoning and rational practice that enable and partly constitute the realization of one's human telos. 

Essentially, I argue that there are three points on the "virtue triangle" that are all necessary for developing a coherent and comprehensive ethical naturalism.

The three concepts that cannot be disentangled are these: human nature, human excellence, and natural teleology. The unifying concept at the root of these three is the concept of practical reason. Human nature is to be a practical reasoning primate. Human excellence is practically reasoning *well*, thus acquiring practical wisdom. And our natural telos is to become wise and to live the kind of life the wise person lives, in the face of the temptation of pleasing but ultimately destructive vice, and in the face of the inevitable death that comes along with being an animal living on earth. 

My thesis is that human beings *are* practical rational primates and hence *ought* to become fully mature such animals by acquiring the virtues and especially practical wisdom. 


## Chapter Outline

Chapter 2 argues that nature is normative. If some normative facts are natural facts, then it might be that some "facts" of human nature are fundamentally normative facts. 

Chapter 3 argues that human nature is normative. Indeed, some fundamentally normative facts about humans -- or human norms -- obtain in each member of the species. Hence, it is plausible to suppose that the person who fulfills such norms is both naturally human and ethically admirable. 

Chapter 4 argues that virtues are those qualities of human beings that enable and partly constitute our species-specific flourishing. Virtues are *what human beings are like* in virtue of their life form, and enable human beings to *become what they are*. 

Chapter 5 argues that practical reasoning is the process of identifying what is good for humans, and identifying how to live. Successful practical reasoning, hence, is necessary for becoming virtuous. 

Chapter 6 argues that the foregoing account is naturalistic by defeating a widely accepted, but un-scientific, picture of nature according to which normativity is excluded by definition.
