# Abstract

\thispagestyle{empty}


ABSTRACT: Neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism must give an account of each interlocking concepts that constitute a complete ethics and metaethics: virtue, practical reason, human nature, and human flourishing. It must explain how ethical naturalism is both naturalistic (accurately descriptive of the way things *are*) as well as genuinely ethical and normative (giving guidance on the way things ought to be). This dissertation offers such an account.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

\end{center}

My thanks are owed to many people. Dr. David Bradshaw has been a teacher, mentor, and trusty guide from the beginning to end. Heraclitus says, "All things arise by strife", in which case Anita Superson has helped this project to arise. Dr. Gary Hartenburg's timely counsel helped me actually get in to graduate school, while Dr. John Mark Reynolds first encouraged me to become a philosopher. Dr. Alfred Geier became my intellectual godfather and guided me in the dialectic. Dr. Timothy Sundell pushed me to research in metaethics and although he moved on to greater things before the completion of this dissertation, I am grateful for his early advocacy. I was happy to discover that I have justified the suspicions of my late father, Dr. Rich Buhler, who secretly spread rumors that I would be the first person in the family with an earned doctorate. Dan Sheffler trained me, like his father trained him, in the ways of programming LaTeX; it is possible to learn this power, but not from a Jedi. The University of Kentucky Graduate School hosted a writing "boot camp" which helped people like me to focus and write intensively. The United Way of the Blue Grass "Back on Track" Program purchased me a laptop computer and thousands of dollars worth of books and supplies.
