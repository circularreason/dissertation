\f0\fs28 \cf0 Suppose that modernity is a moral disaster. \
MacIntyre explains the present disastrous state of things through the modern rejection of telos. Teleological nihilism as we might call the view that there are no real, natural teloi. There may be teloi but they are all features of 
\i us, 
\i0 not features of the external world. They may be psychological projections upon the world that appear incorrigibly to be features of the real, natural world. But reflection can, somehow, expose this appearance as illusion. \
The recovery of telos, Taylor points out, may be undertaken in one of two ways. Both ways fundamentally agree with MacIntyre\'92s diagnosis of modernity and agree with the prognosis that we must recovery our belief \'97 acknowledgment of \'97 teloi. }
