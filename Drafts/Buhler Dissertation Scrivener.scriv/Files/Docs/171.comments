\f0\fs28 \cf0 From the graduate school: 	A bibliography is a comprehensive list of all sources used in the preparation of a dissertation, whether those sources are cited or not. References are those works cited in the text, including traditional footnotes and parenthetical citations. Either option is acceptable to The Graduate School. Bibliographies must be alphabetized even within sub-headings if used. References may be listed either alphabetically or numerically (in order of citation).  \
