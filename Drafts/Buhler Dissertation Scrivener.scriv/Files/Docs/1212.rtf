\f0\fs28 \cf0 One familiar and influential way of framing the "how should one live?" question is this: There are two sorts of motives that drive everyone. They are *prudential* reasons and *moral* reasons. Prudential reasons incline one to look out for oneself while moral reasons compel one to look out for others. We are all naturally, selfishly inclined to pursue our own happiness or well-being. And yet we are all morally constrained to do our duty. \
