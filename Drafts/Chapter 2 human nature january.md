#Chapter 2. Virtues are Traits Humans as Practical Reasoners Need 

"Man alone of the animals possesses speech." (Aristotle, *Politics*, 1.1253a)

## Introduction

Peter Geach says that virtues are necessary for humans as stings are necessary for bees.[@geach1977virtues] Philippa Foot echoes these statements about "need" and "necessity" as well. Alasdair MacIntyre subtitled his most recent monograph: "human beings need the virtues."[@macintyre1999dependent] For *whom* are virtues necessary? The answer is that virtues are needed for human beings as such. Virtues are those qualities needed by us as members of the human species, each exemplifying human nature. But what is human nature? The jumping off point of this inquiry into virtue is simply this: Are virtues necessary for human beings as such? I shall argue that virtues are deontically necessary for the realization of our human *telos*. 

## Apply Generics to Humans

We saw in the last chapter how, in outline, an ethical theory might ground normative facts in natural, teleological facts. Against the alleged impossibility of deriving an ought from an is, we saw how we can derive an ought from a functional or teleology 'is'. And, we argued, some natural facts are not purely descriptive. 

This strategy will be used to ground ethical facts in human nature. Now we must go further and specify what kind of life it is we as human beings live arising from what kind of creatures we are. Of course, the difficulty comes in attempting to move from such vague statements to particular moral statements: 'Human beings make and keep promises.' This will give us initial insight into the concept of virtue, which is our main theme. The subsequent chapters will provide more detail into the nature of virtue. 

## Applying generics

A powerful (if vague) Darwinian objection from metaphysics that there is no such thing as a biological “nature” anyway.[@hursthouse1998 chapter %%; @brown2008 chapter 5] 

Part of the skepticism from analytic philosophers to the neo-Aristotelian project stems, I think, from this worry. Yet, by the same token, part of the appeal of the neo-Aristotelian project is a clear concept of nature that applies to both humans and other animals. 

A nature is an abstract property. It is a set of capacities delimiting the range of potentialities of a given object or living being. The concrete blue-footed boobie is not a nature, but exemplifies the nature of blue-footed boobies. 

Natures, as we shall see, is an empirically discovered and inductively generalized set of potentialities latent in a species. Human nature is a set of potentialities to realize our animal and intellectual activities, including reproduction, metabolisis, rational choice, abstract reflection, and so on. 


## Applying generics

The first step in the argument is to apply what we said to human beings. What are human beings?  Humans are natural entities about whom generic, teleological statements are true and can be used as the basis of evaluative truths. 

Now, by calling humans 'natural' I do not mean to invoke here all the controversies surrounding the word. For now, calling us 'natural' is an innocent truism. Are we here, in nature? Yes. Are we material -- not necessarily *wholly* material, but are we *at least* material at all? Yes. Do we eat food grown on earth, drink water from the earth, are we born from fellow humans and do we die and disintegrate into the earth like every other living thing? Yes. So we are natural. Again, I do not mean to prejudge the question of whether we are *also more than natural*. I simply mean to invoke the obvious that the *we are at least natural*. Since we are (at least) natural entities, and since scientific statements are about natural entities, then it is possible (and indeed quite common) to make scientific statements about us. 'Humans emigrated from Africa about 200,000 years ago' is a statement about a natural species group, namely *homo sapiens sapiens*, the only extant members of the hominin clade. 'Humans are language users' is a generic scientific statement.

## Details about Human Nature

What is human nature? In short, we don’t know. Aristotle taught that humans are "political" animals by nature (that is, living in society). 

For all we can tell (without the benefit of divine revelation) humanity is an anomaly. Our origin is shrouded in mystery, our destiny undecided. The story we are told in biology and anthropology textbooks is that 200,000 years ago, hominids somehow developed new cognitive abilities sufficient to justify calling one or a set of these creatures “the first humans.” Our earliest direct, archaeological evidence of our ancestors is that they were artists: paintings adorn the caves of France. 

The evidence of recorded histories from Babylon, China, and Egypt tell a story of humanity already busied with architecture, science, imperial politics, and bustling with trade, culture, language, and art. The student of human nature ought to be a historian. To pursue my theme, we must move on. 

If our deep origins are shrouded in mystery, our future destiny is relatively clear. By any account, our species is doomed.  The science fiction dream of off-world colonies is most likely just a dream: no livable other planet has been discovered within our solar system or any of the surrounding regions. Even if one were discovered further out, along concentric circles each light years in diameter, the practical limitations on space travel for large numbers across unimaginable distances render off-world colonization virtually impossible. The only possibility left, itself highly impracticable, seems to me that scientific technology advances to a point that we can conceivably *create* an atmosphere on a planet that does not currently have one. 

Regardless of these dreams, if our current planet does not go into an ice age, or a dust bowl, or become a nuclear wasteland, or if a volcanic canopy does not eliminate conditions for organic life, then *eventually* the running down of our sun will condemn our species to the same fate of 99% of all species that have existed up until now: extinction.

## Human nature is to be rational

Bertrand Russell's famous essay "Free Man's Worship" poetically describes the cold, hard, reality of the natural destiny of the human species: 

>That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins--all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built.

Russell sees two possible structure that can be built on the "firm foundation of unyielding despair." The first is to worship power (which is the choice of slaves) and the second is, even in the face of death and annihilation, to worship ideals of truth and goodness (which is the choice of the free). The freedom and nobility of humanity lies in our cognition, even our recognition that we are slaves. He continues:

>The life of Man, viewed outwardly, is but a small thing in comparison with the forces of Nature. The slave is doomed to worship Time and Fate and Death, because they are greater than anything he finds in himself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour. But, great as they are, to think of them greatly, to feel their passionless splendour, is greater still. And such thought makes us free men... To abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things--this is emancipation, and this is the free man's worship.

Russell points to the noble impulse to cultivate our rational capacities in the light of our impending doom. 

1. Human nature is to be a rational animal. In the old classificatory schemes, philosophers provided a genus and a differentia. We can locate ourselves as animals in the phylum chordata, the class mammalia, the order of primates, the suborder haplorhini, the familiy hominidae, the genus homo, the species homo sapiens. What is our differentia? In a word, reason, or rationality. 
2. What are our rational capacities? First, speech.[@deacon1998symbolic] We are speaking animals. But through speech comes a whole second cosmos of culture. Through speech comes intentionality in all its forms. Through speech comes communication ("pass the salt"), distinct languages and cultures (about 5,000 distinct languages), self-consciousness ("who am I?"), abstraction ("all grass is green"), science, philosophy, religion, mythology, technology and more. Perhaps even art and music arise from the rational capacity to direct our actions to create not only what instinct demands but whatever the imagination can invent.[@orians2008nature. Orians says that "Americans spend more money on music than on sex or prescription drugs."] 
3. Rationality is also the capacity to judge true and false, to affirm and deny. This is the view of Aristotle and the neo-Aristotelians (among others). Rational capacities are identified by the actions of rational creatures. As Haldane says, quoting the medieval scholastics, "acting follows being" and "things are specified by their power."[@haldane1998return 262] We just do deliberate, explain, propose theories, judge truth and falsity, wonder, inquire, and so on. As far as recorded history goes, we have always done these things. 
4. While I shall have to say more about practical rationality in a future chapter, here I need only to specify that our nature as rational animals *includes* the notion that we are practically rational animals. Practical rationality is the capacity to judge what is good or bad, what is to-be-pursued or to-be-avoided. It is still *rationality* since the questions of what is good admit of true and false answers. They often require reflecting on what was is will be might be or must be best. Humean psychology paints human psychology as two non-overlapping magisteria, an entirely non-rational set of passions and an entirely non-passional rationality. Reason is not impractical, it is not merely theoretical. Reason can be and is also practical; thought results in practice. Practical rationality is not merely irrational. Some emotions "make sense" given the situation. John McDowell argues that, for example, danger makes sense to feel in the presence of a wild bear in the woods.[@mcdowell1988values] Disgust in response to some human bodily functions is apt; awe and wonder in response to viewing the starry heavens is apt.[@gibbard1992wise] Pain is not only painful but *bad*; pleasure is, in moderation, not only pleasant but *good*.[@nagel1980ethics] To borrow Gibbard's phrase, practical rationality is a capacity for *thinking what to do*.  Motivation, most broadly, is necessarily related to reasons one discovers and endorses, especially reasons that count in favor of an action or attitude, all things considered.

## Virtues are necessary for practical reasoners

So let us apply the conceptual structure we outlined in the previous chapter to human beings. We first, let us remember, abstract generic truths about the nature of a class of living thing, from which we can evaluate individual members of the class, individual living things. 

Is there such thing as one human nature? "Human nature is variability itself."[@brown1999human] The variability of human lives, cultures, and beliefs is due to our freedom from the tyranny of genetics and environment. In other words, the major difference between humans as natural entities and other natural entities is our set of rational capacities. Unlike any other creature in the physical cosmos, we demonstrate the ability to speak, to think, reason, deliberate, judge, set projects, pursue goals, reflect, communicate, form societies, create cultures, and so on. 

As Foot says, the major differentia of humans is rational will. 

McDowell argues that humans are different from other (physical) natural objects in that we inhabit "second nature" -- the space of reasons. The realm of normativity, for McDowell, is not the realm of "bald nature" but the realm of reason. As I have tried to argue in the previous chapter, the realm of normativity *is* the realm of ... McDowell would accuse me of trying to "re-enchant" nature; if I deny anything, I deny the quasi-magical aesthetic of the word "enchant." Normativity is, I have been at pains to insist, scientific; judging that an organism fails to exemplify its life-form well is both a normative and scientific judgment. So the question McDowell and others ought to be asking is not whether the thought that nature is normative is enchanting but whether it is *true*. 

'Human beings are rational animals' is a generic. Hence it is descriptive and  evaluative/normative. Initially, we can conclude that if human beings *really are* rational animals that an *irrational* human is ipso facto defective.^[To call a human 'defective' sounds like a schoolyard insult; but it is a straightforward, evaluative description of some people.] I do not here intend to discuss mental illness, disability, birth defect, chromosomal disorders, and other such exceptions to 'normal' functional humans. 

Virtues would be those character traits that rational animals *need*, tout court. They need them to *become* fully rational animals. While I will discuss in detail the natural human *telos* in a later chapter, here I only assert that actualizing the potential latent in human nature is necessarily good for us.[@bloomfield2012eudaimonia]  All of the good things of human life enable the realization of a fully human life. Not all good things are subject to our control. The virtues are among those good things under our control -- good dispositions we each choose to cultivate or fail to cultivate. Unlike other goods (say, wealth), virtues become *what we are*. 


## 3. Why is it "necessary" to be virtuous? Good by definition? 

So virtues are the acquired traits needed by creatures like us, by rational animals. There are a couple of objections in this connection I would like to address here. The first is the objection that the acquisition of virtues is morally optional. Not all theorists are virtue theorists; not all moral agents are theorists. But all moral agents (we can here assume) have the obligation to be moral. 

This objection, as stated, misses the point. By arguing that virtues -- whatever they may turn out to be -- are those qualities needed by practical reasoners, we are not arguing about the *concept* of virtue but that *very qualities themselves*. Any culture, business, family, civilization, will thrive insofar as it is virtuous and disintegrate insofar as it fails. Virtue is necessary because it is human. Justice, prudence, and courage are "needed in any human-scale enterprise"[@geach ], from motherhood, to a successful career, to farming.

Put negatively, the thesis of this chapter is that vices necessarily contribute to misery, unhappiness, and human stultification and stagnation. Human nature is the starting point, flourishing is the goal, and the moral and intellectual virtues are the means by which we move from start to goal. Vices are those qualities that partly constitute human misery. Many kinds of living conditions are miserable; excessive cold or heat; starvation; illness; mental handicap; injury; extreme isolation and loneliness, and so on. But these kinds of circumstances are not *always* and *necessarily* miserable. Rather, being a lying, treacherous, scheming, envious, whining, daydreaming moral agent is truly miserable, even such happens to have a comfortable bed to sleep in and enough money to get through life. Such a person is despicable, a worthy specimen of human failure. 

Some vices, especially intellectual vices, are especially despicable. Not everyone has equal amounts of intelligence conceived as raw mental horsepower. Some children even at a young age excel at doing “mental math” or memorizing geographical names, while others never acquire the knack for it. However, not all unintelligent people are stupid in the deplorable sense: stubborn, unteachable, slow to learn and resenting every bit, arrogant, smug, self-satisfied, and willfully ignorant. Such persons demonstrate intellectual vices noxious to all their fellows except those equally debased, and especially noxious to those unfortunate enough to be their teachers, parents, or guardians. And such intellectual vices are in a special way exemplary of human failing. 

The second objection, building on the above response, is about the very definition of virtue as a *beneficial* or “positive” character trait. To see the problem, suppose we define “boldness” as *doing hard things* and “courage” as doing hard things when it is good. Boldness is, so to speak, value neutral. One can be bold in wrongdoing or bold in doing well. If courage is just boldness in doing good, is this a trivial truth? An analytic truth? The affirmation that ‘courage (doing hard things when it is good) is good’ would appear to amount to the life-altering revelation that 'good things are good'.

This is an important objection but also misses the point. It is a synthetic truth discoverable only by reflection that humans have a nature, a telos, and that some character traits are conducive to the realization of our telos while others are conducive to our stultification. Peter Geach argues that just because an ethical conclusion is virtually unrevisable doesn't mean it is content-less.[@geach1977virtues, Chapter 1] All truths are true, in part, in virtue of the words used. But not all truths by definition are empty and content-less; rather, the stuff of life from which we derive our conceptual definitions or which we must fit into our conceptual definitions is a contentfull task. s


## Situationist challenge

The "situationist" challenge objects to virtue talk on the grounds that empirical research in psychology and sociology indicates that virtues -- supposedly stable dispositions to habitually act or react in particular ways -- don't even exist. 

## Two corolloaries: Our rationality depends upon our education; If human nature is as "rational animals" then the unity of virtues as each depending on practical reason.[@wood2014prudence] 

There are two corollaries to this initial, formal definition of virtues as those traits human beings as practical reasoners need. The first corollary is the importance of moral and intellectual education. 

The beginning of human life, like the beginning of any organic life, is the foundation for all that follows. When a mother drinks heavily or uses cocaine while pregnant, the child is going to suffer the negative consequences for the remainder of his life. When a child is abused -- emotionally, verbally, physically, or sexually -- by her parents, the psychological cost is meted out across the entire life and across generations. By the same token, when a mother eats healthily and takes her vitamins while pregnant, the child is going to reap the positive consquences for the remainder of his life. When a child is given love, approval, empowerment, discipline, by her parents, the psychological gains are meted out across the entire life and across generations. The original source of most people's life maxims are not their ethics professors, favorite novels, Holy Bibles, or therapists, but their parents or other guardians.  

This fact is obvious but we must never forget it. It is important to the argument because we should never give into the temptation to think that the cultivation of virtue is simply a business for adults (least of all adult professional academics) to argue for and against. It is the business of societies and families to do or fail to do every day. 

The second corollary is a partial solution to the conundrum about the unity of virtues. Are there many virtues or just one? And if there are many, are they unified or a fundamental plurality? We should expect, on the basis of our nature as rational animals, that all virtues will be united in our rationality, and that our various concepts of virtue will be united in an appropriate concept of rationality. This is just what we will defend in a future chapter. 

## Conclusion
