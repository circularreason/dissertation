### Agnostic

Another reason many scientific naturalists are squeemish about teleology is a guilt by association; they feel that teleology is somehow religious. I will simply state that my project sets aside discussions about the possibility of the existence of God. 

Obviously, it would be morally relevant if a divine lawgiver were to reveal the way everyone ought to live. But the conclusion of my arguments is that it is imperative upon all of us to become virtuous, whether or not any particular religious tradition is true. I do not wish to *deny* that a divine mind is organizing the cosmos, but neither do I wish to *assume* it.  

Members of particular religious traditions who enjoy the conceptual resources of their tradition may wish to point out shortcomings in my argument that could be filled in; and atheists or physicalists who are wary of any position that smacks of 'non-naturalism' may wish to point out places in my argument that are agnostically open-ended rather than closed. Regardless of the legitimacy of such suggustions, I see three good reasons for adopting methodological agnosticism in this project. 

1. The first reason is sociological. There seems to be no clear consensus within my source authors regarding the divine or numinous. (There is, however, a semi-established consensus among philosophers more broadly that God is dead.[@chalmers2014philosophers]) Some neo-Aristotelians are atheists, some Platonists, others Christians or some other sort of theist.^[The recent neo-Aristotelians seem to be a representative sample of a broader historical population: a survey of the living and the dead would feature theists, atheists, humanists, pantheists, and so on.]   There *is* a consensus that ethics can be grounded, somehow, in human nature. That "somehow" is the focus of my project. 
2. The second reason is philosophical.  One can evaluate and judge the truth or plausibility of the hypothesis with or without a particular religious tradition. This indeterminacy will inevitably seem a weakness to some philosophers, but it seems to me a strength.  
3. The third reason is pragmatic. The dissertation would have become too long.
