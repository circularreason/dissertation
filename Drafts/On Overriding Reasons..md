### On Overriding Reasons

All practical reasons must be ranked and weighed before a final, verdictive reason emerges. Any *reason to φ* is a practical reason that can feature in an overall account of *what to do*. What Anscombe calls "the verdictive ought" is simply what Foot calls the thing to do "all things considered."[@foot2001natural 57] Apparent counterexamples that one might furnish to disprove the point actually serve, with sufficient clarification, to reinforce it. For example, someone might say, 'It's ridiculous to think that I always pursue the good, because I sometimes do wrong.' Sometimes we do the wrong thing. The proper response is that we perceive the bad *as good*. If the immoral person acts wrongly, then he or she has misjudged the good. On the neo-Aristotelian view I am developing, immoral acts are rational mistakes. 

McDowell is incorrect to persist in labeling the broader sensitivity as "virtue." He ought to call it practical wisdom. For the practically wise person is the one who coordinates all other virtues and executes them to good ends. While it often happens that one's individual practical reasons conflict, nevertheless, a set of practical reasons can constitute the *overriding* practical reason: *the thing to do*, all things considered. 

Some might object that the neo-Aristotelian view of practical reason defines away the possibility of immorality. If everyone who acts is "aiming at the good", doesn't this exculpate an agent's apparently immoral motives or ends? Not at all. 

If the immoral person *acts at all* then, according to the argument, he or she must be pursuing some apparent good by definition. To be practical rational necessarily means to pursue something *as good*, as desirable. Someone might say, "But sometimes I perceive the bad *as bad* and pursue it anyway." My view is that we sometimes take a bad or dismotivating reason into an overall reason to do something, all things considered. Just as an epistemic agent might hold a false belief p without affirming the false *as false*, a practical agent might pursue a bad thing without pursuing it *as bad*.  Rather, the immoral person fails in their practical reasoning to correctly rank and order specific goods. The imprudent person, for example, judges that it would be better to eat, drink, and be merry today rather than plan to avoid future ills. The cruel person judges that it would be better to cause suffering than to be kind. 

The foolish person -- the habitually, incorrigibly foolish person responsible for his or her own folly --  is, ipso facto, a bad practical rational primate. He or she is failing to do *the thing to do*. 

Even if we accept that practical reasoning is non-codifiable, it can be done well or poorly. We are morally responsible for doing it well. Jack Weinstein explains that: 

>The term practical rationality is derived from Aristotle’s *phronesis*. It is to be distinguished from *sophia*, a more technical form of reasoning. Practical rationality leads to more approximate conclusions; it takes context and relative facts into account, and it usually leads to moral or political conclusions.[@weinstein2003macintyre 60-61]
