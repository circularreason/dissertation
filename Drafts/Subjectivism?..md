### Subjectivism?

A third and formidable objection some readers might have is that I seem to be assuming a form of realism about practical reason. I have been talking as if "reasons for action" are "out there" and identifiable. 

A subjectivist would argue that the Frey's "practical order" is not really an order "out there" in the world but an order "in here" in the human minds and human  psychology. For example, suppose my friend has lost his job and so I pay for his lunch. Clearly, "my friend lost his job" is a factual judgment I affirm as true. Something else is occurring, though, when I take it as a reason to buy my friend lunch. That "something else" is most simply explained as a motivation or disposition *within me* to take good care of my friends. 


Subjectivism is motivated by considering a problem about the status of practical reasons within (a broadly-construed) naturalism. As Simon Blackburn summarizes, naturalism asks:

>... No more of the world than we already know is there—the ordinary features of things on the basis of which we make decisions about them, like or dislike them, fear them and avoid them, desire them and seek them out. It asks no more than this: a natural world, and patterns of reaction to it.[@blackburn1985spreading] 

Along the same lines, Alan Gibbard argues that "Nothing in a plausible, naturalistic picture of our place in the universe requires ...  non-natural facts and these powers of non-sensory apprehension"[@gibbard1992wise 154]

Anti-realism broadly construed comes in a variety of forms: non-cognitivist subjectivism, cognitivist subjectivism, constructivism, and so on. One currently popular approach is non-cognitivist (or non-descriptivist) expressivism: 

>Expressivism in this form suggests a naturalistic interpretation of practical reason, one that may seem appropriate to the enlightened commitments of the modern scientific world view. It is naturalistic metaphysically, insofar as it makes no commitment to the objective existence in the world of such allegedly questionable entities as values, norms, or reasons for action.[@seppracticalreason]

What each of these quite disparate views share in common is a denial of robust realism. Jay Wallace explains such realism as follows: 

>The basic commitment of realism in this domain is the idea that there are facts of the matter about what we have reason to do that are prior to and independent of our deliberations, to which those deliberations are ultimately answerable. Realists picture practical reason as a capacity for reflection about an objective body of normative truths regarding action (Parfit 2011, Scanlon 2014).[@seppracticalreason, section 2]

For thinkers like Thomas Nagel, subjectivism would then include the straightforward projectivism of Mackie for whom moral values seem objective only because we "project" our deepest feelings and valuings onto the world but also the subtle social constructivism of McDowell for whom the moral law is real only because we legislate it, binding because we bind ourselves to it. 

Realism about practical reasons is what Nagel calls a "defeasible presumption."[@nagel1989view 143] First, pre-reflectively, most of us have no objection to the seeming fact that some reasons for acting are good reasons, and others bad. It is not only fundamental normative facts, such as that is wrong torture animals, that have a quasi-analytic force to them. Fundamental prudential facts such as that *it is wise to plan ahead* seem just as strong. Even the advocate of a procedural view of practical reason has to admit that there is a fundamental norm that *one is not to use ineffective means to achieve one's ends.* 

Secondly, even anti-realism's most sophisticated advocates concede the that realism is the default view. For example, John Mackie admits that "the main tradition of European moral philosophy” accepts objective values. He even admits that moral thought and language assumes it: the notion of objective value has  “a firm basis in ordinary thought, and even in the meanings of moral terms."[^52] Alan Gibbard likewise says, "Normative language does involve claims to objectivity in some sense—that seems clear enough."[@gibbard1992wise 154] Gibbard goes so far as to say that platonism about reasons is common sense.[^53]

Appearances suggest that values are indeed part of the “fabric of the world”; that they are categorically obligating and motivating; and that being a moral person in part is constituted by the recognition and proper response to such values.   

[^52]: Compare with @cuneo2014speech. 

[^53]: "It might be thought that ordinary conceptions of rationality are Pla¬ tonistic or intuitionistic. On the Platonistic picture, among the facts of the world are facts of what is rational and what is not. A person of normal mental powers can discern these facts. Judgments of rationality are thus straightforward apprehensions of fact, not through sense per- ception but through a mental faculty analogous to sense perception. When a person claims authority to pronounce on what is rational, he must base his claim on this power of apprehension." 


### Two Reasons to be a Realist

We have already mentioned the main reason to be a subjectivist about practical reasons: a background belief in naturalism combined with the putative incompatibility of believing in mysterious practical reasons and believing *only* in nature. This is the "queerness" objection.

The argument from queerness builds on the sense that “if there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe” (19). Objective values would be esoterica, akin to non-natural qualities, Plato’s transcendent Form of Good. They would be (like divine commands from heaven)  authoritatively prescriptive yet empirically unverifiable. (Mackie is as poetic as possible in making the descriptive seem mundane and the prescriptive seem mystical.) What’s more, their power of categorical commendation, of obligating us to act in certain ways irrespective of our desires, is utterly unique. The reasoning seems to be that we assume the world is a unified whole, and we know a lot about spatio-temporal, physical entities, include evolved animals like ourselves who are language-users, concept-users, and evaluators. We know that we are motivated by our desires, preferences, by the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain.

The success of the objection that objective values are not saliently different from other unobjectionable abstract entities or concepts like necessity or causation depends on the details. Russ Shafer-Landau[@shafer2003moralrealism], Terence Cuneo[@cuneo2007], David Enoch[@enoch2011taking] have each recently provided these details and shown (though I shall not try to show it here) that indeed objective values are not any more objectionable than other kinds of abstract objects. For example, Cuneo argues that whatever “objectionable features” moral norms display are also displayed *inter alia* by epistemic norms. If Mackie is an ‘epistemic skeptic’ then he must deny the intrinsic, categorical, reason-giving force of such epistemic value judgments as *you ought to believe whatever proposition is supported by the best evidence.* But to deny such epistemic reasons is absurd. 

The interesting thing to note is that moral realism is not just a metaethical position. It is sometimes taken to be a substantive ethical position.[@kramer2009moral] Moral realism is the default view that some things really and truly *matter*. JL Mackie insightfully points out that a loss of belief in objective value causes or corresponds with “an extreme emotional reaction, a feeling that nothing matters at all, that life has lost its purpose.”[@mackie] There is some clue here in that rational action is conceptually constituted by value judgments or evaluative attitudes. 

Along these lines, Foot identifies an argument for the importance of practical rationality on the basis that *we cannot help but value it*. Foot follows Quinn's lead in criticizing a view of reason that makes the goal "the maximal satisfaction of an agent's desires and preferences, suitably corrected for the effects of misinformation, wishful thinking, and the like."[@quinn1992rationality] The trouble, Foot says, is that we *cannot consistently believe this view.*

>He pointed out that by this account, practical reason, which would concern only the relation of means to ends, would therefore be indifferent to nastiness or even disgracefulness in an agent's purposes. And Quinn asked, in the crucial sentence of the article, *what then would be so important about practical rationality?* In effect he is pointing to our taken‐for‐granted, barely noticed assumption that practical rationality has the status of a kind of master virtue, in order to show that we cannot in consistency with ourselves think that the Humean account of it is true.[@foot2001natural 62]

Relatedly, David Enoch's recent volume *Taking Morality Seriously* builds a case for moral realism on the basis that moral realism is the best explanation for the moral earnestness which most of us *cannot but help feel*.[@enoch2011taking]
