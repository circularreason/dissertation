# Introduction: Virtue, Reason, Telos

### Thesis

In this dissertation, I shall defend the thesis that: 

**virtues (such as moderation, generosity, and especially practical wisdom) are acquirable excellent character traits that all human beings as practical reasoners need, for virtues enable us to realize and themselves partly realize our natural human telos.**

This thesis offers an account of the content of virtue and also the ground of virtue in human nature. The three clauses of the thesis provide an outline of the arguments that shall follow on its behalf: (a) virtues are acquirable excellent traits all humans *need* ; (b) all human beings are practical reasoners and so especially need the virtue of practical wisdom; and (c) and such character traits partly (but not fully) constitute the realization of our natural human telos. In the process of clarifying key terms and defending these notions, I shall be obliged to take a stance on several important issues undergoing lively debate within philosophical ethics, especially the recently burgeoning field of virtue ethics: 

- What exactly is a virtue? What is a vice?
- Is it really “necessary for” or "needed by" creatures like us? 
- What is practical reason — what is the relation between rationality and morality? (Can the irrational person be moral, or the immoral person rational?) 
- Does humanity have one telos, many, or none?  

Put most broadly, the main problem to be addressed is: What is virtue in relation to practical reason and to our human telos? 


### Three key terms

The sense of 'virtue' employed throughout is a secondary, rarified, philosophical sense. As Copp and Sobol summarizes:

>It is widely agreed that a virtue is a trait of character. Michael Slote says that an individual virtue is conceived as “an inner trait or disposition of the individual.”[@copp2004morality 516]

This philosophical sense of 'virtue' as a character trait builds on the primary sense; the primary sense of 'virtue' is simply 'excellence.' In this broader primary sense, many traits count as virtues: keen memory, or dexterity, or physical attractiveness are 'excellences'; and Homeric society might praise one as such who stands out from his peers in some respect, whether physical, mental, or moral. But however admirable excellences such as strength and beauty may be, and however socially useful, they are by and large not within one's control; they are "given" by fortune. 

By contrast, some excellences are in one's control: those acquirable by habit, reflection, intention, will, desire -- in a word, those acquirable by practically reasoning things through. The thought that human beings are practical reasoners entails that we participate in controlling the direction of our own lives, if only to some small extent. Or rather, more strictly, the activity of practically reasoning *just is* the activity of participating in that control. 'Practical reason' is our name for activities such as deliberating, reflecting, judging, evaluating, planning, and executing plans. Practical reason makes all the difference in human life, and so plays a central role in neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics. 

'Virtue' in the narrow, secondary sense denotes the excellent traits that are *acquirable* -- such as courage, justice, moderation, and especially practical wisdom. Such traits are human virtues for they are excellence of character. Copp and Sobol continue: 

>Rosalind Hursthouse has attempted to articulate in detail what such a trait would consist in. The key point, in her view, seems to be that a virtue is not merely a disposition to act in certain characteristic ways. To be sure, a virtue does lead one to act in characteristic ways, but beyond this, it leads one to act in such ways for characteristic reasons and in a characteristic manner, to have certain characteristic attitudes and emotions, to be acute in detecting cases in which the virtue is at issue, and so on.[@copp2004morality 516]

These also are *necessary* to achieve one's natural telos. A telos is an end, whether set by intention, by one's culture, or by nature. I shall defend the view that virtues not only enable one to achieve one's goals, nor only to perform a social function, but to become maximally human in the normative sense. 


### The Neo-Aristotelians 

I derive these themes especially from Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Alasdair MacIntyre. My primary sources are the recent neo-Aristotelian virtue theorists, and  It is from them that I draw my themes. It is by presenting, comparing, and critiquing their ethical views that I construct my own argument. For example, I take from them the conviction that the desirability of developing virtues such as courage and practical wisdom depends neither on purely relative cultural values nor on dogmatic conceptions of human nature.  Suppose that all human beings are potentially rational animals. If all human beings are potentially rational animals (and many will dispute it), then an ethical theory grounded in human nature can hope for both objectivity (everyone needs to become virtuous, in one sense of 'need' that shall be explained) and a certain liberalism (people and cultures vary in their decisions about what is practically reasonable). Even admitting variance, it is plausible to defend the view that a virtuous person is truly admirable as an exemplary expression of human nature *as it is* in itself, not merely in our concepts and cultures.

The sub-set of recent virtue theorists I take up for my research are the neo-Aristotelians. Who are they? 

There are many other significant names from the last 100 years, besides the neo-Aristotelians, who shall appear as interlocutors or in footnotes; sadly, they may not receive herein the attention they clearly deserve. One could certainly construct a worthwhile project by analyzing all (or a different sub-set of) these authors. Nevertheless, the smaller set of Neo-Aristotelians are my focus. Every project must cut off scope somewhere. I have limited my primary focus to MacIntyre, Foot, and McDowell. Not only does this limitation keep my scope realistic, but also it allows for a rich discussion of the illuminating comparisons and contrasts between their (often conflicting) views.

### The Form

Much has been written about MacIntyre, Foot, and McDowell's views of virtue, practical reason, and eudaimonia.^[@annas2011intelligent gives a concise and clear account of all three.] However, not enough has yet been do on the dynamic relation between these three concepts. 

All three of the above mentioned concepts are essential to developing a robust neo-Aristotelian naturalism. At the same time, moderns are likely to misunderstand all three concepts.[@sepvirtue. “Three of virtue ethics' central concepts, virtue, practical wisdom and eudaimonia are often misunderstood. Once they are distinguished from related but distinct concepts peculiar to modern philosophy, various objections to virtue ethics can be better assessed.”] Hence, my project will defend not only each part but defend the formal schema as the best hope for developing a fully adequate ethical theory.^[For example, McDowell, Foot, and MacIntyre can be seen using this schema @mcdowell1979virtue and @mcdowell1980role; @foot2002virtues and @foot2001natural; @macintyre1984after and @macintyre1999dependent] My my thesis hypothesizes a relation between all three elements. The success or failure of that defense will not become clear until the project is complete. 

However, it is worthwhile here to make one analogy by way of justifying the inclusion of all three elements as an essential set. Alasdair MacIntyre in *After Virtue* argues persuasively that necessary conditions of an intelligible moral system include:  (a) a conception of human nature -- including human rationality -- as it is prior to deep self-reflection or moral effort; (b) a conception of some human telos or end we ought to realize; and (c) a conception of the qualities or actions that enable a human being to achieve his or her telos. Simply put, a moral theory needs a starting point, an ending point, and (in tandem with those two points) a set of appropriate means to that end. Just as one cannot leave for vacation without knowing (a) where that destination is, (b) where one is at the moment, and (c) the directions — on foot, by car, or plane, or boat or what have you —  to the destination, any attempt to construct a moral theory without all three components (our human telos, our rational nature, and virtues needed to realize that telos) is bound to stultify. 


### The Rise of Virtue ethics

Virtue talk, once a normal part of western cultural and intellectual life, receded to the background or disappeared for about the last three centuries. Its resurgence in the last 60 years has been well documented.[Cf. @crisp1996how] Today, about one fifth of analytic philosophers self-identify as adhering to "virtue ethics".[@chalmers2014philosophers] Not everyone is impressed, of course, with the alleged benefits of virtue ethics; not everyone agrees that "virtue ethics" is a valid category anyhow.^[@nussbaum1999virtue. .] Nevertheless, this figure is remarkably high, given the notorious difficulty of achieving ethical and metaethical consensus and given the long dominance, in academic philosophy at least, of Kantian and Utilitarian theories of morality (to say nothing of the various brands of moral skepticism). 

Howe are we to explain the resurgence of virtue talk? One interpretation is that something is profoundly wrong with modern moral philosophy.[Cf. @anscombe1958 diagnoses consequentialism as morally depraved, and categorizes all the "English-speaking ethicists" from Sidgwick to "the present day" as being consequentialists.] Modern philosophy's turn toward epistemology and away from metaphysics was paralleled in a turn toward subjectivism and constructivism. As modern science turned away from the human toward the cosmic and natural, modern ethics (and politics) turned inward toward the human -- often to the exclusion of the cosmic and natural. While each turn had its merits, each was also subject to excess.  The resurgence of virtue talk can be explained in part, I think, by a desire (within ethics and elsewhere) to correct both of these excesses at once.  

MacIntyre argues that the fracturing of social and political bonds deriving from a shared understanding of and pursuit of the good.^[Though he is classified as a "virtue ethicist", MacIntyre rejects the label insofar as it does not necessitate a real restoration of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue. Nevertheless, he has contributed to virtue ethics, as well as a surprising number of other fields: the history of philosophy, political science, epistemology, the philosophy of education, sociology, and more.] 



Rosalind Hursthouse disputes this interpretation. She thinks virtue ethicists presented their views as *rivals* to the dominant moral theories only because, in the early days, it needed to fight for a position at the table. Now that virtue ethics has a respectable place in our taxonomy of philosophical ethics, such rivalry is needlessly combative. 

The second interpretation (which Hursthouse seems to favor) is that virtue talk can and does enrich Kantian and Utilitarian or more broadly consequentialist ethical theories. She expresses this interpretation: "On this assumption, ‘virtue ethics’ so-called does not figure as a normative rival to utilitarian and deontological ethics; rather, its (fairly) recent revival is seen as having served the useful purpose of reminding moral philosophers that the elaboration of a normative theory may fall short of giving a full account of our moral life."[@hursthouse1996normative] Kant himself had a theory of virtue. Some theorists have been working to articulate a theory they call “virtue consequentialism” or “character consequentialism”.[@bradley2005virtue; @driver2001uneasy; @hurka2003virtue] In contrast to “act” or “rule” utilitarianisms, virtue consequentialism describes virtues as those traits whose possessors tend to bring about the most desirable consequences. Virtue concepts such as temperance and justice are both potent and flexible. They are potent enough to augment concepts of duty or pleasure; yet they are flexible enough to accommodate varying substantive views of what justice is and why it is morally admirable. Certainly, one useful way of distinguishing (say) the ethical theories of Elizabeth Anscombe and Christine Korsgaard would be to point out that Anscombe makes heavier use of the term 'virtue' while Korsgaard makes heavier use of the term 'duty' or 'imperative'; but their theories can be distinguished in more useful detail by contrasting (say) Anscombe's emphasis on the need for moral psychology and a theory of action with Korsgaard's argument that the need to be moral arises out of our reflective, practical identity. 

My own view is that virtue ethicists such as Elizabeth Anscombe, Bernard Williams, Alasdair MacIntyre, Iris Murdoch and others have done a valuable service to modern philosophical ethics by correcting certain myopic tendencies. The "corrections" I have in mind correspond roughly with those "common ground" features that Martha Nussbaum argues exist between those ethicists who talk about virtue — including Kant and Mill and Sidgwick.  

#### Non-distinctive virtue ethics Nussbaum

Nussbaum rightly observes that the three features of “common ground” between a wide variety of “virtue ethicists” also include Kant and Mill and Sidgwick. Her three features are the notions that moral philosophy is (a) about the agent (not just individual choices or actions), (b) about motives, emotions, and settled character traits, and (c) the whole of life.[@nussbaum1999virtue 170] “Even though a concern for motive, intention, character, and the whole course of life was not in principle alien to Kantian and Utilitarian philosophy, it was certainly alien to most British and American Kantians and Utilitarians of the period.”[@nussbaum1999virtue 173] Martha Nussbaum argues that the “common ground” between even diverging views is that we cannot construct a complete ethical theory by discussing only “isolated moments of choice.”[@nussbaum1999virtue 174] 

This “common ground” explains why virtue theorists often discuss examples from literature and why many virtue theorists are female philosophers or feminists. For “literary narratives display longterm patterns of character, action, and commitment” and females have “more often been encouraged by society to attend to, cultivate, and label their emotions.”[@nussbaum1999virtue 176]

The “common ground” does not imply the rejection of theorizing, nor of moral rules. Ancient and contemporary virtue theorists employ both. Nor does the “common ground” imply the apotheosis of local custom and moral tradition. Reflective morality is supposed to rise above the raw material of one’s maxims and habits to trim and add. Nor does the “common ground” imply that emotion and the sub-rational forces of tradition (she mentions “traditional pedagogues and astrologists and religious leaders and magicians”) are to be preferred to rational morality. 

The remaining virtue theorists, Nussbaum thinks,  fall into two diverse groups: the first consists of characteristically “anti-Utilitarians” who want reason to play a much larger role than Mill (or the typical Utilitarian) would have it do; the second consists of characteristically “anti-Kantians” and want sub-rational psychological states to play a much larger role than Kant (or the typical Kantian) would have them do. The first group defend the plurality of goods, rationality’s role in deliberating about which ends to pursue and its role in organizing, ranking, and harmonizing that plurality of goods, the rational character of some emotions, and the need for a rational critique of the broader social and political setting in which “defective passions and judgments” are formed.[@nussbaum1999virtue 180]

On the notion that values are plural, the anti-Utilitarians are united. Virtues are "an organized way of cherishing a particular end that has intrinsic value. Taken together, the virtues, and their orderly arrangement, represent a set of commitments to cherish all the valuable things, and to organize them all together, insofar as one can."[@nussbaum1999virtue 183] The "insofar" clause there is not insignificant. Religiously, the Greeks were deeply persuaded of the sometimes tragic and impossible task of pleasing all the gods. Ethically, they were likewise sensitive the sometimes tragic and impossible demand to pursue all intrinsic goods. One of the tasks of rational deliberation, Nussbaum, argues, is to organize this plurality of goods into a coherent set or to specify indeterminate ends into clear and pursuable ones. Ethicists who have supported this notion include Murdoch, McDowell and Sherman. While giving room to the passions, such Aristotelians elevate reason to a role that can have influence in shaping passions. She says they are "highly theoretical rationalists who would like reason to do much more than it currently does in perfecting our moral and political lives."[@nussbaum1999virtue 187] These are playfully chided as "Prussian" moralists who would not bathe in the sun without deliberating first whether doing so would be in accord with duty. 

One possible response here would be to make an analogy to parenting. Different parents discharge their duty to raise children in vastly different ways. Upper and middle-class and lower-class parents in the U.S. exhibit a vast range all by themselves, not to mention the parenting habits of various classes of various first-, second-, and third-world countries. One plausible underlying unity, however, is the thought that parents (and guardians more generally) treat children as sub-rational. From the ages of 0-1, children do not respond to speech; from 1-5 their speech is limited, and from 5-12 children are fully able to understand basic speech but are most often swept about by emotion, impulse, desire, and social instinct. Parenting habits may be roughly graphed then on a scale of more or less "Prussian" according to how strictly a parent schedules the time for the child's day. Some parents impose rigid form on a child's day, allowing pockets of "play time" in between dressing, eating, learning, practicing instruments, and so on; some parents allow children to run about freely throughout the day, only imposing small pockets of rigid time (at meals, before bed, etc.). We might plausibly suppose that the role of reason is more like that of a parent managing sub-rational children than it is like that of a monarch ruling a polis. 

The other "anti-Kantians" want reason to play *less* of a role -- or at least a different role -- in the moral life. Bernard Williams, she says, appreciated the Greek poets far more than he appreciated the Greek philosophers. Aristotle was excessively rationalistic and optimistic about subjecting the raw materials of our ethical thinking to abstract reflection by the construction of organized theories. 

By this distinction, my view is much more clearly "anti-utilitarian" than anti-Kantian. The emotions, desires, motivations, passions -- the numerous variegated non-rational or sub-rational mental states of normal human psychology -- can be made rational and/or can be accommodated within a life of reason. That is, any kind of plant can be part of a garden with a clear, purposeful, even beautiful blueprint, even if dead leaves and rotten petals may sometimes dot the floor. 

Nussbaum thinks that Foot's "heavily biologized" version of Aristotle is "not closer to but further from the views of practical reason characteristic of the neo-Aristotelians."[@nussbaum1999virtue 192] I'm not so sure Nussbaum is right here, since the biological nature of practical reason is, by any account, a deep mystery more suitable for a dissertation on the philosophy of mind. All I want to commit myself to here is the postulate that human reason (including practical reason) and human biology (physiology and neurophysiology) have a unitary root. And, I do not want to commit myself to either of two (ostensibly but not necessarily exhaustive) disjuncts: either the that root is the physical (but not rational) or the rational (but not physical). I remain agnostic, or suppose that both have a third, neutral root. Blackburn's faint praise of reason as having "independent authority" over "human nature" is the precise view I am working against. If our rationality is not our nature itself, then the neo-Aristotelian project I am conceiving is doomed. 

Nussbaum summarizes Baier as an anti-theory theorist who "understands virtue ethics as an alternative to the 'rationalist, law-fixated tradition in moral philosophy", who praises the voice of culture in moral thinking as often or more than she praises critical voice of philosophy over-and-above culture.[@nussbaum1999virtue 194] Though she later tempered this thesis to call for the "harmony" of justice and care. Her critics among the neo-Humeans and neo-Aristotelians are less comfortable deferring to existing community standards. Regardless, the neo-Humeans are concerned to reduce "reason's exorbitant demands and pretensions to authority; it is a way of grounding morality in other features of human nature."[@nussbaum1999virtue 195] 

MacIntyre also is more willing to countenance existing social practices, if they are sound. "For MacIntyre, appeals to reason never in fact resolve ethical disagreements."[@nussbaum1999virtue 196] This is not right. For MacIntyre, one appeal to reason in one moral tradition will resolve one ethical disagreement, while another appeal to (another!) reason in another moral tradition will resolve another ethical disagreement; and neither will resolve the other. To deny that appeals to reason can resolve disagreements *across* traditions is a far cry from denying that such appeals can resolve disagreements *within* a tradition. Nussbaum ascribes to MacIntyre the monstrous suggestion that "we need to get this functional order through some sort of political authority" who will dole out a "well-assigned role or function" by "authority and tradition" to each person who then "internalizes" that role. In ascribing this view to him, Nussbaum helps herself to a conception of reason MacIntyre has spent more than one book problematizing.  MacIntyre's actual views undercut the very use of the terms "reason" and "tradition" Nussbaum deploys in her critique. In other words, she has not responded to him as well, but responded to a quite different view that might be expressed in the same, multiply ambiguous, terms. 


Nussbaum's conclusion is that "virtue ethics" is a misleading category and represents multiple pluralities of views across more than one axis. "These views have widely different consequences for the role of the professional philosopher in society, for the criticism of existing habits of greed and anger, for the whole project of placing our hope in reason. What I have called the "common ground" is significant: but it can be pursued within Kantianism, within Utilitarianism, and within neo-Aristotelian and neo-Humean projects of many different sorts."[@nussbaum1999virtue 201]

#### Nussbaum 2
Nussbaum's essay says that "virtue ethics" is a "misleading category", but still aims to capture a family resemblance (we might say) between virtue ethicists. Her three features are:  (a) the notion that moral philosophy is about the agent (not just individual choices or actions); (b) moral philosophy is about motives, emotions, and settled character traits, and (c) it is about the whole of life.[@nussbaum1999virtue 170] “Even though a concern for motive, intention, character, and the whole course of life was not in principle alien to Kantian and Utilitarian philosophy, it was certainly alien to most British and American Kantians and Utilitarians of the period.”[@nussbaum1999virtue 173] The “common ground” between even diverging views is that we cannot construct a complete ethical theory by discussing only “isolated moments of choice”[@nussbaum1999virtue 174] 

So Anscombe et. al., have reminded us that the first question of philosophical ethics is "How am I to live?" This question is not an optional one for normal, reflective, adults. This question is not an avoidable one for those who face major problems in life. We need to refocus our arguments in philosophical ethics from looking just at individual choices or actions (viewed from the outside, like a moral critic) to looking at the whole of life (viewed from the inside, like a moral agent). 

A second myopic tendency that these virtue ethicists have corrected, I think, is an *ahistorical* approach. Many neo-Aristotelians and others studied classics or history in addition to ethics, or prior to ethics. Long familiarity with cultures, places, and times other than one's own has a salubrious effect of helping one to see one's own culture and time. (I remember, after my first visit to Mongolia, whose capital city has only one department store, coming back to California and marveling at WalMart.) Likewise, philosophers who have spent long hours conversing with Aristotle or Aquinas are likely to notice more easily the assumptions, biases, strengths, and weaknesses of our own modern context. Jack Weinstein observes that Alasdair Macintyre did for ethics what John Rawls did for political philosophy: where Rawls re-invigorated political philosophy, “inaugurating the dominance of late twentieth-century liberalism”[@weinstein2003macintyre 38], MacIntyre helped to re-invigorate analytic ethical philosophy (especially the ascendancy of late twentieth-century virtue ethics) by freshly examining ethical concepts in light of history.[@weinstein2003macintyre chapter 4.] MacIntyre argues that we can only responsibly use and evaluate practical concepts such as self, practice, telos, or virtue when we know our own history. Since *we ourselves*  inhabit a tradition, we must know ourselves *as* inhabitants of a tradition with a past. We will return to these themes in later chapters. 

A third myopic tendency is, as I have suggested above, the tendency to view morality as *either* a set of rules to be followed for their own sake (with no external "point" or purpose) *or* nothing but groundless social convention. Controversies play and re-play the tug-of-war between those who think these moral rules ought to be followed (no matter what!) and those who think these moral rules are mere conventions that may be safely ignored if stronger motives override them. If morality is one piece of a three-part form (mentioned above), then it is possible to see moral rules as neither arbitrary impositions nor bolts of lightning from a clear sky. 

%**Transition or remove**. The metaphysical background of these neo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists' project aims to avoid dualisms. It aims, rather, at a holistic picture of nature that includes humans and all living things within the cosmos and includes all parts of a human being (reason, emotion, desire, etc.). As Margaret Atkins eloquently summarizes the holistic vision of these thinkers: “Anglo-American moral philosophy [has moved] beyond the limitations not only of A.J. Ayer and C.L. Stevenson, but also of Hume’s focus on sentiment, on the one hand, and Kant’s focus on reason on the other. Contemporary ethics is about the whole human being, seen as biological, social and cultural, emotional and reflective.”[@atkins2005morality]


For Aristotle himself, humans were rational animals with a particular psychology and set of potentialities, including the endowment of divine nous; our species-wide telos was happiness or eudaimonia. A life of virtuous activity was the means to eudaimonia, and detailed information about the virtues -- both moral and intellectual -- were knowable from tradition and ratified or modified by reflecting on the lives of virtuous Athenian citizens. Such was his view, but the message of the neo-Aristotelians is that we can pick and choose from Aristotle, discarding the bad but saving the good.  And the good worth saving is quite a lot. It is not a foregone conclusion that contemporary virtue ethicist will *reject* widespread modern assumptions. Some, such as Murdoch and MacIntyre, did become staunch opponents of certain aspects of modernity. Others, such as McDowell and Hursthouse, become staunch defenders, even while working to enrich modernity with pre-modern tradition. We cannot presume his three-part schematic is *anti-modern* or intrinsically *pre-modern*. 

### Is neo-Aristotelian naturalism normative ethics or metaethics?

At this juncture, it is worthwhile to make explicit two assumptions that undergird this project. The first is that the neo-Aristotelians offer a theory of virtue that is a complete philosophical ethics, both its content and ground. 

Neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics is classified as *both* a normative theory *and* a position in metaethics. This may be worrisome; for example, consider the way professor James Lenman summarizes neo-Aristotelianism as a version of "moral naturalism":

>One important school of thought ... [is] work is inspired by that of Aristotle. This view has its roots in the writings of G. E. M. Anscombe, P. T. Geach and the early Philippa Foot among others. Its contemporary representatives include the later Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, Martha Nussbaum and Judith Jarvis Thomson. As this list makes clear, this is very much the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics. [@sepmoralnaturalism. Lenman acknowledges that Thomson might need to be subtracted from this list and that John McDowell might need to be added.]

Lenman seems bemused with neo-Aristotelian naturalism. A metaphilosophical confusion lurks behind statements such as the one that neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism is  "the official metaethical theory of the main current in contemporary virtue ethics."  For when Foot, Hursthouse, McDowell are classified as virtue ethicists (a normative theory) *and* neo-Aristotelians (a metaethical theory), we might object. Aren't these two different projects? 

One legacy of G.E. Moore's *Principia Ethica* has been the tendency to sharply distinguish primary ethical questions (about what things are good) from metaethical questions (about what 'good' as an evaluative predicate *means*). Of course, the questions that concern modern metaethicists were posed and discussed by prior thinkers. However, the *Principia* gave a distinctive form to these questions and suggested a distinctive range of possible answers. Moore argued that all previous ethical philosophers had failed to resolve their disputes for a failure to define their terms. The question of what the word ‘good’ *means* (and, possibly the same question, what ‘good’ *refers to*) is distinct from the question *which things are good?* The first question is a conceptual question that aims to define a category. The second question is a substantive or existential question that aims to bring other concepts within that category. Moore argued (or according to some critics, *assumed*) that ‘goodness’ was indefinable.[@frankena1939naturalistic] That is, the good could not be defined in terms of any other property. It is false that ‘goodness is pleasure’  or ‘goodness is whatever is most real’. That we pursue pleasure is a psychological claim, not an ethical one; that we judge something to be real is a metaphysical claim, not an ethical one. 

If the good is indefinable, then, necessarily, any attempt to define it will fail. Any attempt to reduce the concept to a concept of lesser intension, or to translate it it as a concept, commits the “naturalistic fallacy.” Moore is clear that the naturalistic fallacy isn’t *just* the error of defining the good as a natural property (such as the pleasant) but also the error of defining the good as a metaphysical or supernatural property (such as the Really Real, or the Divinely-Ordained). 

The neo-Aristotelians are pretty universally critical of Moore's arguments here. Philippa Foot and others dispute his starting points, as we shall see.[@foot2001natural chapter 1, "A Fresh Start?"; @macintyre1984after chapter 2, "The Nature  of Moral Disagreement Today and the Claims of Emotivism"] So the first reply to Lenman as to whether normative ethics and metaethics are two different projects is that they are not *necessarily* the same project. One's choice of philosophical taxonomy will reflect one's substantive views about ethics. Alan Gibbard, no opponent of metaethics, admits that one's substantive views largely determine one's view of the relation between questions of substance and those of meaning:

>Moore stressed the distinction in ethics between questions of meaning and questions of substance, and thereby gave rise to a tradition in analytic philosophy of separating the two parts of ethical theory: the metatheory and the substantive, normative part. Some philosophers have rejected the distinction; some Kantians, for instance, think that if you get the metatheory right, substantive ethical conclusions fall out as some kind of consequence, so that metaethics and substantive ethics are not really separate. Then too, anyone who rejects Sidgwick's and Moore's indefinability claim and thinks that ethical terms can be given analytic, naturalistic definitions thinks that the two putative subdivisions are not really separate. Those who reject any systematic distinction between questions of meaning and questions of substance might likewise reject a sharp, separate subject of metaethics.[@gibbard2003normative 320]

I think Gibbard is right, here. To allow the seemingly innocuous point that procedural and formal questions of meaning are separable from material and substantive questions is to beg the question -- perhaps unwittingly -- against a range of answers to those questions. 

Two observations may serve as evidence. First, we may point out that even philosophers who maintain that (first order) ethics and (second order) metaethics are separate projects betray conspicuous connections between their first-order ethical and second-order metaethical views; advocates of a supposedly "neutral" metaethics often ally with first-order consequentialism: G.E. Moore, J.L. Mackie, Frank Jackson, Richard Boyd, Peter Railton, Simon Blackburn, and Alan Gibbard all endorse consequentialism. (We might even echo Lenman and call moral naturalism the "official theory of a main current in contemporary consequentialism.") Secondly, even if a procedural, non-substantive approach to metaethics can be made neutral with respect to normative ethics, it is still admirably ambitious to construct a theory that pays attention to both. Darwall agrees. He summarizes the history of analytic ethics since Moore, and persuasively argues "that although metaethics and normative ethics are properly focused on different issues, they need to be brought into dynamic relation with one another in order to produce a systematic and defensible philosophical ethics. This mutual dependence is owing to the fact that issues of normativity are at the center of the concerns of both metaethics and normative ethics."[@darwall2003should] 

In sum, the answer to Lenman's confusion is that the ethical and metaethical dimensions of neo-Aristotelianism are inseparable.   My thesis is squarely and ethical argument concerning what character traits are worth pursuing (e.g, intellectual and moral virtues) and what traits count as virtues (e.g., practical wisdom). However, an adequate defense of my thesis requires me to assess more broadly metaethical considerations such as  status of human beings as normative creatures who evaluate themselves and others and who reflect upon what they have reason to do or to abstain from doing.

### Is neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism naturalistic?

The second assumption undergirding this project is that neo-Aristotelian virtue theory is naturalistic. Hursthouse says that "Virtue ethics, or at least any form of it that takes its inspiration from Aristotle, is usually taken to be a form of ethical naturalism -- broadly, the enterprise of basing ethics in some way on consideration of human nature, on what is involved with being good *qua* human being."[@hursthouse1998virtue 192] If we can say what a *good human being* is, we shall be well on the way to describing what kinds of actions are right and wrong, or what kind of character traits are admirable or blameworthy. Sociologist Amanda Maull summarizes this sort of naturalism well: 

>“Drawing upon the works of philosophers such as Philippa Foot, Richard Kraut, and Martha Nussbaum, the claim is made that there are moral properties and facts that are natural (rather than occult or supernatural), which are derived from certain innate dispositions and capacities of living things (i.e., those associated with growth and self-maintenance as opposed to destruction or harm). Human beings have evolved as social creatures with special capacities for speech and reason such that specification of “human flourishing” is more complex and problematic than it is for plants or animals. For the human being, the idea of the “good life” goes beyond biological survival and pertains to potentially ambiguous concepts such as virtue, happiness, and “well-being.” [@maull2013deweyan 577]

The case for my thesis may be classified as sort of neo-Aristotelian naturalism. There are many types of ethical naturalism. Ask two naturalists what 'naturalism' means, and you'll hear three definitions. 

Mine is an ethical naturalism in the broadest sense, as defined by Hans Fink's admirable essay, which I shall refer to often: "An ethical naturalist is someone who insists on a fundamental continuity between the ethical and the natural."[@fink 203 . Fink's is the best discussion I know of on all nine (or more!) varieties of the word 'nature' as it occurs in philosophy. I summarize Fink more thoroughly in a later chapter.] It follows, on this view, that humans are continuous with nature.[@brown2008virtue 1-2] Pretty clearly, one could explain this fundamental continuity in a variety of (perhaps conflict ways), depending on how one explicates the 'ethical' and the 'natural." I warmly welcome what Hans Fink calls an "unrestricted conception of nature."[Cf. @fink 210.] This conception expresses the idea, he continues, that "there is one world only, and that that world is the realm of nature, which is taken to include the cultural, artificial, mental, abstract and whatever else there may prove to be." Throughout, I shall assume that 'nature' or 'natural' refer to familiar objects and properties that exist in the cosmos today: people, stars, trees, penguins, bacteria, and their properties, like 'being an animal', 'bright,' 'green', 'being countershaded for camouflage,' and so on.  I do take my argument to be defending naturalism in the broad sense that I propose to use only philosophical and scientific methods to observe and explain natural phenomena; I bracket (but do not deny) the possibility of divine revelation or the existence of supernatural beings. I do accept the possibility -- indeed I shall defend as essential -- the notion that nature includes normativity. I am entitled to the label 'naturalism' since (as I shall argue) the natural world itself contains facts and norms, descriptivity and normativity. By 'normativity', I mean 'ought' talk and facts to which 'ought' talk refers.[Cf. @schaber2005normative; @gibbard2003normative 321: "[Part] of what's special about morality is that it operates in the ‘space of reasons;’ it concerns justification and oughts. The term ‘normative’ is central to much current philosophical discussion. There's no agreement on what this technical term in our discipline is to mean, but it involves, in a phrase drawn from Sellars, being somehow ‘fraught with ought’."]

Certainly, some critics will insist that normativity is not natural. I ask them to consider the alternative, as I shall consider both, and examine the case I make in chapters 2 and 5. We must aim first for clarity before agreement. It seems to me that the fault line between neo-Aristotelians and their critics is a line between two ways of understanding the difference between facts and values.[@putnam2002collapse] The assumption of Lenman (and others) is that nature is purely descriptive, with no "ought". But Aristotle and the broad Aristotelian tradition deny that the fact-value dichotomy is absolute. They conceive of *nature* as including everything that *is and ought to be.*^[As I understand it, the paradoxical notion of "that which really is what ought to be" is a good way of summarizing the notion of a natural law.] Briefly, for Moore nature as including everything that *is* but not what ought to be -- all facts, no values. Moore and those influenced by him, both naturalists and non-naturalists, have agreed with the underlying assumption that "nature" is purely descriptive. But what if this assumption is mistaken? Surely we cannot let a deeply-held assumption stand without scrutiny. For Aristotle, nature is some facts, some values. So norms and prescriptions can be just as natural as facts and descriptions. If normativity (*what ought to be*) is natural too, then it might be possible that *human nature* grounds ethical facts. And this is just what virtue ethics says. 

In the spirit of open inquiry, we must ask ourselves: what if metaphysical and biology facts are just as natural as some ethical facts? What if the fact/value dichotomy is not absolute and inviolable? Then there might be a tight fit -- perhaps an inextricable tie -- between Aristotelian virtue theory and the metaethical view labeled neo-Aristotelian naturalism. And neo-Aristotelian naturalists argue that nature is or can be normative. 

Now, those who think the fact/value dichotomy really is most accurate may squirm at this hypothesis. They might just double down and insist that metaethical theory is utterly procedural and not substantive -- they might insist that it is utterly neutral with respect to normative ethical theories. I shall have to postpone the argument until a later chapter.

Relatedly, some critics of neo-Aristotelianism in particular exploit one or more horns of a dilemma,[Cf. @hursthouse2013neo; @mauser2011ontological. Mauser describes the dilemma excellently in chapter 5.] questioning whether it is possible to construct a neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism that is both (a) actually *ethical*[@brown2005really concludes that neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism is really naturalistic but is less ethical (i.e., normative) than might be wished.] and (b)  actually *naturalistic*.[Cf. rehg2003conceptual . Rehg et. al., conclude that neo-Aristotelian naturalism is really ethical but not sufficiently naturalistic.] On the former horn, if ethics is naturalistic, then happiness seems to be simply a natural state, like health or pleasure, while the means to that end discernible through statistical analysis of causal relations between acts and their consequences. This seems hardly normative at all. On the latter horn, if ethics is really normative, then happiness is the kind of state we *ought* to pursue whether or not we actually reach it — whether or not, in fact *anyone* has actually reached it. Virtues are those qualities that are acquirable and that we *ought* to acquire, whether or not anyone does or ever has acquired them. This sounds hardly naturalistic at all. 

This dilemma, I think explains the innocent confusion about who actually deserves the title of "naturalists". Lenman, among others, is not sure who counts, pointing out in a footnote that Thomson probably shouldn't be on this list and that John McDowell probably should. He says "McDowell is certainly pervasively inspired by Aristotle and he describes himself as a naturalist. See especially his 1995. But I suspect many philosophers would find his use of the term  'naturalist' here somewhat Pickwickian."[@sepmoralnaturalism]  The confusion arises because Lenman and others[@rehg2003conceptual; @hacker2009natural; @hacker2009human] are not sure that neo-Aristotelian "naturalism" is "really *naturalism*" at all. I think this objection begs important questions, but I shall not attempt to unravel them now. That will be the task for a later chapter. 

I contend an affirmative answer to both questions: neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism is both ethical and naturalistic (in senses to be defined). I hope that by the end, some plausible picture will be painted of the relation of virtue to practical reason and happiness and so that this problem will come to light as difficult yet tractable. 


### The Centrality of Teleology

Arguably, the unifying concept of the schema is not virtue but telos. If we can't even create a shopping list of groceries we "should" buy without a clear conception of the dinner to be cooked, then *a fortiori* strict moral rules and virtues without any notion of the kind of life that is to be lived are bound to degenerate into a kind of pointless legalism. If natural human telos in particular is central to the project of virtue ethics, it would seem that developing a plausible modern virtue ethical theory would require rehabilitating a notion of natural teleology in general. 

### The Challenge of Teleology

However, the desire to rehabilitate natural teleology may seem overly optimistic. The idea of teleology is a major stumbling block.[@ward2013against] One the one hand, supernatural teleology is felt to be "too religious" by those think any amount of religion is too much; on the other hand, natural teleology is commonly supposed to be somehow debunked by modern science. Francis Bacon and others intentionally excised "final causation" from natural science since they feared that empirical and theoretical investigation into final causes “defiled philosophy”.^[Cf. Bacon, *New Organon*, Book I. XLVIII “Although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive, as they are discovered, and cannot with truth be referred to a cause, nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature. And then it is that in struggling toward that which is further off it falls back upon that which is nearer at hand, namely, on final causes, which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy.”] If teleological virtue ethics is somehow distinctive of pre-modern traditions, wouldn't virtue talk be simply outmoded? Wouldn't any attempt to revive such talk be antiquarian and nostalgic? Is there a third alternative to “religious” teleology and natural teleology? Or can one of these disjuncts be rehabilitated in order that teleology may serve its crucial purpose in ethics? 

The skeptical worries must be taken seriously and addressed in detail. The modern world is not the ancient world. Modern science, philosophy, and culture are not the same as their pre-modern counterparts. It is imperative that contemporary virtue ethicists pay due respect to what *has* changed. It is imperative that contemporary virtue ethicists clarify the relationship of their theories to modern science. 

Nevertheless, I think that the sort of realism about natural teleology requisite for neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics grounded on human nature is -- and can be shown to be -- perfectly respectable, modern, scientific, and naturalistic. I shall present the case for this optimistic conclusion in parts, first in a chapter on ethical naturalism and in a later chapter on telos itself. The conclusion I shall defend is a growing consensus that natural final causation is no more mysterious or magical than biological life, or consciousness, or rationality. And hence, the pursuit of virtues is no more obsolete than any other human activity, such as farming, or laughing, or studying astronomy. 

### Suspending Judgment about God
For this project, I set to one side the possibility of supernatural teleology. I do not wish to *deny* the possibility that a divine mind is organizing things; but I do not wish to *assume* it either. While the conclusion of my arguments is that the imperative to become virtuous -- to imitate the virtuous man or woman, to acquire virtues and grow intellectually -- are (if you like) natural laws, I remain agnostic as to whether these norms come from any particular personal god.^[Even supposing moral laws are supernatural laws, in the abstract such a belief is consonant with a variety of theistic views: Aristotle's god is neither Brahman nor Jehovah.] 

The first reason for suspending discussion of this possibility is simply that this inquiry would not afford the space. I hope in future research to analyze the relationship between virtue theories and Christianity, or between virtue theories and religion in general. Virtue ethics has a long history, much of which is embroiled with Greek, or Taoist, or Christian religion. Metaphysical naturalism, on the other hand, has only recently attained dominance. Metaphysical naturalist be a virtue ethicist? Some treat 'naturalist' as virtually synonymous for 'atheist.'[@plantinga2008evolution] Others treat naturalism as merely a method.[@goetz2008naturalism; @sepnaturalism] Indeed, John McDowell is a “relaxed naturalist” yet a critic of “scientism”. And Stephen R. Brown is more of a strict naturalist and concedes some normative ground, allowing that his ethics might amount to something more descriptive. 

The second reason is that there is no consensus among neo-Aristotelians regarding the supernatural; some are atheists, some Platonists, others Christians, still others a different sort of theist. Despite this variety, they hold a broad consensus about the possibility of *somehow* grounding an ethical theory in human nature.^[The recent neo-Aristotelians seem to be a representative sample of a broader historical population: a survey of the living and the dead would feature theists, atheists, humanists, pantheists, and so on.] The “somehow” is my goal in this project. 

The third reason is that natural teleology, if it can be defended, is *compatible with* the supernatural teleology. I do not believe natural teleology *necessitates* supernatural teleology, but it is compatible. It is possible that God is directing all natural affairs to his purposes, including guiding human beings by commands; it is possible that the entire orchestral cosmos is organized around God as the *arche* and telos, and that (to paraphrase St. Augustine) “our hearts are restless until they rest in him”. However, for this project, I wish to see how far one’s ethical outlook can go while suspending judgment.[Compare with @engelhardt1996foundations. Engelhardt is a religious philosopher exploring the scope and limits of secular philosophy. While I shall end up agreeing with Engelhardt that secular moral philosophy (in the form of virtue ethics) remains fundamentally — and perhaps dangerously — pluralistic, I am a bit more optimistic than he about how far natural morality can go. Noah was not a Christian or a Jew was nevertheless "a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God." (Gen 6:9) Even Abel somehow knew what sacrifice would be acceptable.]

      ///  >ACCORDING TO a semi-established consensus among the intellectual elite in the West, there is no such person as God or any other supernatural being. Life on our planet arose by way of ill-understood but completely naturalistic processes involving only the working of natural law. Given life, natural selection has taken over, and produced all the enormous variety that we find in the living world. Human beings, like the rest of the world, are material objects through and through; they have no soul or ego or self of any immaterial sort. At bottom, what there is in our world are the elementary particles described in physics, together with things composed of these particles. I say that this is a semi-established consensus, but of course there are some people, scientists and others, who disagree. There are also agnostics, who hold no opinion one way or the other on one or another of the above theses.[@plantinga New Republic Mind and Cosmos https://newrepublic.com/article/110189/why-darwinist-materialism-wrong]

In this way, my project may be seen as building on Philippa Foot's work to advance a kind of secular natural law theory. Mark Murphy says that "the paradigmatic natural law view [i.e., Aquinas] holds that (1) the natural law is given by God; (2) it is naturally authoritative over all human beings; and (3) it is naturally knowable by all human beings…  Recently there have been nontheistic writers in the natural law tradition, who deny (1): see, for example, the work of Michael Moore (1982, 1996) and Philippa Foot (2001)."[@sepnaturallaw] It may also be seen as a kind of neo-Stoicism, if we follow Elizabeth Anscombe: "One might be inclined to think that a law conception of ethics could arise only among people who accepted an allegedly divine positive law; that this is not so is shown by the example of the Stoics, who also thought that whatever was involved in conformity to human virtues was required by divine law."[@anscombe1958 5] While I shall vigorously deny that normative ethics can survive in an aggressively reductive environment such as eliminative physicalism, I shall for present purposes remain neutral as to whether the "natural norms"[@foot2001natural chapter 2] discoverable in nature are divine.  Some critics may wish to characterize my view of ethics as somehow "transcendent." I shall not waste any more space disputing labels. 


### Why it matters

The rise of normative virtue ethics demands a corresponding rise in strong defenses of the philosophical foundation of virtue. My thesis bears obvious relevance to ongoing debates in metaethics over moral naturalism concern whether and how far moral properties can be identified with natural properties. 

Furthermore, my thesis matters for human life. To see why, consider two questions: (1)  Should I apply to graduate school? (2) Why did become a philosopher? The first question is the kind of question that reflects *on what one is about to do*, where one feels unsure. The second question is the kind of question the reflects on *what one is already doing*, where one already feels confident about doing it. 

Likewise, philosophical ethics can help us to resolve intractable dilemmas we face when life is difficult (as when an elderly relative is surviving only because of extraordinary life support), or when new moral frontiers appear (as when biological immortality becomes a real possibility). These are important questions *because* we may not be confident about the answers, or because there may be as yet no confident public consensus. 

But philosophical ethics can also help us to reflect on life even when it is going well. These reflections are important *because* we are confident about the answer and because we have as of now a strong social consensus.  

Virtue ethicists are especially poised to lead reflections of this latter kind. Normative virtue ethics is, in spite of some prejudices, action guiding.[@hursthouse1998virtue chapters 1-3.]  Furthermore, it is action guiding in the very way most of us need guidance in our actions: not only in tragic moral dilemmas but in the day-to-day humdrum business of living well. Bernard Williams has done as much as anyone to remind moral philosophers that questions of how to live are prior, and deeper, than questions of what is wrong. “Character ethics,” rather than mere “quandary ethics” is what is really needed in the vast majority of circumstances.[@pincoffs1971quandary] That is not to say that moral quandaries are unimportant in life or unimportant in theory; quite the contrary, often times the moral quandary is the exceptional case that can provide a cutting counterexample to a nonsensical view. And moral dilemmas like those encountered in great works of fiction (*Othello*, *War and Peace*, *Gilead*) are real, if blessedly rare, occurrences in a normal human life. But for all this for ninety-nine parts of any given day I encounter very few temptations to do wrong; day by day and even hour by hour I encounter many competing or conflicting goods that seem worthwhile but cannot all be pursued. Check email or grade papers? Write more or spend more time with my kids? Pursue a teaching job in state or out of state? Invest in this friendship or spend much-needed time alone? 

Virtue ethics is, on my view, a very useful guide to action, in personal life, political life, bioethics,[@beauchamp2001principles] business,[@beadle2015macintyre] and education.[@carr2005virtue] It would be an improvement to almost any area of human life if we were aware of our own vices and worked to expunge them, and if we understood the virtues and pursued them. Yet obstacles stand in the way. My dissertation my be understood as an attempt to remove such obstacles and, in their absence, render not only palatable but desirable a pursuit of virtues. 

### Conclusion

As difficult as it is to consider seriously the project of restoring natural teleology to its proper place and using it as a basis for ethical theory that is tenable and useful, I am optimistic it can be done. Many are on the project — biologists, cosmologists, philosophers of science, mathematicians — but philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition are uniquely situated to do so. That tradition promises the resources with which to construct an ethical system including all three elements of MacIntyre's schema while rehabilitating a form of natural teleology that is not only tenable in light of modern beliefs, but rationally commends itself in light of all we now know. The case presented in these chapters aim to show how it might be done, and to begin doing it. 





### Chapter Outline

I shall defend my thesis by way of discussing the three mentioned themes in the recent neo-Aristotelians, especially Foot, McDowell, and MacIntyre. The argument will unfold in the following chapters.



1. Introduction
2. Nature -- Virtue in Neo-Aristotelian Ethical Naturalism 
3. Human Nature -- Virtues as Necessary for Rational Animals
4. Virtue -- Virtue as Excellent Character Traits
5. Wisdom -- Virtue as Excellent Practical Reasoning
6. Happiness -- Virtue as Realizing our Natural Human Telos
7. Natural Teleology Revisited -- Virtue and Nature as Unified
8. Conclusion 


### Apologia

Virtue, practical reason, and telos are age-old themes. Nevertheless, they are significant themes. Treating them adequately is too much for one dissertation. As Glaucon said to Socrates, "The measure of listening to such discussions is the whole of life."[@plato *Republic* 450b.] But my hope is that even an unworthy treatment of a worthy topic will attain some value.
