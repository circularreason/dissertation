\qitem{ Nothing in Man is either worse or better for being shared with the beasts. When we blame a man for being “a mere animal,” we mean not that he displays animal characteristics (we all do) but that he displays these, and only these, on occasions where the specifically human was demanded. (When we call him “brutal” we usually man that he commits cruelties impossible to most real brutes; they’re not clever enough.}%

\qitem{For about a hundred years we have so concentrated on one of the virtues—“kindness” or mercy—that most of us do not feel anything except kindness to be really good or anything but cruelty to be really bad. Such lopsided ethical developments are not uncommon, and other ages too have had their pet virtues and curious insensibilities.}%
{---\textsc{C.S. Lewis, \begin{em}The Problem of Pain \end{em} 43.}}
