This chapter amounts to a criticism of McDowell's sort of naturalism and defense of Foot's. The challenge of this chapter is to overcome all three of these, preserving the ethical import of practical reason we have established thus far. While there is no consensus as to *the* neo-Aristotelian solution to these problems, I shall add to some recent work from Micah Lott, Jennifer Frey, and Christopher Toner which has revealed *a* potentially satisfying solution. 


# two senses of  'natural' 

Sometimes people use the word 'natural' in a restricted sense to mean 'not too different or distant from entities we perceive with our senses or study in the hard sciences.' This sense is *restricted* and *dualistic* in that it separates the natural from the 'non-natural', which becomes a catch-all term for anything different or distant from the sensory or empirical. Other times, people use the word 'natural' in an unrestricted sense to mean 'anything real', regardless of how abstract or odd. This sense is *monistic* in that *anything* that is ultimately counted as real, such as natural laws or mathematical entities earns the designation of being natural. Each concept has its defenders, and each has its theoretical attractions and costs. Nevertheless, one must *choose*. McDowell, instead, defends the restricted, dualistic view of nature while insisting that his concept of nature is the unrestricted, monistic one. The result is incoherence. 


McDowell's concept of science is too restrictive; although he disputes the "philistine scientism" of his opponents, he seems to me to endorse a lighter version of scientism that falls under the same criticisms. He is a scientific realist on one page and anti-realist on another. A third problem is that, even by McDowell's lights, there *do* seem to be primary qualities of nature such as "danger" and "safe" that are relational and actionable like moral qualities such as good and bad. 



### Vice

The natural inclination toward the good in general and a few basic goods does not guarantee success or exclude the possibility of mistakenly pursuing bad things. For we do not *know* a priori what we are by nature. The human life form must be discovered; basic goods for human beings must be discovered -- and they usually are at some point in the course of a normal life. More particular or less basic goods must be discovered with great effort. Mistakes are possible. However, correction of such mistakes is also possible. Once we have a well-supported hypothesis about our form of life, we can begin to sift through many available natural objects, traits, states of affair, and so on to see which, if any, actuate it. 

I said that mistakes are *possible*. It is better to say that the possibility of mistaking something bad for humans as good is essential to a correct neo-Aristotelian account of practical rational primates.  Two sorts of error would exclude the possibility:  First, we might make the mistake of concluding that whatever human beings happen to do, whatever behaviors can be empirically observed, are characteristic "human" behaviors. Second, we might make the mistake of concluding that nothing human beings do is characteristic human behavior; wearing clothes, building houses, working for social justice, and educating young people would all be rendered accidental to human nature. 

To put the point differently, if we hypothesize that all people automatically have detailed knowledge of what is good for them, it becomes impossible to explain why many of us have vices, are ignorant of how to live, and sometimes willfully create for ourselves truly miserable lives. On the other hand, if we hypothesize that no one has any knowledge of any goods, even a general conception of how to live, then it becomes impossible to explain why some people are so intuitively judged to be virtuous. 

An adequate account must allow for Hesiod's insight: "Vice in abundance is easy to get; / The road is smooth and begins beside you, / But the gods have put sweat between us and virtue."^[*Works and Days* 287-9, quoted in *Republic* II, 364c.] Many people are irrational. Many people are not virtuous. But that is just to say that many people are imperfectly human, and not just by bad luck or misfortune; they are imperfectly actuating the human life form by making bad choices, being ill-informed, being lazy, being greedy. 


The mere capacity to reflect on our natural inclinations is a "natural power" of human nature. We are practical primates by definition. Or rather, (since no infants have this capacity,) we have the potential to become such with time.
