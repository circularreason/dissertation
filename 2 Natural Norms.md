# Natural Normativity: Organic life forms and functions

"Biology cannot, or at least in practice does not, eliminate functions and purposes."  --Mark Perlman, "The Modern Resurrection of Teleology in Biology", 6. \


## Introduction

This chapter argues that there are such things as natural norms. Normativity is to be found, in part, in nature, and not just in human evaluators. The instances of natural norms I shall posit are the life forms and natural functions of various species of organisms. 

The major objection this chapter addresses is the "is-ought gap." The is-ought gap is sometimes taken to be *the* problem for ethical naturalism. If ethical facts are real, what are they? Where are they? How can they motivate? If ethical facts are non-natural, then are they real or not? I do think the is-ought gap is a problem for some forms of naturalism. I shall argue that there are at least two forms of the is-ought gap. One of them is insoluable but the other can be solved by appeal to natural norms. 

Ethical naturalists posit a particular relationship between natural facts and moral facts, or facts and values, or nature and normativity. I shall attempt to show that some scientifically respectable natural facts are also real, mundane, normative facts on a level with properties like 'being a penguin' or 'pumping blood.' Natural kinds and natural functions or ends are respectable scientific notions. Though they can be given anti-realist or reductionist interpretations, anti-realism is by no means the default view of working scientists nor the default view of philosophers with a healthy respect for modern science. Polemicists who pretend that anti-realism or reductionism about natural kinds and natural functions are "the" scientific view are propogating their philosophical doctrine; the rhetoric is certainly powerful but the argument is weak. 

The upshot of the normativity of nature for ethics is that if we can defend natural norms, it is at least possible that we can identify human natural norms. That is, we can identify a kind of normativity that is binding on human beings as practical rational animals but that is not merely invented by human individuals or human culturals. It would be natural without being crassy biological; it would be both biological and practical or rational in a way that I will explain later. 


## The Is-Ought Challenge

Many have posed a challenge to the very possibility of ethical naturalism. If this challenge cannot be met, then ethical naturalism is futile. Put the first challenge in this form: 

1. If ethical naturalism is possibly true, then descriptive statements can serve as premises in arguments with normative conclusions. 
2. But descriptive statements cannot serve as premises in arguments with normative conclusions. 
3. Therefore, ethical naturalism is not possibly true. 

The first premise sets out a criterion for naturalism as a broad philosophical strategy for grounding ethics. Normative statements such as "You ought to be wise" or "It is good to be tolerant of people with different views" or "It is bad to bring a gun to school and start shooting people" seem to me true and pretty uncontroversial. But why are they true? And how do we know them? The realist non-naturalist has a good explanation: such statements pick out fundamental, non-natural, moral facts. The naturalist anti-realist also has a good explanation: such statements express the speaker's individual and cultural norms. The ethical naturalist's explanation is a bit trickier. He or she must show how such statements relate to the *natural* facts. One way would be to argue that "you ought to be wise" is itself a natural fact, but that way strikes one as rather odd; another way would be to argue that "you ought to be wise" is a normative truth derivable from some other fact that is natural. Assuming that the natural facts are descriptive facts, the ethical naturalist would have to show how, in general, descriptive propositions can serve as premises with true normative conclusions. 

The second premise seems to render hopeless the thought that we can evaluate things on the basis of what they are. But evaluating things on the basis of what they are is central to the kind of neo-Aristotelian naturalism I am pursuing here. Rosalind Hursthouse says that ethical evaluations of humans and non-ethical evaluations of plants and animals 
"both depend upon our identifying what is characteristic of the species in question."[@hursthouse1998virtue chapter 10, abstract.] In other words, the normative evaluation depends on the descriptive facts of the species: its activities, its life form, and so on. This would be momentous if true. Is the notion that an is statement can underwrite an ought statement even intelligible? 

The is-ought gap is an intuitive notion. The problem originated in Hume. 

>In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary ways of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when all of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence."^[(*A Treatise of Human Nature* book III, part I, section I). 

Hume is often credited with (or blamed for) insisting that an 'ought' can never be derived from an 'is.' Arnhart and MacIntyre argue that Hume himself allows for a kind of inference from "is" to "ought" in other places.^[@arnhart1995new; @macintyre1959hume] I think Moore is the one to blame (or to credit). 

The point is that when it comes to human evaluations, 'is' statements may be interesting but they are useless for practical purposes. Just because "most men wear tuxedos to the Oscars" does not mean that, if I am undecided as to what to wear, "I ought to wear a tux." Just because all human cultures have farmers or hunters who gather food doesn't mean I ought to become a farmer or hunter. 

Yet, if we are keeping ourselves to naturalistic accounts of the human life form and human activities, 'is' statements seem to be all that is available. A detailed and scientific description of human nature could hope to supply a "descriptive ethics" that narrates what such-and-such a culture approves of or finds worthwhile compared to what they find worthless and reprehensible. At its best, a descriptive ethics might be able to identify universal moral approbations and disapprobations. For example, there seems to be a universal (cross-cultural) disapprobation for continual drunkenness. While habits and attitudes toward drinking alcohol vary dramatically from culture to culture, even cultures (like the Bolivian Camba) that drink regularly and drink heavily disapprove of continual drunkenness.^["It is important to realize that drinking problems are virtually unknown in most of the world's cultures, including many where drinking is commonplace and occasional drunkenness is accepted." @heath1982sociocultural.] Such insights might be quite interesting, but the is-ought gap reminds us that they are a far cry from *ethical* insights.

Elizabeth Anscombe is a neo-Aristotelian who is not very optimistic about deriving norms from facts. She mentions that one might:

>look for 'norms' in human virtues: just as man has so many teeth, which is certainly not the average number of teeth men have, but is the number of teeth for the species, so perhaps the species man, regarded not just biologically, but from the point of view of the activity of thought and choice in regard to the various departments of life-powers and faculties and use of things needed- "has" such-and-such virtues: and this "man" with the complete set of virtues is the "norm," as "man" with, e.g., a complete set of teeth is a norm.^[@anscombe1958 14-15.]

She's not very optimistic about this possibility because she does not think this sort of norm that can be derived from observation is likely to result in the kind of morally robust notion of justice that we might want. It's the descriptive norm of justice, she says, is likely to result in a sort of dog-eat-dog notion of "justice" like Thrasymachus held. 

This is the is-ought objection to ethical naturalism, in a succinct outline. I do think the is-ought gap is fatal to some forms of ethical naturalism, specifically those that defend a notion of "bald" nature (which notion I will explore in a later chapter). 


## Natural norms

There is a second and more promising path for neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism to take. That is to start with basic, scientifically respectable natural norms. I call this notion "natural normativity", following Philippa Foot. Some features of nature are properties she calls 'natural goodness' or 'natural defect.' About such qualities, she says: 

>...we might equally have been thinking in terms of, say, strength and weakness or health and disease, or again about an individual plant or animal being or not being as it should be, or ought to be, in this respect or that. Let us call the conceptual patterns found there, patterns of natural normativity.[@foot2001natural 38]

Natural normativity is an indeterminate concept. The way that Foot uses it she means that normativity exists wherever organic life is found. Wherever evaluative properties like health and disease appear, there are real instances of natural goodness and natural defect, then some evaluative properties are *primary qualities of nature* just like weight, color, size, relations of time and space, and so on. There is another sense in which 'natural normativity' is used by neo-Aristotelians like John McDowell. The neo-Aristotelians are of two minds about which sense is a more promising foundation for ethics. Where they agree, though, is in thinking that natural norms overcome or rather undercut the is-ought gap. 

1. If ethical naturalism is possibly true, then some natural facts are genuinely both normative and natural -- there are natural norms. 

Let's first start with natural normativity as a broad concept that undercuts the is-ought gap. Then we'll then define the two sub-types in the offing. Then we'll begin a defense of one of these. The criticism of the other will have to wait until a later chapter.

Nature is full of kinds; sunflowers are not oxygen; stars are not organisms; lead is not gold; but ice and the sea and steam are all water. Natural kinds are distinguished from other kinds but gather up related entities. Zebras and horses and so on are all Equidae. Nature is also full of end-directed activity. Each thing does its own thing: sunflowers grow toward the sun, wolves hunt deer and deer flee wolves; hearts pump blood and eyes see; the sun warms the planet; phyoplankton oxygenates the atmosphere. Such processes are non-intentional end-directed processes.  Non-intentional processes are sometimes called 'teleonomic.' Teleonomic phenomena do not have a director but they do have a direction. 

The explanations for kinds and their teleonomic phenomena are either realist, reductionist, or anti-realist. Realist explanations argue that kinds and their ends are what they seem to be: fundamental facts of nature. Reductionist or anti-realist explanations argue that kinds and their ends are not what they seem. The nihilist argues that kinds don't exist, there is only one thing; ends don't exist, there is only one mechanical kind of process. The reductionist argues that *some* kinds exist, but they do not correspond to our initial scientific categorization; and *some* end-directed teleonomic processes are real but it is reducible to non-end-directed processes.
