1. Foundations and content - order? Sounds intuitive. 
2. Tone - combative and concise? Ecumenical and wordy -- can see either way working. Like things that are punchy and to the point. Be fair to opposing view.s



Any rational agent? or any human?
The good simpliciter (simplichitear)
Metaphysics, Lambda 10, God is the Good.
Part of our humanity is our ability to step outside our own skin, create novels? Is our animality relevant to moral constraints for someone who has transcended their biology or does their rationality -- by itself -- constrain us?

Worry is about THE SCOPE OF THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN.

Part of rationality is an obligation to come to the correct understanding of reality, then that would be true for any rational agent. Any rational agent should use its rationality well? In truth, not all reality matters equally. Insignificant truth (alpha centauri). The relaity that has relevance for us is the relaity we interact with, depend upon -- that's delimiting the relvant scope of reason... 

This is relative to our human life form. 

The paradox here is: as human beings, we wish to know what is true (not just for human beings). 

Address it implicitly. It may be explicit. Are you trying to derive morality from biology? Wouldn't be true for an android? 

Practical reason constrains us; our animality constrains us, which questions can we pose? which truths can we pursue? Answering that is a job for practical reason. 

If we had different senses, we'd have inconceivable concepts. Our current conceptual range is limited. That constrains theoretical reason. It's never divorced from our animlaity, anyway. 

As nietche says, if It's just this thing we do, the way spiders spin webs. THen you've sawn off the branch you're sitting on. To be able to maintain that, you have to conclude... what Plato and Airis that reason doesn't suffer from these limitations. Reason particpates in divine reason. 


-- Some attention to the nature of reason. Not just something we humans happen to do. It has to be assumed to be something that apprehends the nature of reality. Even despite all the limitations we as human reasoners do have. 

Going the way of high pagans is well worth exploring. Seems to me that's a great project. 

Big ugly chapters -- then reduce. 

Write something and try not to look at it for a month or two.
